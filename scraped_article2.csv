Zororo Makamba was one of the two people who tested positive for coronavirus on Saturday.

He was admitted to hospital in the capital Harare after exhibiting flu-like symptoms last Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement.

Makamba contracted the disease while he was in New York and was in isolation at Wilkins hospital, Harare's only isolation facility.

Zimbabwe's health workers wear protective suits during a training exercise.

A childhood friend of Makamba's told CNN he was suffering from a rare condition known as Myasthenia gravis, a chronic, neuromuscular illness, and had undergone surgery to remove a tumor from his chest last year.

In a televised address to the nation, Ramaphosa said the 21-day lockdown will begin at midnight Thursday and he called on the country to ""urgently and dramatically"" escalate its response.

""Immediate, swift and extraordinary action is required if we are to avoid human costs of this virus,"" said Ramaphosa, adding that if the nation failed to act swiftly, it could face ""a human catastrophe of enormous proportions.""

In the week since the country declared a state of national disaster, the number of confirmed cases has increased sixfold, Ramaphosa said, especially troubling in a country with a large immune-suppressed population of HIV and tuberculosis suffers.

""The action we are taking now will have lasting economic costs,"" said Ramaphosa. ""But we are sure that the cost of not acting now will be far greater."""

Residents living in 75 districts across the country, including in major cities such as the capital New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Kolkata have been placed under travel, work and movement restrictions until March 31.

India -- the world's second most populous country -- has 415 cases of the coronavirus, including seven deaths, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. A sudden rise in cases has led to growing concerns over the country's capacity to test for the virus and that a major outbreak on the scale seen in Europe -- the pandemic's new epicenter -- will spread in the country.

Dr. Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said that India has conducted 5,000 tests in the past week and a total of 15,000 so far. There are 111 labs operational with a per week testing capacity of 60,000 to 70,000 and around 60 more private labs are in the process of being approved to further increase testing capacity, according to Bhargava.

The decision to lock down parts of the country comes after India launched the world's biggest exercise in social distancing on Sunday, with the nation's 1.3 billion people asked to observe a self-imposed quarantine for 14 hours.

From 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sunday, offices and businesses shut, people stayed inside their homes, and the usually busy streets, markets and highways were eerily empty across the nation. In a display of public solidarity expressing thanks to the nation's healthcare workers, people across India stood in their doorways and on balconies applauding, ringing bells and blowing conch shells, following similar scenes days prior in Italy and Spain.

The ""public curfew,"" announced by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, was a test on whether an official curfew could be imposed across the country to stop the spread of Covid-19 . Those restrictions were extended across large parts of the country late Sunday, effectively forcing millions of workers in India's huge technology and financial sector to work from home for the rest of the month.

In New Delhi, public transportation, including the metro and rickshaws, has been suspended, all shops, factories, places of worship and offices have been shut, interstate travel has stopped, borders with neighboring states have closed and people are required to stay in their homes until March 31.

Exempt from the order are essential services such as grocery stores, hospitals, pharmacies, petrol stations, telecoms and postal services and restaurants that deliver food.

""Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures,"" Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Sunday.

Several districts, including the financial capital of Mumbai, have banned gatherings of four or more people, and officials can take legal action against those who violate the rule.

Numerous state governments have extended the ""district-ban"" to include their entire states. In the northern Indian state of Punjab, the chief minister announced that, except for essential services, the whole state will be under a lockdown until March 31. Punjab has confirmed more than 20 cases, including one death.

Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Telangana have all initiated state-wide lockdowns versus targeted restrictions of cities and districts.

The central government advised the restrictions in 75 districts as these are places where coronavirus cases have been reported. Local governments can extend those restrictions to other areas at their discretion.

Maharashtra state, which includes Mumbai and Pune, has reported the most cases, with at least 67 infections, according to government figures. Kerala reported at least 52 cases and New Delhi has at least 26.

In the past few weeks, India has taken unprecedented steps to shut its borders, cancel visas and ban passengers from certain countries from entering Indian airspace.

On Sunday, India suspended passenger train services until March 31 after several travelers tested positive for coronavirus. India's mammoth railway network spans more than 760 million kilometers (472 million miles) and carried 8 billion passengers in 2018-19.

Asia spurred into action

The measures in India come as other Asian nations see jumps in cases and rush to implement emergency measures of their own.

On Sunday, Thailand reported 188 new novel coronavirus cases, its biggest single-day rise, bringing its total to 599. Thailand's Ministry of Public Health has announced new measures, which include the closure of dine-in restaurants, shopping malls and amusement parks.

Fears of a second surge in cases from patients traveling from overseas has prompted officials in China to divert all Beijing-bound international flights to other cities starting on Monday.

China confirmed 39 additional cases of coronavirus as of the end of day Sunday, according to the country's National Health Commission -- all were imported cases.

Singapore said it will shut its borders to all short-term visitors and travelers transiting though the city starting from Monday, according to its Health Ministry, which said the majority of its new infections were ""imported cases.""

On Monday, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced new measures that ""place the most significant restriction on New Zealanders' movements in modern history.""

The country will issue its highest alert level in 48 hours and close all non-essential businesses across the country, such as bars, gyms, and cinemas. All schools will be closed from Tuesday while supermarkets and service stations will remain open, Ardern said.

Australia has also taken unprecedented measures in its response to the pandemic. Businesses across the country on Monday followed the government's orders to shut down bars, restaurants, gyms, places of worship and other venues where people traditionally congregate.

""Life is changing in Australia for every Australian and life is going to continue to change,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. ""For many young and old, 2020 will be the toughest year of our lives.""

The state of South Australia declared a ""major emergency"" and shut its border with the rest of the country on Sunday after an increase in confirmed cases from travelers entering the state.

South Australia's Premier Steven Marshall said anyone entering South Australia ""will be required to undertake 14 days of self-isolation.""

The country's biggest state, New South Wales, will shut down all ""non-essential services"" in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus. The measures come after both Tasmania and the Northern Territory introduced similar measures requiring all travelers to self-isolate for 14-days upon entry into the state.

Olympics could be postponed

As sporting events across the world have been canceled, one of the biggest questions remains over whether the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics will go ahead.

Speaking to lawmakers on Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said postponing the Olympics was a possibility.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said that a final decision on postponement will be made within four weeks, due to the vast complexities of rescheduling a massive global sporting event like the Olympics.

""The IOC's decision is along the lines of what I said before, of holding the event in its complete form. If that becomes difficult -- and thinking first about the health of the athletes -- we may have no option but to consider postponing the Games,"" Abe said, speaking at the budget committee in Japan's upper house of parliament.

It's the first time that Abe has changed his staunch public position that the Olympics will start on July 24 as scheduled.

In recent days, a growing number of countries and athletes have called for the Games to be postponed. On Monday, Canada announced that it wouldn't be sending athletes, making it the first country to back out of the Games.

""This is not solely about athlete health -- it is about public health,"" Team Canada said in a statement. ""With Covid-19 and the associated risks, it is not safe for our athletes, and the health and safety of their families and the broader Canadian community for athletes to continue training towards these Games.""

Australia's Olympic Committee has also told its athletes to prepare for the possibility that the Games could be postponed until 2021.

Scrapping the Olympics during peacetime would be unprecedented -- they have only been canceled before during the two World Wars."

Both countries' Olympic committees also are calling for the Games to be postponed until 2021.

""While we recognize the inherent complexities around a postponement, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our athletes and the world community,"" the Canadian Olympic Committee and Canadian Paralympic Committee said in a joint statement Sunday. ""This is not solely about athlete health -- it is about public health.""

The Australian Olympic Committee's executive board met by teleconference Monday and unanimously agreed that an Australian Olympic team could not be assembled given the changing circumstances across the world, the committee said in a statement.

The committee also said ""our athletes now need to prioritise their own health and of those around them, and to be able to return to the families.""

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

The quarantines and local-level lockdowns put in place to combat the coronavirus outbreak will likely cause Chinese economic output to decline in the first three months of the year -- the first contraction in more than four decades for what was formerly one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Though the extent and duration of the downturn will not be known for several months, it is already becoming clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping will leverage the crisis to further bolster his power as the country's leader as he seeks to return China to what he views as its rightful position as a preeminent global power.

This may seem surprising given Xi's initial response to the Covid-19 outbreak. Xi disappeared from sight for more than a week just days after Beijing was forced to acknowledge the virus, spurring social media speculations and criticism of his aloofness. This reflected especially poorly on Xi because the ruling Chinese Communist Party has long predicated its legitimacy on effective governance, including delivering consistent economic growth and rising standards of living.

So why is Xi poised to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever?

First, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will be a key channel of post-outbreak stimulus. Xi has overseen a renaissance of the country's SOEs, forcing mergers to create national champions in key sectors, including rail, nuclear and renewable energy and building materials, among others. And with economic activity constrained by the measures taken to combat the coronavirus, SOEs will take on an even larger national role. They will likely receive much-needed financing, given their connections to state-owned banks. And Beijing is pushing for more infrastructure investment to support the economy, an area where SOEs play a prominent role.

Meanwhile, privately owned small and medium enterprises have been disproportionately impacted by the lockdowns that blanketed the entire country, as locally-owned shops and restaurants with thin cash margins and greater difficulties in restarting business activity face imminent bankruptcy. The result: a further shift in economic weight toward SOEs controlled by Beijing and focused on implementing Xi's policy priorities.

They should not be sold in stores to consumers, said 3M CEO Mike Roman in a CNBC interview Monday.

3M is the largest maker of medical face masks, specifically the N95 respirator mask.

Hospitals nationwide are facing an acute shortage of PPE (personal protective equipment) such as N95 masks, gloves and surgical gowns amid the coronavirus pandemic. In the United States, more than 38,000 Americans have been infected across all 50 states, and at least 414 people have died.

In light of this desperate need, Roman said 3M's N95 masks should not be showing up in stores, he told CNBC.

Roman said he was ""disappointed"" that the masks were selling in some stores over the weekend, alluding to Target.

It's WhatsApp.,"London (CNN Business) Governments and medical officials are scrambling to provide the public with accurate and timely information about the novel coronavirus. But those efforts are being undermined by the spread of medical misinformation and fake cures on one of the world's most popular messaging platforms.

WhatsApp, which is owned by, is coming under renewed scrutiny over how it handles misinformation as the coronavirus pandemic rampages across the globe, infecting more than 200,000 people and killing over 8,000, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

The platform is being used to spread messages that often contain a mixture of accurate and misleading claims that have been debunked by medical experts. The problem is now so acute that world leaders are urging people to stop sharing unverified information using the app.

""I am urging everyone to please stop sharing unverified info on WhatsApp groups,"" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Monday on Twitter . ""These messages are scaring and confusing people and causing real damage. Please get your info from official, trusted sources.""

The misinformation often arrives on smartphones in messages that have been forwarded by a friend or relative, and includes information purportedly from a prominent doctor or a friend of a friend who works in government. Many of the messages mix sound advice, such as how to wash your hands properly, with misinformation. One false claim that is circulating: drinking warm water every 15 minutes will neutralize the coronavirus.

Because WhatsApp messages are encrypted in a way that allows them to be seen only by the sender and recipient, public health officials and watchdog groups are struggling to track the spread of coronavirus misinformation. WhatsApp itself does not monitor the flow of messages on the platform.

""It is clear ... that a lot of false information continues to appear in the public sphere. In particular, we need to understand better the risks related to communication on end-to-end encryption services,"" European Commission Vice President Věra Jourová, who oversees the bloc's efforts to fight disinformation, said in a statement Tuesday.

WhatsApp says it has taken steps to curb misinformation, it is donating to fact checking groups and users can forward messages to special accounts that can verify information.

""There are over a dozen [local fact checkers] so far, and we want more to be able to do their important work so rumors are identified and countered,"" Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, said Wednesday on Twitter.

WhatsApp is promoting the fact checking organizations and health ministries on Facebook, with free and special clickable ads that pull up a new WhatsApp chat with the corresponding organization.

Jourová welcomed the new measures but suggested more needs to be done to address the issue of misinformation.

""WhatsApp has informed the Commission about some measures it put in place to limit the spread of disinformation, but most of the problematic content seems to be the so-called organic content, i.e. generated by users themselves,"" she said.

Misinformation spreads

In recent days, CNN Business has seen multiple versions of a message with information purportedly from medical professionals concerning four young people infected with coronavirus who had been taking anti inflammatory drugs.

In one version, written in English, the young people are hospitalized in Cork, Ireland. In another, written in Hebrew, they are in Toulouse, France. Medical officials in both cities have dismissed the story of the four young people as fake. (For more on anti inflammatory drugs and coronavirus click here .)

One popular — but incorrect — theme is that ""hot fluids neutralize the virus, so avoid drinking ice water,"" or that drinking water every 15 to 20 minutes will flush the virus to your stomach where it will be killed by acid.

An image spread on WhatsApp and other platforms shows an illustration of a human head and throat. The accompanying message, written in Spanish, claims that drinking a lot of water and gargling with salt or vinegar will eliminate the virus. ""Spread this information because you could save someone,"" it says.

Other messages sent on WhatsApp have warned that countries will go on lockdown and that people need to stock up on supplies. In the United States, the messages claim the lockdown is part of the ""Stafford Act"" and that people should ""stock up on whatever you guys need to make sure you have a two week supply of everything."" The US National Security Council tweeted that this message is fake.

While similar messages are being shared via text and on other social media, their proliferation on WhatsApp and the difficulty in stopping them makes the service an outlier compared to sister platforms Facebook and Instagram, which have taken more robust and direct efforts to combat coronavirus misinformation. (All three platforms are owned by Facebook.)

How to stop the spread

WhatsApp, which compares itself to traditional SMS text services instead of social media platforms, encrypts conversations, meaning they only live on users' phones. Though encryption is seen as a plus for security, WhatsApp is blind to what's being said in messages — and that makes it difficult to police or moderate content.

On Facebook, third party fact checkers hunt down misinformation, and when they mark something as false, users are shown a message that directs them to a correcting or clarifying post before they are permitted to share the misinformation.

Cristina Tardáguila, associate director of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), suggested last week that WhatsApp could include a message asking people ""are you sure this is true?"" before they send a message related to coronavirus.

But Carl Woog, a WhatsApp spokesperson, told CNN Business that it's not something the platform would be able to do because WhatsApp is encrypted, and that ""passing remote judgment on deciding what can be sent and not be sent in a real time message would be unprecedented"" for a text or SMS service.

Aviv Ovadya, founder of the Thoughtful Technology Project , pointed out on Twitter that WhatsApp has developed prompts for when users are sent suspicious website links. But the misinformation about the coronavirus shared on WhatsApp is often in plain text form.

WhatsApp has made efforts to assist health officials in getting accurate information to the public.

On Wednesday, the company announced it had donated $1 million to the IFCN, launched a coronavirus information page and said it would help organizations like the WHO and UNICEF provide messaging hotlines for people around the world.

Health ministries in countries such as Israel, Singapore, South Africa and Indonesia are already providing updates directly on WhatsApp, through automated accounts.

Last year, WhatsApp imposed limits on how many times a message could be forwarded, after viral hoax messages in India contributed to more than a dozen lynchings in 2018. Users can now only forward one message to five chats, and group sizes are limited to 256 members. Woog said these measures have decreased forwards on the service by 25%.

Ultimately experts say some of the best ways to counter misinformation are public education, teaching people about the coronavirus and how to be smart consumers of information.

But when asked whether WhatsApp would consider sending a mass message to all users, urging them to seek accurate information from official sources, Woog said it's not something they're technically able or planning to do.

""We believe the most important thing we can do is to empower health ministries and doctors to engage with citizens and patients right on WhatsApp,"" said Woog."
http://edition.cnn.com/,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/KlnsnygiAw8/index.html,2019-09-18T17:44:32,US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"(CNN) If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it. Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study .

But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014.

If we continue on this path, ""cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,"" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.

Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development.

""We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,"" Nowak said.

More than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says.

""Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region.""

The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation.

The lost value amounted to $96 million a year.

Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society:

Heat reduction: Trees Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings , parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. ""Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,"" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . ""A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,"" the authors wrote.

Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere.

Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. ""The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up.""

Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil.

Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams.

Noise reduction: Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits.

Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says.

Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property.

Wildlife habitat: Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life.

Planning for trees

Nowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, ""and people don't like raking leaves."" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. ""You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees.""

""You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways.""

Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help ""affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being.""

Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.

""A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,"" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.

""That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore.""

The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.

""We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure."" Levine adds. ""We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. ""

How you can help stop tree loss

Protect what you have: Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. ""We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true.""

Prune the dead limbs out of your trees: If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said.

Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice.

Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary: Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. ""It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow.""

Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control.

Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because ""I hear people running their lawn mowers."" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.

Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

In Miami these days, it's all about elevation, elevation, elevation.

And long before melted ice caps wash over Ocean Drive, one of America's most vulnerable big cities is becoming a test case for the modern problem of climate gentrification.

While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among America's most valuable.

Even now, as more frequent ""king tides"" bubble up through Florida's porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed.

""Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago,"" says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miami's Geosciences Department. ""The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now.""

The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets.

In Pinecrest, artist Xavier Cortada installed murals showing how many feet above sea level intersections are.

Neighbors in Pinecrest formed America's first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president.

Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet.

But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach.

They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere.

""They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money!"" says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. ""We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that it's close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, it's because we are positioned at a higher altitude.""

Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miami's housing crisis.

""If you sell your home in Little Haiti, you think that you're making a big deal, and it's only after you sell, and then you realize, 'Oh, I cannot buy anywhere else.'""

Marleine Bastien, center, protests with residents and activists against the Magic City plans.

After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil.

Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation.

A view of downtown Miami and South Beach from a plane shows the oceanfront development of the past.

They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasn't enough for Bastien. ""This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti,"" she says. ""Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide.""

She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June.

""The area we took was all industrial,"" says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. ""There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy.

""Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, that's not feasible. It's not realistic. But we've listened to them.""

He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti.

But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. ""Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways,"" she says with a resigned head shake. ""Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government.""

A woman uses an umbrella for shade as she walks on a hot day in Miami.

""(Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring,"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me. ""But we haven't seen any direct evidence of it yet.""

Suarez is the rare Republican who passionately argues for climate mitigation plans and helped champion the $400 million Miami Forever bond, approved by voters to fund action to protect the city from the ravages of higher seas and stronger storms.

Miami Mayor Francis Suarez championed a plan to tackle the impact of the climate crisis.

""We actually created in our first tranche of Miami Forever, a sustainability fund for people to renovate their homes so that they can stay in their properties rather than having to sell their properties,"" he says.

But that fund is a relatively small $15 million, not enough to dent a housing crisis that grows with each heat wave and hurricane, in a city where over a quarter of residents live below the poverty level.

What's happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of a ""climate apartheid"" that the United Nations warns is ahead , where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind.

Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently.

And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. ""Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,"" Alston wrote last month."
http://edition.cnn.com/,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/Pa_SMoc1110/index.html,2019-07-12T10:20:40,Climate change: How rich people could help save the planet,"(CNN) Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us -- they also have bigger carbon footprints.

The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere.

Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars -- they all have a carbon footprint.

Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change

But some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference.

Spend wisely

The buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people.

Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical ""super-rich"" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.

Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. ""Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,"" she said.

""Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,"" said Otto. ""For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying.""

In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.

German architects Aktivhaus say this home generates twice as much energy as it consumes.

Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes.

""A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,"" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities.

""High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,"" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods.

Divestment

As well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in.

Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.

Steam rises from a coal-fired power plant in Germany.

But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment.

Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest

Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio , who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies.

""You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,"" said Otto.

And with divestment, a little can go a long way. ""We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,"" said Otto. ""If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.""

Wealth means power

Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers.

Otto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.

""Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something,"" said Otto. ""There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving.

""But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks,"" she explained.

Fund climate research

The wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy.

In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an ""extraordinary increase"" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues.

""We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy,"" the letter said.

There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action: A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years.

Role models

The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions.

""High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth,"" said Otto. ""It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like.""

For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters.

Ryanair is among the EU's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, according to EU data. The rankings include power stations, manufacturing plants and aviation.

""We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth,"" said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs.

""We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a ""good life"" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said."
http://edition.cnn.com/,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/CNsC__DLMIY/index.html,2020-03-22T01:13:49,Cultural events are being canceled amid the coronavirus. So what?,"Written by Stephy Chung, CNN

Major events around the world have been canceled or postponed as the race to contain the novel coronavirus continues. The cultural sector -- with its numerous fairs, shows and festivals -- has also been significantly impacted.

Countless art institutions, museums and galleries have been temporarily shuttered. The Louvre in Paris, which houses the famous ""Mona Lisa,"" is closed until further notice. A blockbuster exhibition marking the 500th anniversary of the death of Italian Renaissance painter Raphael was suspended just days after opening in Rome.

Organizers have pulled the plug on Glastonbury, the UK's largest music festival, which was celebrating its 50th anniversary. In New York, the lights are out on Broadway, with all performances canceled until mid-April. And fashion's biggest night, The Met Gala , has been postponed.

Of course, such closures can seem immaterial compared to the public health crisis posed by Covid-19 and its rising death toll. People are getting sick; they are worrying about how to stay safe, access care, look after loved ones or stay in work.

But culture, even during the most extraordinary of times, should not be overlooked. Rather, it should be embraced as means for respite, escape and nourishment. For a brief moment, you can lose yourself in the brushstrokes of a centuries-old painting or feel completely immersed at a live concert.

At a time when misinformation, polarization and blatant hate are particularly confounding, culture can be humanizing and educational. It's an alternative means by which to digest an increasingly complex and anxiety-fueled world.

Financial costs, lost opportunities

Disruptions to the cultural calendar will result in catastrophic financial losses. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, for instance, is bracing for a projected $100 million shortfall and possible layoffs due to the coronavirus, according to The New York Times . Culture, after all, is big business.

Cancellations don't solely affect ticket holders, but entire ecosystems built around an event.

In the case of Art Basel in Hong Kong the impact was felt on many levels, from organizers to blue-chip galleries, some of which bank on multi-million dollar sales, to the city's already reeling tourism sector (last year, the fair attracted almost 90,000 visitors from over 70 countries). Instead, gallerists have been exhibiting virtually via online ""viewing rooms"" over the past few days, during the event's original dates. Art Basel's global director Marc Spiegler said the rooms would help galleries partially recover sales in a ""completely new environment.""

""This is not the moment where we completely redefine what we do. We are selling unique objects to individual people, and it's a market which is based on trust not only on the part of the buyer, but also the seller,"" he said of the invaluable relationships built when deals are made in person.

""I hope that galleries have the time and focus to really think about how to digitally market what they are doing -- we'll help them with that. And in a sense, the fair business will continue, but people will have learned how to 'play' digital to ... supplement the business that isn't happening and hasn't been happening for a long time in the gallery spaces themselves.""

While big players can likely sustain one-off cancelations, smaller businesses and young talent may be hit hardest. That's where intangibles, like missed opportunities, come in.

""There's so much that's unknown at the moment, but the rug was pulled out from under us when it was supposed to be our launchpad."" Filmmaker Nicole Riegel

South by Southwest (SXSW), the two-week film and music festival, attracts thousands of visitors to Austin, Texas every year. According to the city's mayor Steven Adler, 2019's edition injected $350 million into the local economy -- making the decision to shutter this year's event even more difficult.

Los Angeles-based filmmaker Nicole Riegel, said the SXSW cancellation was ""devastating.""

Festivals are where ""you get that special premiere moment, you get exposure, you get interviews, you get audiences ... there's a lot of work that can come your way,"" she added.

""There's so much that's unknown at the moment, but the rug was pulled out from under us when it was supposed to be our launchpad.""

Riegel was set to debut her film ""Holler,"" a coming-of-age story about a young girl looking for her ticket out of a small town in Ohio. A town, as the film describes , ""where American manufacturing and opportunity are drying up.""

The movie was five years in the making and cost $1 million to produce. ""My film touches upon the reality of young girls who live in these towns across America and are slipping through the cracks of a fractured system that feels very rigged against them,"" she explained.

She describes ""panic"" in the industry, particularly among first-time filmmakers who are seeking other distribution channels, such as online streaming platforms, in lieu of screening at the festival. But that's not an option for Riegel.

""Everyone on 'Holler' worked too hard,"" she said. ""I won't ... throw it online for free. That's insulting to the work of my cast and crew.""

Rethinking models, new innovation

With large gatherings put on hold, creatives are finding inventive ways to engage virtually.

Berlin-based pianist Igor Levit, saddened by the thought of empty concert halls, has been experimenting with what he calls, ""social media house concerts,"" passionately pounding out classical music repertoires on Twitter and Instagram Live ""until we meet again to do this in real life.""

Helen Marriage, founder of London-based public art practice Artichoke -- the creative director of Galway 2020 -- said that plans have had to shift, last-minute.

According to Marriage, about 20,000 people were expected to witness ""Savage Beauty,"" a project by Finnish artist Kari Kola to illuminate the Loch Na Fuaiche in rural Ireland and its mountainous scenery. The colorful site-specific work, which was to be held over a four-day period was instead, documented and presented as a "" special digital version ."" ""This way (we) could show that the organization still had resilience, is imaginative and is continuing to support its artists,"" Marriage said.

In Italy, where the whole country is on lockdown, artists are live-streaming performances in lieu of the Milan Triennale, which showcases architecture, design and art projects. ""We see this (the quarantine) as an opportunity to question our habits in terms of exhibition-making and test new forms of cultural production compatible with the conditions within which we operate,"" the Triennale's chief curator of design Joseph Grima wrote on Instagram, posting images of performers in gas masks obscured by dramatic plumes of colored smoke.

""This is a period of experimentation,"" said the Guggenheim Museum's senior curator of Asian art, Alexandra Munroe, who pointed to virtual exhibitions and the #museumfromhome hashtag as examples of how visitors could still access art. Munroe also said that a ""self-questioning"" is taking place across the art world, particularly in regard to the necessity of international art fairs and their subsequent environmental impact.

""The combination of these disastrous scenarios for the planet, including the pandemic, is causing people to rethink what has become, in the last decade, a manic habit of participating in fairs that can amount to two a month if you are a large gallery,"" she said. ""Is it worth the exhaustion, the travel, the carbon footprint?

""Being someone who has habitually gone to all of them, I can also say it's exhausting as a curator and consumer who is building a collection for the museums that I work with ... I think (the pandemic) is an interesting reminder that we all did our jobs pretty well before this kind of travel and cultural expectation set in.""

It's a sentiment echoed in other industries, including fashion, where the crammed biannual cycle of New York, London, Milan and Paris weeks, one after the other, has created an unsustainable yet almost compulsory schedule for editors, buyers, designers and models -- to be seen and stay relevant. Then there are the exotic cruise shows , held in the summer and increasingly reliant on spectacle and traveling to far-flung places, from Fendi on the Great Wall of China to Chanel's runway on a man-made island in Dubai. Immersive technologies, such as virtual showrooms, are emerging as a potential solution for the months ahead.

""People aren't caving in. Everyone is doing something different, or experimental. It's a huge learning curve."" Boh Projects founder Bohan Qiu

In China, where the coronavirus has upended life since January, creatives have already adapted to new working realities. Due to travel restrictions, many designers missed the US and European fashion weeks, but are now working towards Shanghai Fashion Week, which was initially postponed but is now set to open Tuesday in a largely digital format.

Bohan Qiu, who heads communications consultancy Boh Project, is working with labels to stage shows and present their collections virtually. Some of these will be elaborate, with computer-generated models walking against surreal backdrops. ""People aren't caving in,"" said Qiu. ""Everyone is doing something different, or experimental. It's a huge learning curve.""

Younger designers, and those fluent in digital marketing, may have the advantage. ""Right now, bigger brands are starting to suffer. They never really had this mindset (of having to go digital). But smaller brands, who are used to working with lower costs and building a strong presence, already know how to live-stream super well, and make a message on (platforms such as) Little Red Book, WeChat and Tik Tok,"" Qiu said, of the ""flattened"" playing field.

But even those adept at using digital technologies say that absorbing culture in person can't be replicated. Experimental Japanese art collective teamLab, which is comprised of self-described ""ultra-technologists,"" develop immersive digital experiences, including a 10,000 square meter digital-only museum

""We have five senses. If you're close to (art), even drawings or sculptures, you can smell the paint. This is our principle, and we won't change this part,"" said teamLab's communications director, Takashi Kudo, who is looking forward to art spaces safely reopening.

In the meantime, he continues his ""task"" as an artist -- to create, even in difficult times. ""I can't just sit down and be hopeless. I think what's more important, at least as an artist, is to seek out and affirm an idealistic part of humanity, and present an idea of the future.""

If planting more trees can replenish forests and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, then could we also repopulate the Arctic with ice?

That's a question posed by a team of Indonesian designers with an eye-catching response to the climate crisis: iceberg-making submarines.

The idea, recently named runner-up in an international design competition appealing for radical approaches to sustainability, is the latest in a series of new proposals for ""refreezing"" the Earth's poles -- from sprinkling them with artificial sand to blasting seawater into the sky to brighten the clouds.

Led by 29-year-old architect Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha, the group envisaged a submersible vessel capable of producing 16-foot-thick, 82-foot wide hexagonal icebergs.

The process would begin with the submarine dipping beneath the surface to fill its central cavity with seawater. Salt would then be filtered out, raising water's freezing point by more than 3 degrees Fahrenheit, after which a hatch closes over the chamber to protect it from the sun.

The proposed vessel would be large enough to host research and leusire facilities. Credit: Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha

An iceberg would then form naturally inside, before being ejected a month later. According to the team behind the project, the hexagonal shape may encourage the icebergs (or ""ice babies"" as Kotahatuhaha refers to them) to interlock with one another and form larger frozen masses.

It's an early concept design, and many questions remain. The designers are yet to finalize how the vehicle would be powered, though they intend for the vessel to be fully sustainable. But could the submarines, in theory, work?

Andrew Shepherd, a professor of Earth observation at the UK's Leeds University, described the idea as an ""interesting engineering solution,"" though he questioned the project's scalability. He estimated that replacing polar ice at the same rate it has disappeared in the last four decades would require around 10 million submarines.

""That's a lot of machines,"" Shepherd said in an email. ""For context, that's not far off the total number of Model-T Fords built in all time.""

The proposed submersible would be capable of producing 16-foot-thick, 82-foot wide hexagonal icebergs. Credit: Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha

But for Kotahatuhaha, the proposal is not only about feasibility -- it's about finding a different way to approach climate challenges.

""The Arctic has lost ice from year to year in the last decade,"" he said on the phone from Jakarta. ""So we tried to solve the problem through a different way of thinking.

""Richer countries have millions to spend on (sea walls and) protection, but what about poor countries with no budget for (defending against) rising sea levels? This is a problem the world now faces together. We have a different approach: Rather than defending against sea level rises, we think it's better (to carry out) some kind of intervention to tackle the problem.""

Protecting the poles

A possible flaw in the proposal -- and others like it -- is that making ice does not significantly alter sea levels. If the ice is still floating in the water it formed from, then sea's overall mass doesn't change. (The icebergs would have to be ""moved on to land"" if they were to lower sea levels, Shepherd said).

But reversing, or at least slowing, the alarming decline of polar sea ice is about more than rising oceans. Snow and ice reflect significantly more sunlight than open water does, so bigger, frozen surfaces mean more radiation is sent back to space.

""If enough (ice) is made, then it could ultimately alter the planet's temperature, which could in turn lead to reduced land ice melting and reduced sea level rise from that source,"" Shepherd said, offering an alternative advantage to making icebergs. ""But there are lots of 'ifs' along the way.""

Farfetched as it may sound, the idea of re-freezing the poles through geoengineering is being explored elsewhere in academia. In 2017, a team of researchers at Arizona State University revealed a concept for a wind-powered pump that sucks up seawater and sprays it out onto the ice's surface, where it will freeze faster.

The scientists' research suggested that using 10 million of the devices could add a meter (3.2 feet) onto the surface of a polar ice sheet over the course of a winter.

Other proposals have focused on protecting ice rather than creating it.

Since 1990, British physicist John Lanham has explored a technique known as marine cloud brightening, in which particles -- such as the salt in seawater -- are injected into clouds to increase the amount of sunlight they reflect. Together with Stephen Salter, a professor of engineering design at the University of Edinburgh, Lanham developed a concept design for a floating ""spray vessel"" which could fire seawater into the clouds via a series of masts.

Brighter clouds could mean that less sunlight reaching the Earth's surface, thus reducing summer melting and encouraging the replenishment of ice during the winter.

Elsewhere, the US non-profit group Ice911 has spent the last decade developing a highly reflective sand-like material that can be scattered on ice to protect it from the sun's rays.

Last year, the group tested its ""hollow microspheres,"" which are made from silicate glass, over 15,000 square meters (3.7 acres) of frozen lake in Alaska. Researchers found that treated ice was thicker and more reflective than untreated ice.

Detractors say that plans to refreeze the Arctic address the symptom, not the cause. Indeed, even if proposals did prove feasible, none would combat the carbon consumption responsible for diminishing sea ice in the first place.

As Julienne Stroeve, a professor at University College London and senior scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, told CNN when the Arizona State University's team first proposed its wind-powered pump concept: ""Global warming in response to rising CO2 concentrations would continue despite efforts to grow ice in the Arctic. Thus, the excess heat at lower latitudes would still be transported towards the Arctic via atmospheric and oceanic circulation and this would counter efforts to grow ice in the Arctic.""

But for Kotahatuhaha and his team, big problems require bold innovation. While he accepts that his iceberg-making submarines are a ""utopian project,"" he wants experts from different fields to help build radical visions into viable solutions.

""Architects cannot build skyscrapers alone,"" he offered as an analogy. ""(They) need collaboration from civil engineers, electrical engineers, economists and others.

""If there are too many limitations, there will be no innovation,"" he added. ""Innovation is the first step to opening (our) way of thinking, then technology and research regarding ... feasibility must be deepened."""

During the Cold War, this plane could fly higher and faster than any other -- and 55 years after its first flight, it still does.

The Lockheed SR-71, designed in secrecy in the late 1950s, was able to cruise near the edge of space and outfly a missile. To this day, it holds the records for the highest altitude in horizontal flight and the fastest speed for a non-rocket powered aircraft.

It was part of a family of spy planes built to venture into enemy territory, without being shot down or even detected, in a time before satellites and drones.

The black paint job, designed to dissipate heat, earned it the nickname Blackbird, and paired with the sleek lines of the long fuselage, made the plane look unlike anything that had come before -- a design that hasn't lost any of its brilliance.

""It still looks like something from the future, even though it was designed back in the 1950s,"" Peter Merlin, an aviation historian and author of "" Design and Development of the Blackbird,"" said in a phone interview.

""Because of the way the fuselage bends and the wing curves and twists, it looks more organic than mechanical. Most conventional airplanes look like someone built them -- this one almost looks like it was grown.""

SR-71 Blackbird: Still the world's fastest aircraft

A CIA spy

In May 1960, an American U-2 spy plane was shot duown in Soviet airspace while taking aerial photographs. Initially, the US government said it was a stray weather research aircraft, but the story fell apart once the Soviet government released photos of the captured pilot and the plane's surveillance equipment.

The incident had immediate diplomatic repercussions for the Cold War and reinforced the need for a new type of reconnaissance plane that could fly faster and higher, safe from anti-aircraft fire. ""The CIA wanted a plane that could fly above 90,000 feet or thereabouts, at high speed and as invisible to radar as it was feasible,"" said Merlin.

The task of designing such an ambitious machine fell on Clarence ""Kelly"" Johnson, one of the world's greatest aircraft designers, and his secret division of engineers at Lockheed, called Skunk Works. ""Everything had to be invented. Everything,"" recalled Johnson, who died in 1990, the same year the Blackbirds were first retired from service.

The original plane in the Blackbird family was called the A-12 and made its maiden flight on April 30, 1962. In total, 13 A-12s were produced, and the plane was a top secret, special access program operated by the CIA.

Titanium skin

Because the aircraft was designed to fly faster than 2,000 mph, friction with the surrounding atmosphere would heat up the fuselage to a point that would melt a conventional airframe. The plane was therefore made of titanium, a metal that was able to withstand high temperatures while also being lighter than steel.

Using titanium presented other problems, however. First, a whole new set of tools -- also made of titanium -- had to be fabricated, because regular steel ones shattered the brittle titanium on contact. Second, sourcing the metal itself proved tricky. ""The USSR was, at the time, the greatest supplier of titanium in the world. The US government had to purchase a lot of that, probably using bogus companies,"" said Merlin.

The initial aircraft were flown completely unpainted, showing a silver titanium skin. They were first painted black in 1964, after the realization that black paint -- which efficiently absorbs and emits heat -- would help lower the temperature of the entire airframe. The ""Blackbird"" was born.

Same plane, different names

The A-12 was soon evolved into a variant that was designed as an interceptor -- a type of fighter aircraft -- rather than a surveillance plane. Effectively, this meant adding air-to-air missiles and a second cockpit, for a crew member to operate the necessary radar equipment. This new plane, which looked identical to the A-12 except for the nose, was called the YF-12.

While the A-12 remained top secret, the existence of the YF-12 was revealed by President Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and three of them were built and operated by the US Air Force. A third variant was produced around this time, called the M-21, which had a pylon on its back for mounting and launching one of the first unmanned drones. Two were built, but the program was halted in 1966 after a drone collided with its mothership, killing one of the pilots.

The final derivative of the A-12, with a twin cockpit and larger fuel capacity, was called the SR-71 -- for ""Strategic Reconnaissance"" -- and first flew on Dec. 22, 1964. This is the version that would go on to perform intelligence missions for the US Air Force for over 30 years, and a total of 32 were built, bringing the final tally for the Blackbird family to 50.

Stealth before stealth

The fuselage of the SR-71 included some of the very first composite materials ever used in an aircraft, which made the plane harder to spot for enemy radar. ""It was essentially stealthy before the word stealth was even used,"" said Merlin.

Flying at a higher altitude than anti-aircraft fire could reach, faster than a missile, and barely visible to radar, the Blackbird could enter hostile airspace practically undisturbed. ""The idea was that by the time the enemy detected it and fired their missile, it was already on its way out,"" Merlin explained. ""But this was before we had real time data links, so they were taking pictures on film and bringing the film back to base to be processed and studied.""

As a result, no Blackbird was ever shot down by enemy fire. However, its reliability was an issue, and 12 out of 32 were lost to accidents. It was also a complicated plane to operate and fly. ""It took an army of people to prepare the aircraft. A Blackbird operational mission essentially had a countdown, like a space mission did, because there was so much preparation involved in both getting the crew ready and the vehicle ready, an unbelievable amount of effort and manpower,"" said Merlin.

The pilots also had to suit up in a special way, due to the extreme conditions found at high altitude. ""They basically wore a space suit, the same sort of thing that you would later see space shuttle crews wearing,"" said Merlin. ""The cockpit also got very hot when flying at high speeds, so much that pilots used to warm up their meal on long missions by pressing it against the glass.""

No Blackbirds were ever flown over Soviet airspace -- something the US government stopped doing entirely after the 1960 incident -- but they still played an important role in the Cold War, and performed missions in other critical theaters such as the Middle East, Vietnam and North Korea.

In 1976, the SR-71 set the records it still holds: flying at a sustained altitude of 85,069 feet, and reaching a top speed of 2,193.2 miles per hour, or Mach 3.3. The program was halted in 1990 -- with a brief revival in the mid-1990s -- once technologies like spy satellites and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles or drones) had become more feasible and offered instant access to surveillance data.

The SR-71 was last flown by NASA in 1999, which used two of the aircraft for high-speed and high-altitude aeronautical research. Since then, the surviving Blackbirds have all found their way into museums."

Amid the glistening waves and youthful grins in Jeff Divine's photos of 1970s surfers, there's something conspicuously absent from the sun-drenched scenes: logos.

This was a time before sponsorship and mainstream attention turned the sport into a lucrative global industry. And the American photographer, a long-time picture editor at two of the scene's bibles, Surfer magazine and Surfer's Journal, was on hand to capture the hedonistic lifestyles and DIY approach of what he dubs the ""pre-commercial"" era.

""It was a time before we were branded -- before the outdoor lifestyle industry clothing brands started giving us free gear,"" he said in a phone interview from his home in California. ""If you look at the photos, there are no backpacks, sunglasses, hats, watches or any of that stuff that's really common now.

Divine's images also capture the friendship and camaraderie of the era's surf scene. Credit: Jeff Divine

""The '70s was a time when the general audience and society -- like your parents, grandparents, or even your brother -- just didn't understand what you were doing. You'd go home and you couldn't describe it.""

This is why, despite having documented the sport extensively for five decades, Divine chose the 1970s as the subject of his new book . In it, he pays homage to the California and Hawaii scenes that he was actively involved in, bringing together more than 130 images from his vast archive.

Some of the collection's most striking photos capture the graceful stillness of surfers hurtling down huge, sculptural waves. The pictures often feature small details that only surfing aficionados will appreciate -- renowned surfing champions, technical moves or ""guys who were our heroes doing maneuvers they were famous for,"" as Divine put it.

But the athleticism on display is evident to all -- and it is reflective of the sport's evolution during this period. The decade's (often garage-made) surfboards were shorter and lighter, which opened up new possibilities for the sport, according to the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist William Finnegan, who contributed an essay to Divine's book.

""Suddenly,"" Finnegan wrote, ""people were turning twice as hard, going twice as fast, and, most transformingly, pulling into heaving barrels that had been unrideable, off-limits, the stuff of idle fantasy until yesterday.""

It was also a time when Divine began taking his craft more seriously. Born in La Jolla, a seaside community in San Diego, he started out by shooting friends and fellow surfers in the mid 1960s. By the time he joined Surfer magazine in 1971 he was heading out onto the water with huge telephoto lenses designed for wildlife photography.

""When I first got my camera, I would surf first and then shoot photos,"" said Divine, who was recently honored with a plaque on the Surfing Walk of Fame at Huntington Beach. ""Then, as I got more professional, by '70 or '71, I would shoot and then surf. By the 1990s and 2000s I just shot.""

Insider's perspective

Being a surfer offered Divine obvious advantages, such as recognizing wave patterns and simply ""knowing what the ocean was doing."" But the photographer's insider status proved especially valuable as he set about documenting the culture -- or subculture -- surrounding the sport.

Photos featured in the book are intended to ""reflect the characters and the people, rather than just men on waves,"" he said. As such, they depict surfers and their friends hanging out, skateboarding, watching waves crash into the beach and loading gear into their cars. In one shot, an unidentified man poses for the camera as he fans out huge bricks of hash, acquired via what Divine described as ""surfer smuggler guys.""

Being part of the very camaraderie that he hoped to capture gave the photographer ""an edge,"" he said.

""I was one of them, and surfers can tell whether you're one of them or not. Outside photographers ... would come into the sport and visit over a week and come back with a whole different take from what someone like me might do. They knew me and trusted me -- it was bit like hanging out with a rock 'n' roll band.

""Everybody wanted to see a picture of themselves on the waves, so they put me on a pedestal because they knew I might get a photo of them and, if they were lucky, they might get in the magazine. It was like being what, in the modern day, you might call an 'influencer.'""

The photos will undoubtedly drip with nostalgia for those who lived through the era, though Divine takes a documentarian's approach to his work. Surfing's subsequent commercialization may have attracted what he reluctantly called ""wannabes"" who were ""attracted to the romance of the sport,"" but the photographer still has plenty of praise for the state of modern surfing.

He described the sport's inclusion in this summer's Olympics Games in Tokyo as an ""incredible thing"" that may inspire a new generation of athletes. And amid the declining sales experienced by many of the world's big surf brands (labels like Quicksilver and Billabong have reported sinking profits in recent years), there appears to be something of a return to the values of old, he said.

Indeed, looking back more than 40 years later, Divine said he sees connections between the '70s surfers and today's -- and he doesn't just mean the tousled haircuts and beards that wouldn't look entirely out of place in 2020s California.

""I think it's so interesting how a lot of young guys now look the same as we looked then,"" he said, pointing to clothing choices in particular. ""The commercial aspect of everything now has made young people want to wear something unique, which is like in the '70s, when you wore something from your travels.

""(Big brands) try and give you that look of being an athlete rebel outdoorsman, but it's commercial, and I think people are now seeking out more unique, boutique-y or 'found' things."""

Mark Neville began shooting semi-staged portraits in the French region of Brittany in a funk at Britain's divisive Brexit referendum. But he emerged somewhere unexpected: a vision of 'ecotopia'.

""This idea of ecotopia underpins all the images -- this kind of search for happiness or utopia, through a relationship with the land and food, and animals -- and suggests that this is the way forward, basically,"" he explained, at the Photographers' Gallery in London.

The British photographer began shooting the series of portraits of local Breton farmers on the day of Britain's decision to leave the European Union, in response to his own feeling of disappointment at the political turn toward border-building. In the next three years, for his project ""Parade,"" he encountered farmers and football fans, Breton dancers and baton twirlers, nuns and dog breeders.

In search of an ideal society, he found a horse-whisperer for abused steeds and a former abattoir worker who has assembled a Noah's ark of abandoned pets and livestock.

Shooting all his subjects in a semi-documentary format, often placing real characters in carefully staged situations, Neville teases out the Bretons' complex, unconventional relationships with animals, as well as strong sense of community with one another. Although he said there is a ""naivety"" in the idea that living closer with animals can be an answer to complex problems of social identity, he hoped to suggest, poetically and often playfully, that it represented a step in one right direction.

""You wouldn't normally see a pig on the bonnet of a car, for example,"" he said of his stylized images. ""But the photos are kind of visual metaphors for the relationships between people and animals.""

Neville is one of four photographers shortlisted for the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize , whose work is on exhibition at the Photographers Gallery until June 7. The winner of the $39,000 (£30,000) prize, whose past awardees include Susan Meiselas and Juergen Teller, will be announced on May 14.

This year's contestants represent the great breadth of art photography, explained curator Anna Dannemann. She groups two of the shortlisted artists, Mohamed Bourouissa and Clare Strand, for their shared focus on how images represent the subjects or instead fail to communicate reality.

Algerian-born Bourouissa draws on art historical influences and mediated low-res phone snaps to show how social conflict marks the suburbs of Paris, while Strand's conceptual experiments create blocky images reminiscent of early dial-up internet graphics.

""The Blue Sky Project"" by Anton Kusters also shares something with Bourouissa: a concern for trauma and grief. He took 1,078 Polaroid images of the a blue sky, shot at the location of every known concentration camp run by the Nazi Party between 1933 and 1945, arranged as a sombre monument on a large plinth in the exhibition.

Neville's own work has consistently straddled the line between documentary and art, creating a perceptible ""contradiction"" or ""tension"" in the images between something real and arranged, he explained.

Pointing to his picture of a baton twirler in front of a back of hunting dogs (see top image), he explains that it took three days to pose satisfactorily, with all the subjects -- human and non-human -- looking down the lens. ""There is a tension that comes from knowing this is a very special, specific moment that I've managed to capture,"" he said.

Neville has often focused on working class communities in England and Scotland, including his acclaimed ""Port Glasgow Book Project,"" in which he spent a year as artist-in-residence documenting the declining shipbuilding community in the town of Port Glasgow in 2004. He also pent two months British soldiers in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, for his 'The Helmand Work' (2010-2011).

The photographer had been in the small town of Guingamp in the rugged Northwest region of France when the shock result of the Brexit referendum was announced.

Although Brittany is part of continental France, it is sometimes called ""Little Britain"" (in contrast to Great Britain), for its historical connections to the people of the UK. For one, the area was named for after settlers who had left the British Isles in large numbers from around 450 AD, while the language of Breton is related to Cornish and Welsh. There, Neville discovered a ""mirror"" of his home country, he said.

There are dystopian aspects present in the work, too. Like other communities Neville has spotlighted, the region has been hit hard by economic decline and the industrialization of farming in the 21st century, with fewer Breton today employed in traditional small-scale farms and fisheries. He says that the photos are a way to show the inhabitants' ""search for community and identity, and... how people realise or manifest their sense of who they are.""

Brittany appears as an in-between place, which can swing as easily toward bucolic utopia as post-industrial dystopia. But in searching for a better society, Neville did find some hope. He tells the story of one subject, Alain, an ethical pig farmer, who lives with his three sons.

""It's just a small, ecological, ethical farm,"" he explained. ""As soon I arrived it felt like home to me, it felt like a kind of paradise. He's got a warmth, and he really cares about the animals.""

Asked what sets his farm apart from the industrialized norm, Alain said: ""When I go into my land, and the pigs hear my voice, they recognize it as me and not someone else. You don't get that with an industrial farm... there's no sense of intimacy or relationship.""

""A rapport between you and the animal, you know, that makes a difference, both in lives of the animals and the lives of the breeders,"" Neville concludes.

""It's quite simple and sounds naive to say, but it's true."""

Every player is orbiting over its landing site. The music stops, the there's a mad dash for somewhere to park.

At any given time -- pre-coronavirus era -- there were usually as many as 20,000 planes swirling around the planet at altitude. The system isn't designed for that amount of planes to be anywhere else apart from in the air -- the only place they generate revenue.

Parking at airports is also pricey. Major European hubs can charge in the region of $285 an hour.

Airlines hit the pause button

Earlier this month, the music stopped abruptly with population lockdowns dominoing across the world. The whine of airplane engines was rapidly muted into an eerie silence.

Some airlines are operating just a skeleton service, and the massive reduction of transatlantic flights in mid-March has kick-started a chain reaction of airplane groundings.

Delta Air Lines has instigated a 70% system-wide pullback, parking at least half of its fleet -- more than 600 aircraft. ""We also will be accelerating retirements of older aircraft like our MD-88/90s and some of our 767s,"" the airline's chief, Ed Bastian, said in a memo to Delta employees.

Australia's Qantas is temporarily grounding 150 airplanes, a mix of A380s, 747s and B787-9s. The carrier says discussions are progressing with airports and the government about parking for these aircraft.

Qantas boss Alan Joyce noted that ""efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus have led to a huge drop in travel demand, the likes of which we've never seen before.""

In Germany, Lufthansa Group is reducing seating capacity on long-haul routes by up to 90%. And for its 29 March to 24 April timetable it announced that a total of 23,000 short, medium and long haul flights were being canceled.

Europe's low-cost carrier Ryanair expects to reduce seat capacity by up to 80% over April and May, and admitted in a company statement that ""a full grounding of the fleet cannot be ruled out.""

With so many major airlines reducing capacity, where will all those planes be stored?

At such a sensitive time, many storage facilities are being justifiably discreet. No one wants to be misconstrued as doing business at the expense of the airlines' misfortunes.

The logistical complexities of where to park thousands of airplanes is made even more complicated by the technicalities required when storing planes.

To ensure they are stored in a way that enables them to return to service in tip-top condition when flights eventually resume, a kind of aeronautical embalming process is required.

This involves draining various fluids, covering the engine intakes and exhaust areas, protecting external instruments like pitot tubes (used for monitoring the airplane's speed during flight), covering windows and tires -- along with other tasks specific to each plane.

Go West

Just north of the Catalina Foothills of Arizona lies Pinal County Airpark, originally set up as a facility in the 1940s for training military pilots. Today the airpark provides a range of storage and heavy maintenance services for wide-body commercial jets.

The airpark has 500 acres suitable for airplane storage, the cost of which depends on a matrix of factors -- how big the plane is, and then what additional ""extras"" the owner/operator wants.

""If the customer wants it kept airworthy and up-to-date with minimal time for reactivation, it runs higher than just storage because there are so many things that the aircraft specifically needs done,"" says Jim Petty, the economic development director for the airpark.

If the aircraft is parked and not managed, the costs are reduced. Generally the airport will lease land to storage companies that then provide the storage services to the ultimate customer.

Petty tells CNN Travel that average rates for monthly parking fees charged in the Southwest area are in a range that is segmented by aircraft weight categories. These span between $56.50 per month for 12,500 lbs -- 24,999 lbs, to $300 per month for between 100,000 lbs - 200,000 lbs.

These, he points out, are the rates charged by the airport for each aircraft and not necessarily the rates charged by the airport storage businesses which are higher, to account for added services.

Why is America's Southwest an attractive destination for airliner storage? One of the main advantages is the arid climate.

""That helps to retard corrosion,"" says Petty. ""Another reason is the relative openness of the region. That's why other airports in the vicinity offer the same services.""

Pinal County Airpark also has tenant businesses that provide one-stop shopping -- they can store aircraft and handle them from landing to departure back into service, and are able to manage and reactivate and perform any type of maintenance on the aircraft.

Borderline decision

It's a busy time at Roswell International Air Center. Mark Bleth/Roswell International Air Center

Over the border in New Mexico, the Roswell International Air Center is in the process of adding 300 more acres of asphalt parking space to its existing 4,000-acre footprint -- enough space to accommodate up to 800 airliners.

""We're working with local companies here at the air center that currently have over 200 planes parked here to reposition and nest aircraft together to maximize available parking areas,"" says Mark Bleth, air center manager and deputy director at Roswell.

Storage prices are set by the City of Roswell's resolution 10-25, with three price ranges depending on size of aircraft. Planes up to 99,000 lbs are charged at $7/day; medium sized aircraft between 99,001 - 200,000 pounds, $10/day; and large airplanes over 200,000 lbs are $14/day.

""This is what we charge our tenants that are accepting these aircraft on behalf of an airline,"" Bleth tells CNN. ""But what they're billing won't be the same because of added services they provide.""

The pricing was set 10 years ago and was scheduled to be updated. However, Bleth emphasizes that, ""We don't want to add any additional costs to the airlines, so we will hold our pricing until the [coronavirus] event is over.""

Runway model

At Copenhagen Airport in Denmark they've come up with a different solution for generating new parking capacity.

Two of the airport's three runways have temporarily been decommissioned and are being used to accommodate airplanes, leaving runway 22L/04R active for all takeoffs and landings.

Dan Meincke, chief of traffic at Copenhagen Airport (CPH) tells CNN that with the current scheme they expect to be able to accommodate about 60 aircraft on the two deactivated runways, in addition to the 80 aircraft that are normally parked at the airport's regular aircraft parking stands.

""Our aircraft storage scheme is designed to allow airlines the greatest flexibility possible for retrieving a single aircraft when it's needed in operation or for maintenance,"" says Meincke. ""This flexibility somewhat reduces the total capacity but if airlines request more parking spots, we can change the scheme dynamically.""

Operating an airport with only one of the three runways serviceable has created somewhat of a challenge, with some extra planes also being parked on the taxiways. So there's a balance to be struck between parking and still maintaining flight operations.

""We don't consider the parked aircraft a problem right now,"" says Meincke. ""In the current situation we will do everything possible to park as many aircraft as possible and we'll negotiate terms on a fluid basis with airlines, but at the moment both short and long-term aircraft parking is an option.""

Currently CPH is running with approximately 58% less takeoffs and landings than usual (figures as of March 19). Yet, while the airport prioritizes resources to assist those airlines that are its regular customers, the airport says it's ready to discuss terms and try its utmost to assist any airline that has a need for aircraft storage in Copenhagen.

A global challenge

The world of aviation storage has to cope with grounded planes from all over the world -- the Asia-Pacific region included.

In Australia, former Deutsche Bank vice president and research analyst Tom Vincent set up a storage facility called Asia Pacific Aircraft Storage (APAS) over a decade ago at Alice Springs. It is in the process of expanding its capacity footprint from the present 30 planes to 70.

""The climatic conditions are ideal for aircraft asset value preservation, with extremely low humidity,"" Vincent tells CNN Travel. ""Storage in high humidity environments such as Asia can have very adverse ramifications on the aircraft, particularly engine and airframe corrosion.""

That could be of interest to airlines specifically located in and around the original epicenter of the coronavirus.

With airlines not knowing how long their planes might remain inactive, Vincent says that customers can choose from a range of storage programs, ""ranging from relatively short-term parking 3 to 6 months, or longer-term programs.""

Final call

The biggest unknown at the moment is how long it will be until travel restrictions are lifted and airlines can start flying again."

The clash of land and water is often mesmerizing, as are the plants, animals and human activities that flourish along a shore.

In classic novella ""Heart of Darkness,"" seafaring author Joseph Conrad wrote that all coasts are shrouded in mystery, with an invitation to ""come and find out"" what they have to offer.

Cinque Terre, Italy

This rugged Italian shore inspired Dante's vision of Purgatory in his poem ""Divine Comedy,"" but to modern visitors, the Cinque Terre is absolute heaven.

Protected within the confines of a national park, as well as a UNESCO World Heritage site, it's made up of a cluster of five coastal villages that really do seem lost in time.

The villages are linked by the famous Sentiero Azzurro, as well as other hiking trails that lead to secluded beaches.

Known as Lycia in ancient times, the big bend along Turkey's southwest shore is one of the lesser known gems of the Mediterranean Sea which flaunts many attractive coastlines.

Its bays really are turquoise, especially otherworldly lagoon Ölüdeniz, or ""Dead Sea,"" near the amazingly photogenic Fethiye.

Sailing is a great way to discover the coast's many secluded bays and coves.

Jonathan , the most beloved resident of St. Helena, a tiny island in the South Atlantic, was born about 1832, five years before the coronation of Queen Victoria. Since then, the giant tortoise has lived through 39 US presidents.

He never met the other notable to live in the island, Napoleon, as the French emperor died in exile there in 1821. The gentle reptilian giant originated from the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean, but made the move to the Atlantic as a gift to the then-governor of St. Helena in 1882.

Since then he's roamed about the governor's grand island estate, where he enjoys the company of three other giant tortoises and frequent human guests.

BLOOMING ROSE: Approximately 1,200 years

Celebrated as the Thousand Year Rose, a towering rose bush in Germany is thought to have been established by King Louis the Pious in 815.

The bush grows alongside a Catholic cathedral dedicated to St. Mary in Hildesheim, a beautiful medieval village noted for its ancient churches.

Besides beauty and age, the plant exhibits remarkable fortitude. Allied bombing during World War II left the cathedral in ruins, but the rose, a Rosa canina, also known as the dog rose, somehow survived, flourished and now grows more than 30 feet high next to the apse of the restored church.

Visit anytime, but late May and early June are the best times to see the delicate pink blossoms.

PLANTED TREE: Approximately 2,300 years

The fig tree under which Siddhartha Gautama experienced enlightenment in India is long gone, but a cutting from it, carried by a royal devotee to Sri Lanka around 250 BCE, give or take a few decades, has grown into one of the most revered trees in the Buddhist world, and the oldest known tree with a planting recorded in history.

Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, Ficus religiosa, has welcomed the religious, the curious and the nefarious in the centuries since.

H.G. Wells marveled at it. Elephants damaged it. Tamil separatists besieged it.

Today, pilgrims of all kinds pay homage, especially on full moon (poya) days, to the tree, which sits among elaborate gardens, canals, golden fences, religious stupas and younger Bodhi trees in the Mahamewna Gardens in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka.

WORKING TREE: Approximately 2,500 years

Whether planted by man or nature, between 2,000 and 3,000 years ago, before the rise of Classical Greece, a seed sprouted on the Mediterranean island of Crete that to this day produces a yearly crop of olives.

But the monumental tree in the village of Vouves does more than make drupe fruit. It and other ancient Olea europaea nearby, similar in wizened age and appearance, attract artists, religious leaders, Olympians and heads of state, inspired by their strikingly gnarly trunks and limbs.

The Vouves tree now features a museum highlighting the traditional olive harvesting techniques of Crete, once the seat of the Minoan civilization, which flourished in antiquity from its olive oil trade.

WILD HERB: Approximately 3,000 years

These eye-catching blobs are Andean shrubs that may date back thousands of years. Shutterstock

The Yareta or llareta, bright green blobs that resemble moss-covered boulders, are actually flowering shrubs perfectly designed to withstand the high-altitude conditions of the Andes Mountains in Peru, Bolivia, northern Chile and western Argentina.

Wind, freezing temperatures and drought prove no match for Azorella compacta, a wild, inedible relative of parsley and fennel, which slowly and methodically ekes out an existence, growing as little as one meter a century.

Because of their slow growth rate, the largest shrubs are thought to be approximately 3,000 years old.

Given their density -- a shrub can easily support the weight of a human -- Yareta have been used like peat as a traditional fuel. Fortunately, South American governments have rallied to protect the endangered species.

SINGLE TREE: Approximately 5,000 years

Methuselah, a bristlecone pine in the White Mountains of California, stands at the ripe old age of about 5,000, making it the oldest known non-cloned organism on Earth.

The volcano sponges of Antarctica, Anoxycalyx joubini, are whitish blobs that resemble giant beer barrels or miniature volcanoes. They pepper the chilly waters around McMurdo Sound and their estimated age is based on the sheer size of the sponges, which only grow a tiny bit each year.

They thrive in depths from 50 to 500 feet, sentinels of a deep realm they share with other strange creatures, like tiny crustaceans and wiggly worms that live inside the sponges, and packs of pin-cushioned sea stars that dine on the two-meter-tall monsters.

Only the most dedicated scuba divers can explore this realm. Thanks to extreme ocean outfitters such as Polar Trec , they can -- enjoying, after drilling through the ice, some of the best underwater visibility in the world.

LAND FOREST: Approximately 80,000 years

The Trembling Giant of Utah consists of almost 50,000 quaking aspen trees, but the entire grove of Populus tremuloides is genetically identical and shares a single root system, making it technically a single organism.

Mount Everest is a whopping 29,035 feet above sea level. Michael Tomordy

MOUNT EVEREST

Elevation: 29,035 feet

Location: Nepal/Tibet border

There's no customs booth on the summit of Mount Everest -- the highest mountain on Earth -- where a frontier straddles Nepal and Tibet. So what's with all the crazy lines on this cramped, gale-plumed, oxygen-starved peak?

The ultimate magnet for big ticket bucket-listers vying for a shot at standing on top of the world during a narrow climbing window in late spring, Everest is all business these days. The fabled peak attracts more puffy-suited high-fivers than ever to its increasingly doable but dicey slopes -- and about as many divergent references, depending on your angle.

Nepalis call their famous hill Sagarmatha (""Sky Head""), Tibetans know it as Chomolungma (""Mother of the World""), while geologists lump Everest (named after legendary 19th-century British land surveyor George Everest) in the youth category.

Roughly 50 million years old -- a toddler in big mountain time -- it's the largest fold of Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates in the Himalayan range, with plenty of growing room left (about a quarter inch a year).

Ever since it was first scaled in 1953, Everest has remained a crowning achievement among snowballing legions of climbers. Recently, the mythical mountain has also been described as the ""world's highest garbage dump"" (of abandoned climbing detritus) and a ""zoo"" of Death Zone queues waiting for summit selfies at airplane altitudes.

During an especially busy and lethal 2019 climbing season, the mountain has claimed at least 11 lives.

Reach for the top: Climbers typically reserve at least 45 days (including pre-ascent preparations, a long tromp to base camp, and crucial acclimatization periods on the mountain before an average four-to-five-day summit push) and an ante of anywhere from $40,000 to over $100,000 for a spot on a commercial expedition.

From the Nepal side, the Southeast Ridge is by far the most popular passage to the summit, among nearly 20 other climbing routes at present. Last year, over 800 climbers and support guides reached the top -- a new record.

Marvel from below: Barring a long bus ride, the most chilling part of the suggested two-week roundtrip trek to Everest Base Camp is a quick flight from Kathmandu to a harrowingly short mountain airstrip in Lukla. From there, the 40-mile ascent past mountain villages, Buddhist monasteries and bell-clanging yak traffic to the 17,600-foot-high base of the world's highest peak is often shortlisted as one of the world's greatest hikes. And a great place to smile and turn around.

Alternative alp (for Himalayan realists): 20,285-foot Imja Tse (commonly known as Island Peak) holds the unofficial distinction of being one of the most climbable ""trekking peaks"" (basic mountaineering skills and gear still necessary) in the Everest region -- with bonus views of neighboring giants Mounts Lhotse, Nuptse, Makalu and Ama Dablam.

MOUNT DENALI

Elevation: 20,310 feet

Location: South Central Alaska

North America's highest peak (formerly named Mount McKinley) may max out at an elevation barely above Himalayan low camps, but never mind all that. Few bits of tectonically bent granite are as impossibly enormous as Mount Denali, which rears nearly three-and-a-half vertical miles up above its relatively low 2,000-foot starting point.

From base to summit, that's over a mile taller than Everest.

The crown of the 600-mile-long Alaska Range is big enough to create its own weather patterns. Like, for example, 150 mph winds and -93°F on an especially brutal day.

Scientists say Mount Denali is still on the rise -- at a steady-ish rate of about half a millimeter per year. So check back in a mere four million years from now and the ultimate Bob Ross mountain may be about a mile higher.

The vast majority of climbers attempt to reach the summit via the popular West Buttress route, which can see as many as 600 people on it at any given time during peak season between late May and early June.

AFRICA

MOUNT KILIMANJARO

Elevation: 19,340 feet

Location: Northern Tanzania

Even for a lone cone as spectacular as this jumbo geological marvel plunked in the East African plains, how does even the coolest-looking, -sounding, -residing mountain retain its rightful mystique once the annual climber rate surpasses the 50,000 mark?

Probably just by being Kilimanjaro -- the world's tallest freestanding peak, a dormant (but still simmering) volcano, and a not-so-microcosmic world unto itself.

Meandering through numerous ecological zones (tropical rain forest, heath, moorland, alpine desert, etc.) from savanna to snowcapped summit, hardy climbers here might be fooled into thinking they're tromping across half the planet. But that would be too easy.

Reach for the top: A non-technical ""walk up"" climb with several established routes to choose from, Kilimanjaro is far too susceptible to being minimized as a multi-day hike. Reality check: Less than 30% of climbers manage to complete the entire journey on the most popular 5-day Marangu ""Coca-Cola"" Route plan, according to local guide service Ultimate Kilimanjaro.

A better bet: Losing the hasty crowds and adding a few extra days of acclimation on one of the longer, slower, undulating routes to combat altitude sickness -- the main reason hikers bow out here.

Dry season (late June to October) is the preferable time to tackle Kilimanjaro, with September being the prime climbing month. Permits are essential to enter the park, and all climbers must use a guide and porters.

Marvel from below: Summit fever aside, don't forget where you are -- in prime African safari territory. Making time to see the Big Five and other amazing creatures in nearby Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater is a rivaling high point during any Kilimanjaro climbing expedition. Many guide services can build these visits into the itinerary.

Alternative alp (for road-less-taken types): Mount Kenya (17,057 feet). Far from the Kili crowds and less than 100 miles from Nairobi, Africa's almost-famous, second-highest mountain occupies its own national park -- frequented by savvy African peak baggers seeking a quieter, cheaper and reputedly an even more picturesque climbing experience.

There's literal mythical status on the dormant volcanic slopes of Elbrus -- where Zeus reportedly chained Prometheus's arms as punishment for stealing fire from the gods.

Those flames have long been extinguished on an enormous icy mound adorned with over twenty glaciers, deep verdant valleys and raging rivers below. Plus a steady circuit of adventure-seekers arriving with crampons, skis and hiking poles.

Reach for the top: During summer climbing season, the most popular passage to the summit of Elbrus' west peak (the higher of the two) is along the Standard Route via the mountain's south face, where a cable car can take climbers as high as 12,500 feet.

From here, the ascent often takes between six to nine hours (descent about three hours) during a long and strenuous but technically undemanding climb that's best done with an experienced guide and after at least a week of proper altitude acclimation.

Currently, a US Travel Advisory warning is in effect for the North Caucasus region, which includes Mount Elbrus.

MOUNT ACONCAGUA

Elevation: 22,841 feet

Location: Western Argentina

The highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres with a base camp that claims to be the second busiest in the world after Everest, Mount Aconcagua was in an earlier life an active volcano on the edge of a shallow dinosaur-era sea.

Today, this subducted Argentinean peak's glaciated slopes are an arid 150 miles from the nearest ocean, a stone's throw from the Chilean border, and the prize ambition of every semi-sensible summit seeker leaving K2 for some other lifetime.

Reach for the top: Most climbers opt for the non-technical northern ""Normal Route"" during peak climbing season from mid-December to the end of January.

Cheaper and easier to scale than its distant Himalayan cousins, Aconcagua might be perilously confused for an ""Everyone's Everest."" According to Mountain IQ, at least 60% of the mountain's estimated 4,000 annual climbers do not reach the summit -- and many are completely unprepared for the challenge.

Aconcagua reputedly holds South America's highest mountaineering fatality rate (about three deaths per year) plus numerous casualties of hypoxia and frostbite due to brutal weather at unforgiving elevations.

Marvel from below: Entry permits for Aconcagua Provincial Park must be obtained in person from the tourism office in Mendoza, 70 miles east of the mountain. The good news: this puts you smack in the middle of prime Argentina wine country.

Alternative alp (for Andean overachievers): Ojos del Salado (22,615 feet). About 400 miles north of Mount Aconcagua, perched on the same jagged spine dividing Argentina and Chile, is the continent's second tallest peak. A popular non-technical climbing site on the edge of the Atacama Desert, Ojos del Salado also holds the distinction of being the world's highest active strato-volcano and (fun fact) home to the highest point ever reached by a 4x4 vehicle.

MOUNT KOSCIUSZKO

Elevation: 7,310 feet

Location: Southeastern New South Wales

If there's one comfortingly moderate exception to Australia's status as a ""land of extremes,"" it would be in the Seven Summits category, home to the lowest and most user-friendly of the bunch.

Tucked in its namesake national park in the Snowy Mountains, Mount Kosciuszko manages to be both the highest point in mainland Australia and a pleasant walkabout in nice weather with a convenient chairlift to help move things along.

A revised Seven Summits list has technically replaced this mountain with a higher Oceanic peak (see ""alternative alp"" below) sharing the same broader continent. But Kosciuszko remains a classic version favorite for moderates and diehard fans of the 19th-century Polish-Lithuanian military leader for which the peak is oddly named.

Reach for the top: From the ski resort village of Thredbo, start with a scenic warm-up ride on the Kosciuszko Express Chairlift to the Kosciuszko Walk trailhead, where a four-mile hike past herbfields, alpine lakes and gradual inclines leads to the summit. Expect company during antipodean summers, when the mountain receives about 100,000 visitors.

Marvel from below: Mountain drives in Australia don't get more dramatic than the winding roads of Snowy Mountains country. For close-ups of the highest peak, Alpine Way Drive provides a sufficiently steep and narrow 67-mile road trip between Thredbo and Khancoban in Kosciuszko National Park.

Alternative alp (for continental plate nerds): If Australia and Oceania (as purists point out) are joined at the plate, then the Seven Summits title instead goes to the crest of Puncak Jaya (16,024 feet) -- a.k.a. Carstensz Pyramid -- hiding in Indonesia's Papua province. A rare glaciated peak in the tropics, it's also considered one of most technically tough mountains to climb on this list.

MOUNT VINSON

Elevation: 16,050 feet

Location: 600 miles from the South Pole

The final frontier as far as Seven Summits go, Mount Vinson is about as close as a hump of ice-caked rock can get to a galaxy far, far away.

Simply recognizing the continent's highest point -- tucked on a plateau of peaks in West Antarctica's Sentinel Range of the Ellsworth Mountains -- was a milestone.

Vinson was the last of the Seven Summits to be successfully climbed (in 1966), and it would take years before another expedition made it back to repeat the feat. Over 1,200 climbers have since made it to the top, led by a handful of specialized commercial guides.

There's a joke that simply getting to this mountain (four-hour cargo plane commute from Punta Arenas, Chile, to Union Glacier snow camp with a 50-minute Twin Otter hop to Vinson Base Camp) is the hardest part of the climb. But it's just a joke.

So what's an intrepid amateur explorer with a thirst for all things rare and superlative to do?

Travel in the opposite direction, of course, to Challenger Deep. Sitting at a depth of 10,928 meters (35,853 feet), it's widely believed to be the deepest point in the world's oceans.

In a world-first, travel company EYOS Expeditions has teamed with private undersea diving company Caladan Oceanic to offer general members of the public an opportunity to join an upcoming expedition and dive to the bottom of the Marianas Trench in the western Pacific Ocean.

How rare is this experience? According to EYOS, only seven people on earth have visited Challenger Deep. (Hollywood director James Cameron just happens to be one of them.)

Here's the catch: The company is only inviting three people to join the trip. Staff tell CNN Travel it's being offered on a first-come, first-serve basis. The cost?

US$750,000.

Four hours on the sea floor

The three travelers, called ""Mission Specialists,"" will spend approximately eight days with the Ring of Fire Expedition, which is operated by EYOS and Caladan Oceanic.

Each submarine dive will take up to 14 hours. The descent, which is over seven miles, takes over four hours. The divers will spend up to four hours on the seafloor, where they will get to explore and potentially film their surroundings.

""This is the most exclusive destination on Earth,"" says Rob McCallum, founding partner of EYOS Expeditions, in a statement.

""Currently, only three manned expeditions have ever been made to the bottom of Challenger Deep and more people have been to the moon than to the bottom of the ocean.""

The Mission Specialists will board the hadal exploration vessel, DSSV Pressure Drop, in June 2020 -- EYOS says the exact date is to be confirmed -- in Agat, Guam. It then takes a day at sea to reach the Marianas Trench.

The expedition will use Caladan Oceanic's submersible, Limiting Factor, which has been pressure tested in a chamber to 14,000 meters and has already dived five times to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. EYOS says it's the only vehicle ever constructed that is capable of multiple dives to full ocean depth.

""The occupants of the submersible are completely protected by the 90mm thick titanium sphere and experience no pressure changes or physiological stresses at all,"" says the statement announcing the trip.

Comfy seats, hi-def cameras

As a result, no formal pre-departure training is required, though Mission Specialists will receive a comprehensive shipboard and sub orientation as part of pre-dive preparations.

""The inside of the sub is quiet, peaceful and very relaxing. The sub has two comfortable seats, three view ports, and high-definition 'surround' cameras,"" says McCallum.

""Whilst onboard, Mission Specialists will be fully integrated members of the team and free to work alongside our sonar operator/ocean mappers, submersible technicians, film production team, expedition management and ship's officers to gain an insight into the complexities and challenges of hadal exploration,"" he says.

Don't worry. Even intrepid explorers need some down-time, too. McCallum says when not diving, expedition members can relax by taking in a movie, going to the gym, reading, or heading up to the ""Sky Bar"" for a sundowner.

The dive is part of a much longer six-month Ring of Fire expedition EYOS and Caladan Oceanic are operating, a followup to the Five Deeps Expedition made last year, which visited cavernous chasms in the Pacific, Indian, Southern, Arctic and Atlantic oceans over a period of 10 months.

""Its collective mission is to verify and test the deepest points possible, collect and analyze scientific samples, and extend humankind's knowledge of the most extreme environment on Earth, says Ben Lyons, EYOS Expeditions' CEO."

""She started asking me a lot of questions and I just tried to explain to her that sometimes people aren't as fortunate and that we need to try to be kind and give when we can,"" Karina Hardee, Katelynn's mom, told CNN.

So Katelynn decided to set up a stand on December 8, spending her Sunday selling hot cocoa, cider, and cookies. Katelynn and her mom donated the $80 collected, which went towards paying off the negative lunch balances of over 100 students at her elementary school.

By doing this, the youngster hopes that other students ""can have a snack and lunch. If they don't, their tummies grumble,"" Katelynn said, according to her mom.

PARIS (Reuters) – The French government has drawn up a list of companies that may need state support due to the coronavirus outbreak such as a capital injection or even outright nationalization, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday.

Le Maire said he could not disclose the names of the companies on the list, but that they knew they could count on the support of the government.

“Nationalization is obviously a last resort, but it is something that we do not exclude,” Le Maire told France Info radio.

“We are not going to let our industrial champions that we have invested billions in … go up in smoke because of an economic crisis of a violence unseen since 1929,” he said.

Some French companies in which the state holds a stake have suffered steep drops in their share prices due to the outbreak, with carmaker Renault <RENA.PA> and airline Air France KLM <AIRF.PA> among those to see the most dramatic drops.

Le Maire urged big companies to show “moderation” about paying dividends to their shareholders and also to pay their suppliers strictly on time. Those who fail to do so will not be able to get a state guarantee for their loans, he said.

The government has offered to guarantee up to 300 billion euros ($325 billion) in business loans through commercial banks as part of its response to the economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus outbreak.

It has also launched a package of crisis measures worth 45 billion euros – 2% of GDP – in the form of deferred tax payments and payroll charges as well as payments to companies that keep workers on their payroll even if they are not working.

Le Maire said that companies had requested such payments to cover 720,000 workers.

A survey published on Tuesday showed that French business activity plunged to its lowest level on record in March as a nationwide coronavirus lockdown shuttered vast swathes of the euro zone’s second-biggest economy.

MUNICH (Reuters) – German sportswear company Puma <PUMG.DE> announced on Tuesday that 1,400 staff would switch to shorter work hours until April 13 as sales slump due to the coronavirus and said its three top executives would not take their pay for April.

Germany allows companies to apply for state aid to keep people working but switch to shorter hours.

A Puma spokeswoman said almost all the shops that Puma and its partners operate had been closed due to the coronavirus.

Employees at the company’s headquarters in the southern German town of Herzogenaurach and in its own stores will now work only half of their usual hours, but will still be paid their full salary due to the short-time work allowance.

Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden, finance chief Michael Laemmermann and sourcing chief Anne-Laure Descours will waive their April salaries, together worth about 170,000 euros ($183,821.00), while the next management level will waive a quarter of their salary.

The three executives were paid a total of 2 million euros in 2019.

Puma said earlier this month it was abandoning the 2020 guidance it gave on Feb. 19 that had assumed the crisis would be short-lived.

LONDON (Reuters) – Euro zone business activity has crumbled in March as the coronavirus pandemic sweeping across Europe and the world wreaks havoc and shops, restaurants and offices pull down the shutters, a survey showed on Tuesday.

IHS Markit’s Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, plummeted to a record low of 31.4 this month from February’s 51.6, by far its biggest one-month fall since the survey began in mid-1998.

That reading was below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which had a median prediction of 38.8.

“Business activity across the euro zone collapsed in March to an extent far exceeding that seen even at the height of the global financial crisis,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.

“Steep downturns were seen in France, Germany and across the rest of the euro area as governments took increasingly tough measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus.”

All subindexes in the survey came in under the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, with new business hit particularly hard – that index sank to a record low of 29.5 from 51.2.

“The March PMI is indicative of GDP slumping at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and clearly there’s scope for the downturn to intensify further,” Williamson said.

Activity in the bloc’s dominant services industry contracted at the steepest rate in the survey’s more than two-decade history. Its PMI nose-dived to 28.4 from 52.6, below all forecasts in the Reuters poll.

Firms turned to cutting prices for the first time in over three years and optimism tumbled to a survey low. The business expectations index stood at 34.8 compared with last month’s 61.3.

Factories were less badly impacted, with the manufacturing PMI dropping to 44.8 from 49.2 – its lowest since July 2012 but above expectations in the Reuters poll for 39.0.

An index measuring output which feeds in to the composite PMI dropped to 39.5 from 48.7, a level not seen since April 2009.

Factories across the single-currency bloc cut staff, reduced raw material stocks and completed backlogs of work as demand tanked. The new orders index was 38.2 compared with 49.4 last month, a near 11-year low.

OSLO (Reuters) – Norwegian Air <NWC.OL> has secured an initial cash infusion of 300 million Norwegian crowns ($26.6 million) from a government rescue package for the airline industry, the budget carrier said on Tuesday.

Norway said on March 19 that Norwegian Air could obtain credit guarantees worth up to 3 billion crowns to help it weather the coronavirus crisis subject to a series of conditions.

Norwegian, which has grounded most of its aircraft and temporarily laid off 90% of staff, amounting to about 7,300 people, had said it needed access to cash “within weeks, not months”.

A condition for receiving the first 300 million crowns from Norway’s rescue package was that commercial lenders were willing to supply 10% of that amount while the government would provide the remaining 90%.

“Norwegian is pleased to announce that two Nordic banks have obtained credit committee approval to provide a guarantee for the required 10%,” a company statement said.

“Norwegian will secure the necessary headroom to pursue further guarantees from the Norwegian government.”

Norwegian’s shares rose following the announcement, trading up almost 5% at 9.36 Norwegian crowns ($0.87) at 0852 GMT.

On Monday, leasing company DP Aircraft <DPAD.L> said a unit of Norwegian Air had failed to make payments relating to two Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft in its fleet, which had been due on March 13.

DP Aircraft and its asset manager, DS Aviation, will prioritize discussions with Norwegian “in order to determine whether and on what basis it may be able to meet its obligations,” DP said.

Norwegian did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

FURTHER FUNDS

The airline is now working with state credit agency GIEK and Norway’s trade and industry ministry to clarify the criteria and terms for receiving the remaining tranches of the scheme, it said.

A tranche of 1.2 billion crowns is dependent on creditors postponing installments and scrapping interest payments for as long as the guarantee lasts.

Another of 1.5 billion crowns would require Norwegian to boost its equity, the government has said.

The company said it is now seeking further guarantees from financial institutions to help it access these tranches.

“The government guarantee scheme is crucial for the company as the current state of the capital markets in combination with the challenging times for the airline industry limit the options available,” Norwegian said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) – Hong Kong said on Monday it was stopping all tourist arrivals and transit passengers at its airport and was considering suspending the sale of alcohol in some venues, joining cities around the world in the battle to halt the coronavirus.

Announcing tough new travel restrictions, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the government was planning to curb the sale of alcohol at more than 8,000 bars and restaurants, an extraordinary move in a city that never sleeps.

An emotional Lam said many people took off their masks in bars and “even have intimate acts when they are tipsy”, increasing the risk of cross-infection.

“So, we are going to suggest, as it requires legislative work, around 8,600 restaurants, bars and clubs with liquor licenses to temporarily suspend the sale of alcohol by amending the law,” Lam, who was wearing a face mask, told a news conference.

“We are investigating any further measures we can do rather than a complete closure of restaurants as we know many Hong Kong residents do not cook at home and often dine out.”

Alcohol will be available in supermarkets and convenience stores across the city.

The city government announced 39 new cases of coronavirus on Monday, 30 of which had a recent travel history, bringing its total to 357. Four people have died of the disease in Hong Kong.

The measures come two days after the government warned a spike in the number of people returning to the region infected with coronavirus could lead to a large community outbreak.

The ban on tourist arrivals would last for 14 days from Wednesday, with visitors from mainland China, Macau and Taiwan who had travelled elsewhere recently, also subject to the restriction.

Late on Sunday, Hong Kong said it was investigating 41 instances of people violating quarantine, including five people who could face prosecution. Two had removed or cut off electronic wristbands used to track people, the government said.

Hong Kong last week began using the electronic wristbands linked to an app as part of its effort to enforce quarantine.

BISHKEK (Reuters) – Kyrgyzstan declared a state of emergency on Tuesday in its three biggest cities, including the capital Bishkek, locking them down and imposing a curfew after the number of coronavirus cases in the Central Asian nation more than doubled.

In addition to the cities of Bishkek, Osh and Jalal-Abad, local emergencies were also declared in three provincial districts, the government said.

Residents of the affected areas were instructed to only leave their homes for urgent necessities.

In Bishkek in particular, the measures will include a 2000-0700 curfew, city commandant and deputy interior minister Alik Orozaliyev told an online briefing.

The Central Asian nation bordering China said on Tuesday it has confirmed 42 cases of coronavirus infection, up from just 16 a day earlier.

Also on Tuesday, the Kyrgyz government ordered all of its employees to start working from home.

Boris Johnson has outlined strict new measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus, including a ban on public gatherings of more than two people.

He said people should leave home only to exercise once a day, travel to and from work where ""absolutely necessary"", shop for essential items and to fulfil any medical or care needs.

He also ordered the immediate closure of shops selling non-essential goods.

But police said they had received lots of calls asking what was still allowed.

As of Monday, some 335 people have died with the virus in the UK.

'National emergency'

Speaking from Downing Street on Monday, the prime minister said the country faced a ""moment of national emergency"" and staying at home was necessary to protect the NHS, save lives and tackle ""the biggest threat this country has faced for decades"".

Police and local authorities will have powers to disperse gatherings, including through fines.

The restrictions would be under constant review and a relaxation of the rules would be considered in three weeks, he said.

""To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well,"" he said.

The prime minister's spokesman said many ministers would dial into Tuesday's cabinet meeting remotely, to comply with social distancing measures.

The new measures came amid fears people were disregarding the government's social distancing advice.

At the weekend, crowds of people were seen at beaches, parks, markets and other public spaces.

The new guidance says people should only leave their homes for one of four reasons:

Shopping for basic necessities such as food and medicine. Shopping trips should be as infrequent as possible

One form of exercise a day such as a run, walk or cycle. This should be done alone or only with people you live with

Any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person. This includes moving children under the age of 18 between their parents' homes, where applicable. Key workers or those with children identified as vulnerable can continue to take their children to school

Travelling to and from work, but only where work absolutely cannot be done from home

Even when following the above guidance, people should minimise the amount of time spent out of their homes and should keep two metres (6ft) away from people they do not live with.

The government is also stopping all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies - but funerals attended by immediate family members are allowed.

Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said if people did not follow the rules, the police would ""have the tools to ensure they are penalised and punished if they put others' lives at risk"".

These measures represent some of the most far-reaching curbs on personal freedom ever introduced in the UK in peacetime.

But it is unclear how the rules can be made to work.

The first hurdle is to get them on to the statute book; although the prime minister said the restrictions on travel and gatherings would come into effect immediately, police don't have the powers to enforce them yet, nor have they had official guidance.

The second issue - assuming legal regulations are approved later this week - is the practical difficulty of getting groups to disperse and accurately identifying people who should not be on the streets, without losing public goodwill and sparking disorder.

When efforts to persuade those who do not comply have failed, officers will be able to issue fines, with prosecutions likely to be a last resort.

But at a time when officer numbers are increasingly depleted through illness and self-isolation, forces will be hoping communities do the right thing without the need for intervention.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption After Boris Johnson brings in new measures, the BBC explains why staying in is a matter of life and death

Businesses that will not need to close include supermarkets, petrol stations, post offices, launderettes, bike shops, pet shops, hardware stores and banks.

Mr Gove said construction should continue on site so long as social-distancing measures were followed.

But premises such as libraries, non-essential shops, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship have been ordered to close.

Hotels, hostels, campsites and caravan parks must also close unless key workers need to stay there, or if other people staying there cannot return to their primary residence.

Parks will remain open for exercise but people are not allowed to gather in groups.

Community centres can stay open but only for the purpose of ""hosting essential voluntary or public services"" such as food banks or service for homeless people, the guidance says.

Prisoners in England and Wales will be confined to their cells for 23 hours a day and allowed out only to shower and use pay-phones, with all visits cancelled, the BBC understands.

Some 83,945 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus with 6,650 testing positive. However, the true number of cases will be far higher as tests are primarily done on hospital patients with symptoms of the virus.

It seems hard to overstate how huge an impact this will have on the country, and what a massive decision this is for the government to have taken - whose effect will last at least for a period of three weeks at the shortest, potentially for very much longer.

Remember this though is not quite the kind of total crackdown we have seen in other countries - at least not yet.

Not surprisingly, there is already therefore enormous controversy about whether the UK has been acting fast enough.

'Real challenge'

But there were calls for more information about the guidance after the prime minister scrapped his daily press conference on Monday to announce the measures in a statement.

Lincolnshire Police warned of an ""extremely high volume"" of calls and Humberside Chief Constable Lee Freeman said his force had received ""a number of calls"" on the subject, which he said he was unable to answer.

Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said enforcing the new restrictions would be ""a real, real challenge"", as there was already ""large amounts of sickness"" among officers across London.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said in a tweet that the next few weeks would be ""testing"" for police but she would make sure officers had ""the resources they need to keep themselves and the public safe"".

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the measures were ""the right response"" but called for more guidance on workplace closures.

""The government must close the loopholes to give security to all workers, including the self-employed, as well as renters and mortgage holders,"" he said.

The prime minister said he knew the ""damage"" the restrictions were causing to people's lives, businesses and jobs - and said ""many lives will sadly be lost"" despite the measures.

But he added there was ""a clear way through"", by strengthening the NHS with former clinicians returning to work, accelerating the search for treatments and a vaccine and buying millions of testing kits.

Sports Direct has performed a U-turn on keeping its shops open during the coronavirus lockdown following a backlash over its plans.

The government has ordered all UK shops selling non-essential goods to close.

Sports Direct initially said it would remain open as it was ""uniquely well placed to help keep the UK as fit and healthy as possible"".

But after widespread criticism, it now says it will not open ""until we are given the go-ahead by the government"".

The chain is now contacting the government ""at all levels"" to confirm whether its shops are deemed to provide an essential service, Chief Financial Officer Chris Wootton said.

Michael Gove led the charge against Sports Direct on Tuesday morning, saying he couldn't see ""any justification"" for it to stay open.

""The key thing we need to do is make sure people wherever possible stay at home. Yes it's important people exercise but that should be done once a day and it's a basic thing,"" the Cabinet Office Minister said.

""People can walk, run or cycle, they should, but there is no reason for a store like Sports Direct to remain open.""

It had argued that it provided an essential service. Bosses at the company said the sports equipment it sells can be used to exercise at home at a time when gyms have been closed.

In a letter written by Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct and Evans Cycles, finance chief Chris Wootton had said: ""Thus our Sports Direct and Evans Cycles stores will remain open where possible to allow us to do this (in accordance with the government's current social distancing guidance).""

""There is no one else that has the range of product and range of stores to make this reasonably accessible for the whole population.""

Bicycle shops are on the list of retailers that are allowed to stay open during the shutdown.

The move had been questioned by Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the trade union Usdaw, which represents shop workers in the UK.

He told the BBC's Today programme: ""I can't see how it [Sports Direct] is an essential service. It's a sports clothing company.

""In my mind, an essential service would include food and medicine and the supply chain around that,"" as well as the National Health Service, he said.

Sports Direct's decision to stay open despite the new government restrictions also saw a backlash on social media.

Ian Lavery MP, chair of the Labour Party, told the company's founder Mike Ashley to ""take some responsibility"".

Which retailers will close?

A number of High Street retailers and food chains, such as Ikea, John Lewis and Next, had already shut prior to Mr Johnson's announcement on Monday evening, leaving tens of thousands of people temporarily without work.

Others such as WH Smith and B&Q had previously vowed to stay open while adhering to stricter social distancing policies.

Mr Johnson said: ""I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people's lives, to their businesses and to their jobs.

""And that's why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business.""

Retailers that will be allowed to stay open include:

Supermarkets and other food shops

Pharmacies

Petrol stations

Newsagents

Bicycle shops

Home and hardware stores

Laundrettes and dry cleaners

Garages

Pet shops

Post Offices

Banks

Businesses will still be able to take online orders and deliver items to people's homes.

The government this week said it would pay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic, in a move aimed at protecting people's jobs.

It will pay 80% of salary for staff who are kept on by their employer, covering wages of up to £2,500 a month.

Many retail and hospitality firms have warned the pandemic could see them collapse, wiping out thousands of jobs, as life in the UK is put on hold.

Helen Dickinson, chief executive of retail lobby group the British Retail Consortium, said many shops had already closed temporarily.

""Others have continued to provide essential products and services to their customers, both from physical stores and online.

""Any retailers that remain open will be following the very latest government public health guidance to ensure they do everything they can to ensure the safety of customers and staff.""

The government had already ordered pubs, restaurants and cafes to close amid concerns that people were ignoring its advice to keep social contact to a minimum.

Monday night's announcement came as the number of UK deaths from coronavirus hit 335, while there were 6,650 confirmed cases.

Many of the big brands to have already announced closures have promised to pay their staff for several weeks until the government's coronavirus job retention scheme kicks in.

However, concern is growing about the millions of self-employed and gig economy workers who will be forced to rely on benefits in the absence of targeted support.

Neil Carberry, boss of lobby group the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said the announcement reinforced the need for businesses and workers to access government support measures ""as quickly as possible"".

""With the economy and jobs market in lockdown, all employers can do is stand by their staff as far as possible and reap the benefits during the post-crisis comeback,"" he added."

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the coronavirus disease pandemic is ""accelerating"", with more than 300,000 cases now confirmed.

It took 67 days from the first reported of Covid-19 to reach 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000, and just four days for the third 100,000.

But WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was still possible to ""change the trajectory"".

He urged countries to adopt rigorous testing and contact-tracing strategies.

""What matters most is what we do. You can't win a football game by defending. You have to attack as well,"" he told a joint news conference with Fifa president Gianni Infantino to launch a ""kick out coronavirus"" campaign featuring footballers.

Dr Tedros said asking people to stay at home and other physical-distancing measures were an important way of slowing down the spread of the virus, but described them as ""defensive measures that will not help us to win"".

""To win, we need to attack the virus with aggressive and targeted tactics - testing every suspected case, isolating and caring for every confirmed case, and chasing and quarantining every close contact.""

Dr Tedros expressed alarm at reports from around the world of large numbers of infections among health workers, which appeared to be the result of a shortage of adequate personal protective equipment.

""Health workers can only do their jobs effectively when they can do their jobs safely,"" he warned. ""Even if we do everything else right, if we don't prioritise protecting health workers many people will die because the health worker who could have saved their life is sick.""

He said the WHO has been working with its partners to rationalise and prioritise the use of protective equipment, and to address the global shortage of it.

But he noted: ""Measures put in place to slow the spread of the virus may have unintended consequences of exacerbating shortages of essential protective gear and the materials needed to make them.""

The WHO chief called for ""political commitment and political co-ordination at the global level"" and said he would ask leaders of the G20 group of nations this week to work together to boost production of protective equipment, avoid export bans and ensure equity of distribution on the basis of need.

Europe's battle against virus intensifies

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday night that, with immediate effect, ""people will only be allowed to leave their home...for very limited purposes"". They include shopping for basic necessities, taking one form of exercise per day, fulfilling any medical need, or travelling to work if working from home is impossible.

The number of people who have died in the UK rose to 335 on Monday.

In Italy, the worst-hit country in the world, the authorities said 602 people with Covid-19 had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll there to 6,077.

But the daily increase was the smallest since Thursday, raising hope that the stringent restrictions imposed by the government were starting to have an effect.

Spain, however, said its death toll had risen by 462 to 2,182 - a 27% increase.

Meanwhile, International Olympic Committee member Dick Pound said the 2020 Tokyo Olympics would be postponed by one year because of coronavirus. However, the IOC has not yet formally announced a decision on the future of the Games.

The IOC has given itself four weeks to decide on the future of the games, but Australia and Canada have said they will not compete in Japan this summer and Great Britain has said it is unlikely that it would be able to send a team.

So, what is the disease, how does it spread and when are people most infectious?

How do I protect myself?

The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water.

Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth.

So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important for limiting the spread.

Face masks do not provide effective protection, according to medical experts.

What are the coronavirus symptoms?

Coronavirus infects the lungs. The symptoms start with a fever followed by a dry cough, which can lead to breathing problems.

This is a new, continuous cough and means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or having three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual).

It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, scientists have said, but some people will get symptoms much later than this. In fact the World Health Organization (WHO) says the incubation period lasts up to 14 days.

People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but there have been suggestions some can spread the virus even before they are sick.

The early symptoms can easily be confused with other winter bugs including colds and flu.

What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

How deadly is coronavirus?

The proportion dying from the disease appears low (between 1% and 2%) - but the figures are unreliable.

Thousands are being treated but may go on to die - so the death rate could be higher. But it may also be lower if lots of mild cases are unreported.

A World Health Organization examination of data from 56,000 patients suggests:

6% become critically ill - lung failure, septic shock, organ failure and risk of death

14% develop severe symptoms - difficulty breathing and shortness of breath

80% develop mild symptoms - fever and cough and some may have pneumonia

Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. The data from China also suggests that men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women.

Treatment relies on keeping the patient's body going, including breathing support, until their immune system can fight off the virus. Work to develop a vaccine is under way.

What should I do if I think I have coronavirus?

Patients with mild symptoms - such as a new continuous cough or a high temperature above 37.8C should self-isolate at home for at least seven days, according to the latest advice issued by Public Health England.

People are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E.

Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP.

If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate. Advice for people who have travelled back to the UK from affected areas and who may need to self-isolate, has been issued.

Other countries have introduced their own measures For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people showing symptoms to call their healthcare provider, and those who are mildly ill to self-isolate.

The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public.

Who gets tested and how does it work?

In its latest advice, Public Health England (PHE) has said those who are self-isolating with mild symptoms will not be tested.

However, all hospital patients with flu-like symptoms will be tested.

If you need testing in the UK results may be available on the same day, but you may be asked to stay at home and self-isolate. while you wait.

How fast is it spreading?

Tens of thousands of new cases are being reported worldwide each day. However, it is thought health agencies may be unaware of many cases.

After starting in China, coronavirus is now spreading fast in many other countries.

It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 cases and just four days for the third 100,000 cases.

Spanish soldiers helping to fight the coronavirus pandemic have found elderly patients in retirement homes abandoned and, in some cases, dead in their beds, the defence ministry has said.

Spanish prosecutors said an investigation had been launched.

The military has been brought in to help disinfect care homes in Spain, one of Europe's worst hit countries.

Meanwhile, an ice rink in Madrid is to be used as a temporary mortuary for Covid-19 victims, officials said.

On Monday Spain recorded its highest daily death toll - 462 - bringing the total to 2,182.

Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles told the private TV channel Telecinco that the government was ""going to be strict and inflexible when dealing with the way older people are treated"" in retirement homes.

""The army, during certain visits, found some older people completely abandoned, sometimes even dead in their beds,"" she said.

The defence ministry said that staff at some care homes had left after the coronavirus was detected.

Health officials have said that in normal circumstances the bodies of deceased residents are put in cold storage until they are collected by the funeral services.

But when the cause of death is suspected to be linked to coronavirus they are left in their beds until they can be retrieved by properly equipped funeral staff. In the capital Madrid, which has seen the highest number of cases and deaths, that could take up to 24 hours, officials said.

Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa told a news conference that retirement homes were ""an absolute priority for the government"".

""We will exercise the most intensive monitoring of these centres,"" she added.

As the crisis in Madrid worsened, the city's municipal funeral home said it would stop the collection of Covid-19 victims from Tuesday because of a lack of protective equipment.

The city is to use a major ice rink, the Palacio de Hielo (Ice Palace), as a temporary mortuary where bodies will be stored until funeral homes can collect them, officials told Spanish media.

Spain is the second worst affected country in Europe after Italy, which now has the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world.

Italian authorities said on Monday that 602 people with Covid-19 had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 6,077.

US President Donald Trump - under fire for labelling Covid-19 the ""Chinese virus"" - has said Asian Americans should not be blamed for the outbreak.

He said it is ""very important that we totally protect"" Asian Americans, whom he praised as ""amazing people"".

Mr Trump spoke out amid rising reports of verbal and physical attacks on the community amid the pandemic.

Coronavirus is still spreading in the US, which currently has more than 43,000 confirmed cases and 533 deaths.

At a White House coronavirus task force news conference on Monday, Mr Trump said: ""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world.

""They're amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form.

""They're working closely with us to get rid of it - we will prevail together.""

Asked by a reporter why he had spoken out, Mr Trump said: ""It seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country and I don't like that at all.

""These are incredible people, they love our country and I'm not going to let it happen.""

During press conferences last week, Mr Trump used the term ""China virus"" and ""Chinese virus"", rejecting suggestions from reporters that the term was racist.

""It comes from China,"" Mr Trump said then. ""It's not racist at all.""

The World Health Organization has issued guidance against ""stigmatising certain communities"" when naming illnesses.

US lawmaker Judy Chu - a California Democrat and chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus - was not impressed by Mr Trump's remarks.

She told NBC News his comments would not ""be necessary if he and his supporters had not already endangered so many by spreading this toxic xenophobia"".

From 'Chinese virus' to 'amazing people'

Analysis by Zhaoyin Feng, BBC News Chinese, Washington

In describing Covid-19 as the ""Chinese virus"", Mr Trump has been accused of attempting to deflect scrutiny for his domestic handling of the crisis on to external factors.

Despite mounting criticism from China and Asian Americans, the president and several high-ranking US officials have continued to use the term.

Other than potentially stigmatising Asian-Americans, Mr Trump's ""Chinese virus"" label could turn out to be a self-inflicted wound in the 2020 presidential election.

Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial group in the US. According to recent surveys, the community's voters have increasingly leaned Democratic in the past few years, and they are becoming influential in electoral battleground districts.

Even as he lavished praise on Asian Americans on Monday, the president was accused of breaking fences, rather than mending them.

""They [Asian Americans] are working closely with us to get rid of it [virus],"" he tweeted, leading some observers to take offence at the ""they/us"" dichotomy.

What's the latest in the US?

On the day that Britain announced a national lockdown to combat the virus, Mr Trump announced: ""America will again and soon be open for business.""

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo appeared to suggest the president was putting the country's economic well-being ahead of its public health, tweeting: ""You cannot put a value on human life.""

The US is currently in the middle of 15 days of social distancing. Despite the president's signal that he was inclined to ease restrictions, state by state the nation was tightening lockdown measures.

On Monday, Washington, Ohio, Louisiana, Oregon, Michigan, Indiana and Massachusetts became the latest to issue ""stay at home"" orders for residents.

Wisconsin, Delaware and New Mexico will follow suit on Tuesday, taking the total number of states withdrawing behind closed doors to well over a dozen.

These orders will affect about one in three Americans - more than 100 million people.

Maryland stopped short on Monday of a ""stay at home"" order, instead joining several other states that have closed all non-essential businesses.

Neighbouring Virginia closed schools for the rest of the academic year.

The US now has the third highest number of cases in the world, behind Italy and China.

Half of America's total caseload is in New York state, which has recorded more than 20,000 positive tests and 157 deaths.

A private healthcare clinic in London has defended its decision to charge £375 ($434) for a coronavirus test.

The Private Harley Street Clinic said the price reflected ""the costs of these logistic and clinical services that we provide"" and added that it was offering free tests for NHS staff.

It followed newspaper reports that the clinic had sold several thousand at full price.

According to its website, the test is no longer available.

In a statement released on Monday, the clinic said it was ""pausing"" the service now that the UK government has committed to carrying out more tests nationwide, with a commitment to carrying out 25,000 tests a day within four weeks.

Chief executive Dr Mark Ali did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.

It is believed the test offered was made by a firm called Randox Health, which was selling them online for £120 each, although according to its website it is currently out of stock.

Randox Health was also contacted by the BBC.

'Exploiting vulnerability'

Public Health England currently does not advise buying home tests. It says there is not yet enough information about them.

""It is not known whether either a positive or negative result is reliable"", reads a statement on its website.

A spokesman for the General Medical Council said: ""We expect doctors to be clear about the safety and accuracy of Covid-19 tests, and not to offer or recommend tests that are unproven, clinically unverified and/or otherwise unreliable.""

Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the needs of NHS staff and patients should be ""put over making profit from the situation"".

What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

Ad ban

The Private Harley Street Clinic said it had never advertised its service.

Google told the BBC that while it did not have a specific rule about ads for coronavirus tests, it had placed the pandemic under its ""sensitive events policy"", which means ads are banned which ""may capitalise on tragic events such as a natural disaster, conflict or death"".

Facebook said that test kit ads were banned.

Cheap tests

Australian firm Rapidward, usually a sustainable energy firm, said that five days ago it began supplying Covid-19 blood tests direct from China to Switzerland, Italy and Iran at a cost of $12 each, including shipping.

The test, which detects antibodies, claims to have 93.4% accuracy, although it has not yet been approved by the official bodies in the US or UK.

The firm said it would not sell to individuals.

""The kits are simple enough to be used by individuals, but we want to supply the medical industry and healthcare sector,"" said founder Milton Zhou.

Mr Zhou added that he believed it was ""outrageous"" to charge more than the cost price.

Academics at Leicester University are developing a mask-based test that could cost just £2 per unit, it said.

Major car plants in the US, Europe and Asia have halted production to try to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. But they are still pledging to help make ventilators and other vital medical equipment.

US President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday: ""Ford, General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products, FAST! Go for it auto execs, let's see how good you are?""

It came after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it had reduced barriers in the medical device approval process to help speed up the production of ventilators.

""Medical device makers can more easily make changes to existing products, such as changes to suppliers or materials, to help address current manufacturing limitations or supply shortages,"" US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.

""Other manufacturers, such as auto makers, can more easily repurpose production lines to help increase supply.""

However, some experts have warned that carmakers may not find it easy to switch production.

Jens Hallek, head of ventilator manufacturer Hamilton Medical, told Wired the materials and the components needed to build a ventilatorare ""highly specific"" and require ""specialised know-how"".

""These are extremely sensitive machines with not only a lot of hardware, but also a lot of software. If one of the components does not work correctly, the whole machine shuts down and cannot be used any more,"" he said.

Former US Defense Department officialstold the Washington Post that it could take more than a yearfor carmakers or aerospace factories to start making ventilators.

Meanwhile, Tesla boss Elon Musk said he had bought 1,255 ventilators from China and had them shipped to Los Angeles.

'Fully focused'

Last week, Formula 1 teams in the UK said they hoped to find ""a tangible outcome in the next few days"" to help increase the supply of medical equipment. Working with the government and health authorities, F1 said it had experts in design, technology and production capabilities who could help out.

Nissan is part of a consortium, including sports car firm McLaren and aerospace company Meggitt, looking to develop a new medical ventilator. ""We are fully focused on the project,"" McLaren said in a statement, but warned of the ""limited time and scale of the challenge"".

Indian billionaire Anand Mahindra said his company, The Mahindra Group, would begin work immediately to explore how its factories could make ventilators. The conglomerate is the world's largest tractor maker and India's biggest electric vehicle manufacturer, according its its website."

The government has passed all stages of their 329-page emergency bill through the House of Commons.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the emergency legislation will allow ""extraordinary measures"" never seen in peace time in the UK.

The bill will go before the House of Lords on Tuesday.

What does the legislation include?

The bill gives the government wide-ranging powers, unlike any other recent legislation.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has stressed that the powers in the bill would only be used ""when strictly necessary"" and would remain in force only for as long as required to respond to the crisis.

Workforce

Speaking in the Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said 7,563 recently retired clinicians had so far ""answered the call"" to return to work to help with the emergency.

He told MPs that the returnees included nurses, midwives, paramedics and social workers - adding that priority would be given to ensure their training was up to date and they were fully insured.

Easing pressure

There are multiple sections aimed at reducing the pressure on other frontline sectors, for example by relaxing rules around detention under mental health laws and increasing the use of audio and video links in courts.

This category of measures shows just how wide the subject matters range.

Organisations could be required to provide space or resources for the storage or management of dead bodies, while rules relating to investigatory powers will be relaxed while the law is in force.

Limiting contact

One of the more high-profile measures in the bill is the power to restrict events and shut down premises such as pubs.

If UK and devolved ministers decide an event or venue poses a threat to public health, the owner of a venue or an organiser of the event can be forced to cancel, close down or restrict access.

Failure to do so could result in a fine.

Controlling borders

Once the bill passes, officials will have the power to close the borders in the event that the Border Force is under intense pressure due to staffing shortages.

It also puts into law powers to isolate or detain individuals who are judged to be a risk to containing the spread of Covid-19.

Sick pay

Since the outbreak of coronavirus, there has been pressure on the government to support workers who are unable to work during the crisis.

To support businesses, the bill will allow employers to reclaim statutory sick pay funds from HMRC to help with the burden of increased staff absence. For workers, it will scrap the three-day waiting period so that they can receive the payments from the day they stop working.

Are MPs concerned about the bill?

Following pressure from Tory MPs, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the bill would be debated and voted on every six months to ensure Parliament was ""content with its continuation"".

Acknowledging the ""difficult"" powers being sought by ministers were ""unprecedented in peacetime"", he insisted they would be ""relinquished"" as soon as the threat to the UK had passed.

A succession of Conservative MPs welcomed the move but sought assurances that the measures would only apply to fighting the virus.

Tom Tugendhat expressed concern that the powers could - in different circumstances - be used in a ""malicious fashion"".

David Davis sought reassurances that individual elements of the bill could be removed if they were not working as intended while Steve Baker called for a sunset clause - when the bill would automatically expire - of one rather than two years.

Will anything be changed?

Labour's shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said no MPs ""came into this House"" to give powers of this kind to the executive, ""curtailing some of the basic freedoms our forebears fought for and we take for granted"".

While Labour believed unprecedented measures were now needed to ""save lives and protect our communities"", he said the measures would ""chill every Liberal in the House"" and it only offered its support with a ""heavy heart"".

However, he said the bill required careful scrutiny to ensure the ""quite extraordinary"" powers were not abused, particularly in changes to rules on mental health sectioning and the provision of social care.

The bill, he warned, would give councils the power to ""downgrade"" care for the disabled and the elderly and that this should be subject to a review by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission.

While councils should be able to prioritise those with the greatest needs in the event of staff shortages, ""what no-one of us wants to see is the legal minimum of support become the default"".

When will it all come in to force?

Any legislation has to pass to the House of Lords once it has cleared the Commons. The government has no majority on the red benches, so peers could cause some problems if they want to make changes to the bill.

If they do, this would probably happen on Wednesday, at report stage. It would then return to MPs on Thursday.

Either way, it should be signed into law by the end of Thursday, giving ministers powers that would be unprecedented in normal times."

The father of a 20-year-old who was killed by a man she met after a night out says his daughter was unfairly shamed by her killer's defence.

Chloe Miazek died at a flat in Aberdeen in November 2017 after she was strangled by Mark Bruce.

Speaking out for the first time, her father Bob rejects the claim that his daughter and Bruce had a ""shared interest"" in asphyxiation during sex.

He says it was later admitted by Bruce that the pair never even discussed it.

In fact, the court was told that Bruce had accepted, when sentencing reports were being prepared after his conviction, he did not have the consent of his victim to use strangulation during sex.

The death of Chloe Miazek was recently echoed in the case of British backpacker Grace Millane who was strangled by a man she met on a Tinder date in New Zealand.

Both Ms Millane and Ms Miazek were unable to defend themselves from claims that their deaths were ""kinky sex games"" gone wrong.

Ms Miazek's father says his daughter was just an ordinary young girl on a night out who was killed by a man she had just met.

Image caption Mark Bruce pleaded guilty to culpable homicide

Her killer was originally charged with murder but Bruce pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of culpable homicide and was sentenced to six years.

When he was convicted at the High Court in Aberdeen in March 2018, there was an ""agreed narrative"" between the Crown prosecutors and the defence over what happened that night.

The court was told how Ms Miazek was ejected from a nightclub and met Bruce, who had also been drinking, at a bus stop in the early hours.

They went back to Bruce's flat and the CCTV footage of Ms Miazek entering the building is the last time she was seen alive.

Through his tears, Ms Miazek's father told BBC Disclosure how the family felt sidelined by the legal process and how his daughter's reputation was trashed without her being able to defend herself.

Mr Miazek thinks personal remarks about his daughter's private life were used to reduce the culpability of Bruce.

Image caption Bob Miazek says his daughter Chloe was just an ordinary Scottish girl

The killer's defence lawyer told the judge that Ms Miazek had ""somewhat lost her way"" and was ""experimenting...with drink, drugs and sexual practices"", a claim her father rejects.

The defence lawyer also referenced a statement taken from a previous partner of Ms Miazek that outlined ""erotic sexual asphyxiation was something she was interested in"", although the couple never practised it.

The lawyer told the judge that Bruce could not recall the specifics of what happened on the night Ms Miazek died but he said that it seemed they had ""a shared interest in that particular practice"".

The statements in court still haunt Bob Miazek and his wife Theresa.

""They used quite a long time to implicate Chloe,"" Bob says. ""And that was when all the headlines hit the tabloids. We had to sit through that and listen to that about our little girl.""

The Daily Record ran with ""strangled to death in kinky sex romp"" while The Scottish Sun and Daily Mail both referenced a fatal ""sex game"".

Mr Miazek rejects the suggestion that his daughter consented to the fatal violence inflicted by Mark Bruce.

He questions how someone who has strangled a person to death is allowed to say the victim consented without any proof.

The BBC can reveal that the sentencing in April 2018 calls the defence's original claims into question.

After reading out sections of Mark Bruce's ""Criminal Justice Social Work Report"", his defence lawyer stated that Bruce had told the authors of the report ""there was no conversation between himself and Ms Miazek about violence during sex, there was no discussion and that at no point would she have expected such"".

The lawyer added: ""In particular, Mr Bruce has stated in this report, or it is recorded in this report, that he accepts that he did not have the consent of the victim to use strangulation during sex.""

Mr Miazek recalls hearing this statement in court. ""We stood up and we're like…'this means murder',"" he says.

The same report that stated Chloe did not give consent also referenced that Bruce had previously choked a partner during sex.

Image caption Chloe Miazek had only just met Mark Bruce

Although Bruce swiftly took responsibility for Chloe's death, Mr Miazek questions why more was not made of his failure to call for help.

Three hours after Ms Miazek was last seen alive, Bruce left the flat but it took more than an hour before he handed himself into a local police station, confessing that he had killed her.

""Our opinion was he didn't report it anywhere near [early] enough. He should have reported it when it happened,"" Mr Miazek says.

""He should've done something, not just leave her,"" he added.

Mr Miazek says what happened has had a ripple effect through the whole family.

He says that Chloe's death and the aftermath of it is still affecting ""brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews"" and that he doesn't know how long is it going to take for the pain to subside.

""The law should actually help people that are the victims,"" he says.

Alex Salmond has been cleared of sexually assaulting nine women while he was Scotland's first minister.

A jury found the former SNP leader not guilty on 12 of the sexual assault charges facing him, while another was found not proven.

A further charge of sexually assaulting a 10th woman had previously been dropped by prosecutors.

Mr Salmond had said he was innocent of all the charges against him throughout the two-week trial.

The women who made the allegations against Mr Salmond included an SNP politician, a party worker and several current and former Scottish government civil servants and officials.

During his evidence to the court, he said the claims made about his alleged conduct were ""deliberate fabrications for a political purpose"" or ""exaggerations"".

And he said he had ""never attempted to have non-consensual sexual relations with anyone in my entire life"".

Mr Salmond's defence team had claimed during the trial that a senior Scottish government official known as Woman A, who was one of his accusers, had contacted some of the other complainers before Mr Salmond was charged.

Defence lawyer Gordon Jackson QC told the jury: ""That stinks. It absolutely stinks"".

Mr Jackson also said his client had not always behaved well and could have been ""a better man on occasions"" - but had never sexually assaulted anyone.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alex Salmond with his defence lawyer Gordon Jackson QC

Speaking outside court after his acquittal, Mr Salmond said: ""As many of you will know, there is certain evidence I would have liked to have seen led in this trial but for a variety of reasons we were not able to do so.

""At some point, that information, that facts and that evidence will see the light of day.""

He also said his faith in the Scottish legal system had been ""much reinforced"", and thanked his legal team and everyone else who had supported him.

Mr Salmond added: ""Whatever nightmare I have been through over the last two years it is as nothing compared to the situation we are all going through.

""If you can, go home, take care of your families, God help us all.""

After a political career crossing four decades, Alex Salmond has spent more time than most sitting nervously waiting for a result to come in. Never, though, one quite like this.

As the foreman of the jury read out verdicts clearing the former first minister of sexual assault, it was like the air had gone out of the room. After six total hours of pacing and speculation, the inhabitants of court three were utterly silenced.

For two weeks, Mr Salmond had sat placidly in the dock as his future and freedom were debated in front of him. Giving evidence, there was little evidence of the political showman of old - this was a reserved Alex Salmond, acutely aware of the difficulty of the situation facing him.

Outside the court too, there was little in the way of triumphalism. He thanked the jury and his supporters, and voiced fears about the coronavirus crisis.

But he also spoke about how ""certain evidence"" was yet to come to light.

This underlines that while the court case is over, there are many matters which are far from settled.

There will now be myriad questions directed at the Scottish government, the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon.

But these will be debated in the political arena, not the legal one.

Nicola Sturgeon, who replaced Mr Salmond as first minister and SNP leader in 2014, told BBC Scotland that the jury's verdict must be respected and that she will welcome the parliamentary inquiries that are to be held into her government's handling of the allegations against Mr Salmond.

She added: ""I am a strong believer in a rigorous, robust independent judicial process where complaints of this nature, if they come forward, are properly and thoroughly investigated, due process takes its course and a court reaches a decision.

""I have no doubt that there will be further discussion around this issue in due course, and I will welcome that, but that time is not now.

""This country faces a crisis right now that is bigger than anything we've ever faced before, and as first minister my duty to the public is to focus 100% on steering us through that crisis - and that is what I intend to do.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nicola Sturgeon: ""Jury's verdict must be respected"".

The Scottish government admitted during a judicial review in January of last year that it had acted unlawfully while investigating sexual harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond by appointing an investigating officer who had ""prior involvement"" in the case.

Mr Salmond, who hosts a TV show on controversial Russian broadcaster RT, was arrested by the police and formally charged later the same month.

He resigned from the SNP in August 2018, but made clear at the time that he intended to apply to rejoin the party that he led for a total of 20 years once he had cleared his name.

Mr Salmond remains an iconic figure for many within the party and the wider independence movement, and raised more than £100,000 in just three days from an online crowdfunder to pay for his judicial review against the Scottish government.

The jury's verdict was welcomed by SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC, who said that there were now ""serious questions about the background to these cases"".

Ms Cherry added: ""Some of the evidence that has come to light both in the judicial review and at this trial raise very serious questions over the process that was employed within the Scottish government to investigate the alleged complaints against Mr Salmond.

""I am sorry to say some of the evidence also raises serious question marks over how these complaints were handled by the SNP.""

Another SNP MP, Kenny MacAskill, tweeted that he was ""delighted"" for Mr Salmond, before adding: ""Some resignations now required.""

Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw said: ""This remains a national political scandal with profound questions of integrity for the first minister and her SNP government.""

But he said everyone's efforts must be focused, for now, on tackling the coronavirus crisis.

What did the jury decide?

The jury returned not guilty verdicts on 12 of the sexual assault charges, including one of attempted rape, and returned a not proven verdict on a charge of sexual assault with intent to rape.

The not proven verdict is an unusual and highly controversial feature of the Scottish legal system which in practice is exactly the same as a verdict of not guilty.

The charges were all alleged to have happened while Mr Salmond was serving as Scotland's first minister, with several alleged to have happened at the first minister's official Bute House residence in Edinburgh.

Mr Salmond was first minister between May 2007 and November 2014, when he stood down in the wake of the Scottish independence referendum and was replaced by Nicola Sturgeon.

Amazon is teaming up with researchers funded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to pick up and deliver coronavirus test kits.

The Gates Foundation-backed Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) is learning how the infection spreads.

It involves collecting nasal swabs to track the virus among residents of Seattle's King County in Washington.

Amazon Care, the retail giant's employee medical care arm, is now helping with deliveries of the kits.

King County is one of the places hardest hit by the outbreak in the US.

SCAN, a group of medical, public health and research organisations, is trying to find out how the infection is spreading in different parts of society, with an aim to seeing how the outbreak is likely to develop.

Amazon Care will assist the work by delivering test kits to people's homes and then picking them up for researchers.

If the virus is detected, the participant will then be put in touch with healthcare workers.

“We are grateful to be surrounded by a strong community of public health, global health and academic leaders and are eager to leverage Amazon Care’s infrastructure and logistics capabilities to support this local effort,” an Amazon spokesman said.

The partnership could help improve coronavirus testing in the US as it lags behind other countries in getting people checked for the virus.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday reported 33,453 cases of coronavirus in the country. That's an increase of 18,185 cases from its previous count, while the death toll almost doubled to 400.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation along with research charity Wellcome and Mastercard's Impact Charity have committed $125m (£107m) in funding to develop treatments for the coronavirus.

Earlier this month, Mr Gates announced he was stepping down from Microsoft's board to focus on his philanthropic efforts."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a series of new restrictions to fight the coronavirus outbreak in a televised address from 10 Downing Street.

What are the new measures?

The prime minister said:

Shops selling ""non-essential goods"" including clothes and electronics stores will be closed immediately

Libraries, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship will also close

Gatherings of more than two people (excluding people who live together) will be banned

There will be no weddings or baptisms but funerals will be allowed

Parks will remain open but people are only to go out to exercise once a day

Mr Johnson said that if these rules are not followed then police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

People are also being told not to meet friends or family members who do not live with them.

Mr Johnson said people would only be allowed to leave their homes in future for specific and limited purposes:

Shopping for ""basic necessities"", as infrequently as possible. People should use delivery services, where they can

Medical reasons, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person

Travelling to and from work, but only if it is ""absolutely necessary""

The measures will last for three weeks from 23 March before being reviewed.

Why are tougher restrictions being introduced?

The government had already told people that to prevent the spread of coronavirus they should only go out when necessary - for example, to buy food and medicine, or for exercise.

When out, people have been told to keep at least 2m (6ft) apart from other people. This is known as social distancing.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Clapham Common in London was among the parks across the UK busy over the weekend

However, since this advice was issued, there have been many examples of people not following it.

At the weekend, parks and open spaces were packed with people. Snowdonia National Park, for example, said it had experienced the ""busiest ever visitor day in living memory"".

And with the reduction in train services across the UK and tube trains on the London Underground, passengers on their way to work were crowded together on Monday.

What has the UK already done?

People had already been urged to work from home where possible, and not to visit pubs, restaurants, cafes, theatres and other venues.

Last Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that these places should all close, although takeaways could still offer a service.

Schools also shut on Friday, although some have been kept open to provide a service for the children of key workers, such as NHS staff.

Why do people need to stay apart?

Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, and then touch your face with unwashed hands.

How does the UK compare to other countries?

Many countries have already imposed severe restrictions on their populations."

The UK government has introduced strict new measures to try and slow the spread of coronavirus. But what does the virus mean for your health? And what are the chances of you catching it?

Here are the answers to ten of the most common readers' questions.

If you recover from coronavirus, are you immune? - RubyRed on Twitter.

It is too soon to tell. This virus has only been around since the end of December, but from experience with other viruses and coronaviruses, you should have antibodies to the virus which will protect you.

With Sars and other coronaviruses we tended not to see reinfection. Now there are some reports from China of people who are released from hospital subsequently testing positive.

The key thing was that those people were no longer infectious.

What is the incubation period for the coronavirus? - Gillian Gibs

It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, scientists have said, but some people will get symptoms much later than this.

The incubation period lasts up to 14 days, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days.

Knowing and understanding the incubation period is very important. It allows doctors and health authorities to introduce more effective ways of controlling the spread of the virus.

How long are you ill for? - Nita, Maidstone

For four out of five people Covid-19 will be a mild disease, a bit like flu.

Symptoms include a fever and a dry cough. You may feel under the weather for a few days but you should be back to normal within a week or so of symptoms appearing.

If the virus gets well established in the lungs, it can cause breathing difficulties and pneumonia. About one in seven people may need hospital treatment.

How dangerous is coronavirus for people who have asthma? - Lesley-Anne, Falkirk

The government says some people with severe asthma could be ""extremely vulnerable"" to the virus. That's because when people with asthma get respiratory infections, such as coronavirus, it can set off their asthma symptoms.

More than a million people most at risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus - including some people with severe asthma - have now been asked to stay at home for at least 12 weeks. They should have received a letter from the NHS.

If you think you are extremely vulnerable but have not had a letter or been contacted by your doctor, you should discuss your concerns with your GP or hospital clinician.

Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your preventer inhaler (usually brown) daily, as prescribed. This will help cut your risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus.

Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service.

Are otherwise healthy disabled people more at risk from coronavirus? - Abigail Ireland, Stockport

Coronavirus can be more severe in older people and those with pre-existing conditions. These include heart and lung illnesses, and diabetes.

There is no evidence that disabled people who are otherwise healthy - and who don't, for instance, have respiratory problems - are at greater risk of dying from, or with, coronavirus.

Ask me

Should I wear a mask to protect myself and others from the virus? - Ann Hardman, Radcliffe, Manchester

Although doctors and surgeons often wear face masks, there is little evidence that wearing face masks by the public makes a difference.

Public Health England has said they ""do not recommend the use of face masks as a means of protection from coronavirus"". They say there is very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use, outside of clinical settings,

Can you catch the virus from food prepared by an infected individual? - Sean McIntyre, Brisbane, Australia

Someone infected with coronavirus could potentially pass it on to someone else, if the food they prepare has not been handled hygienically. Coronavirus can be spread by cough droplets on hands. Washing your hands before touching and eating food is good advice for anyone, to stop the spread of germs.

Can coronavirus be transmitted by door handles, other surfaces and money? - Jean Jimenez, Panama

If someone infected with the virus coughs on their hand and then touches something, that surface may become contaminated. Door handles are a good example of a surface that might pose a risk.

It's not yet known how long the new coronavirus might be able to live on such surfaces. Experts suspect it is hours rather than days, but there are differences of opinion.

It is best to wash your hands regularly to help reduce the risk of infection and the spread of the virus.

The Chinese government has said that cash received by all banks must be sterilised before being released to customers, in order to reduce the spread of the disease.

Using contactless cards can minimise the risk of handling cash. However, these cards can also harbour germs and viruses.

Best practice is to wash your hands thoroughly after handling cards, coins or banknotes.

Can the coronavirus be transferred through items posted to the UK from abroad? - Stefan

There is no evidence that this is a risk. Some diseases, including coronavirus, can spread through surfaces contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them, but it is thought that the virus does not survive for long.

Something sent in the post is unlikely to be contaminated by the time it arrives at its destination.

How do you get gas and electricity if you are on a prepayment meter and can't get to a Post Office to top it up? - David E P Dennis, via Twitter

The energy companies have promised to help you if you have a prepayment meter. So you may be able to authorise a friend to top up your energy card for you.

You could also ask your supplier to send you a card by post, which is already topped up. The government says that if it's urgent, the supplier should be able to add credit directly to your account.

You need to ring the company and talk it through. The new scheme has only just been announced so we will have to see how well it works. You should be able to top-up online as well.

The world is shutting down. Places that were once teeming with the hustle and bustle of daily life have become ghost-towns with massive restrictions put on our lives - from lockdowns and school closures to travel restrictions and bans on mass gatherings.

It is an unparalleled global response to a disease. But when will it end and when will we be able to get on with our lives?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he believes the UK can ""turn the tide"" against the outbreak within the next 12 weeks and the country can ""send coronavirus packing"".

But even if the number of cases starts to fall in the next three months, then we will still be far from the end.

It can take a long time for the tide to go out - possibly years.

It is clear the current strategy of shutting down large parts of society is not sustainable in the long-term. The social and economic damage would be catastrophic.

What countries need is an ""exit strategy"" - a way of lifting the restrictions and getting back to normal.

But the coronavirus is not going to disappear.

If you lift the restrictions that are holding the virus back, then cases will inevitably soar.

""We do have a big problem in what the exit strategy is and how we get out of this,"" says Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh.

""It's not just the UK, no country has an exit strategy.""

It is a massive scientific and societal challenge.

There are essentially three ways out of this mess.

vaccination

enough people develop immunity through infection

or permanently change our behaviour/society

Each of these routes would reduce the ability of the virus to spread.

Vaccines - at least 12-18 months away

A vaccine should give someone immunity so they do not become sick if they are exposed.

Immunise enough people, about 60% of the population, and the virus cannot cause outbreaks - the concept known as herd immunity.

The first person was given an experimental vaccine in the US this week after researchers were allowed to skip the usual rules of performing animal tests first.

Vaccine research is taking place at unprecedented speed, but there is no guarantee it will be successful and will require immunisation on a global scale.

The best guess is a vaccine could still be 12 to 18-months away if everything goes smoothly. That is a long time to wait when facing unprecedented social restrictions during peacetime.

""Waiting for a vaccine should not be honoured with the name 'strategy', that is not a strategy,"" Prof Woolhouse told the BBC.

Natural immunity - at least two years away

The UK's short-term strategy is to drive down cases as much as possible to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed - when you run out of intensive care beds then deaths spike.

Once cases are suppressed, it may allow some measures to be lifted for a while - until cases rise and another round of restrictions are needed.

When this might be is uncertain. The UK's chief scientific advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, said ""putting absolute timelines on things is not possible"".

Doing this could, unintentionally, lead to herd immunity as more and more people were infected.

But this could take years to build up, according to Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London: ""We're talking about suppressing transmission at a level whereby, hopefully, only a very small fraction of the country will be infected.

""So eventually, if we continued this for two-plus years, maybe a sufficient fraction of the country at that point might have been infected to give some degree of community protection.""

But there is a question mark over whether this immunity will last. Other coronaviruses, which cause common cold symptoms, lead to a very weak immune response and people can catch the same bug multiple times in their lifetime.

Alternatives - no clear endpoint

""The third option is permanent changes in our behaviour that allow us to keep transmission rates low,"" Prof Woolhouse said.

This could include keeping some of the measures that have been put in place. Or introducing rigorous testing and isolation of patients to try to stay on top of any outbreaks.

""We did early detection and contact tracing the first time round and it didn't work,"" Prof Woolhouse adds.

Developing drugs that can successfully treat a Covid-19 infection could aid the other strategies too.

They could be used as soon as people show symptoms in a process called ""transmission control"" to stop them passing it onto others.

Or to treat patients in hospital to make the disease less deadly and reduce pressures on intensive care. This would allow countries to cope with more cases before needing to reintroduce lockdowns.

Increasing the number of intensive care beds would have a similar effect by increasing the capacity to cope with larger outbreaks.

I asked the UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, what his exit strategy was.

He told me: ""Long term, clearly a vaccine is one way out of this and we all hope that will happen as quickly as possible.""

And that ""globally, science will come up with solutions"".

""It's been non-stop for the past few weeks. No matter how hard we try, the shelves aren't full.""

There are many people around the country who have been following the government's advice around social distancing - that's avoiding going out for non-essential reasons due to the coronavirus pandemic.

For quite a few of us, that means having to work from home.

But that's not an option everyone can take. Supermarket worker Tiff has no choice but to go to work, despite the infection risks.

""In an ideal world, supermarkets would close too, but I know that's not possible right now,"" the 26-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.

You've probably seen people flooding to supermarkets, trying to get as many items as they can - panic buying things like handwash and antibacterial gel.

Tiff's in charge of the health and beauty section in her supermarket, which includes those items.

And she says the rush of panic buying because of coronavirus has been ""horrible and overwhelming"".

""People have been yelling at me, asking why it's not there when we run out.""

Need for medicines

With cases of Covid-19 rising around the country, you might imagine that lots of frontline workers wouldn't want to work anymore.

But not Mehfuz Dasu Patel.

The 28-year-old helps run a group of community pharmacies in north west England, which serve 250 care homes and deliver medicines to around 20,000 patients.

And those patients are the reason he's still going to work.

If Mehfuz decides to stop working, ""vulnerable people will go without medicines"", he says.

Image copyright Jade Image caption ""It's difficult but people in the NHS have it tougher,"" Jade says

""It's not the sort of business that can just disappear or you can work from home. We have to keep delivering to them, despite what's happening in the world.""

And despite her experiences in the supermarket, Tiff agrees with Mehfuz that it's important for those on the frontline to keep working at a time of crisis.

""People need supplies - they're looking for hygiene products and food - so we have to do what we can. If we don't, it'll just be more anger and panic,"" she says.

'Thinking about my health'

Tiff admits feeling ""anxious and afraid"" because of the uncertainty around the virus and possible impact on her health.

She suffered with a bad cough a few years ago, which she worries has damaged her lungs. People with underlying health problems are at greater risk of developing severe symptoms.

""I'm always thinking about it and a bit worried,"" she says.

And Tiff's not the only one to have those concerns.

Jade Barnett, 19, has two jobs - in a warehouse and a supermarket - and she's worried she could catch the coronavirus at work and take it home to her family.

""It's not as much about me. I just don't want to catch anything and then pass it onto my nan or nephew,"" she says.

She wears gloves at work and is ""quite cautious"". But with lots of people whose jobs are at risk, Jade says she's grateful she's still able to work, despite the potential health risk.

""There are lots of people out there who have lost their jobs, or aren't able to earn any money. How are people meant to survive without money and a job?""

'More responsibility'

Like Tiff and Mehfuz, she acknowledges that she has a vital ""role to play"" in helping the country fight coronavirus.

Jade feels it's something that now comes with ""extra pressure"".

When she's packing deliveries in the warehouse, she's aware that not having all the items someone needs can make things difficult for customers.

""It means they won't get a good shop and it might be someone who can't physically come to the shops,"" she says.

""So you do think about things like that and feel more responsibility.""

When working in the supermarket, she says it can be hard when dealing with elderly people because of limits on buying certain items.

""They often get lots of things and you have to tell them they can't take that much. You feel bad because you never know how much someone needs.""

Image copyright Biodose Image caption 'People need our help', says Mehfuz

Mehfuz says the current crisis is ""the toughest time"" he's ever experienced.

""Everyone at work understands the pressure is on us to deliver for the vulnerable,"" he says, adding that customers have called up worried his service may be shut down.

""They tell us that the country needs you to continue working. That motivates me and the others a lot.""

It's an exhausting time for both Jade and Tiff, and they can't wait for the crisis to be over.

""It can be a lot of night shifts, sometimes 16-hour shifts. It feels like 24/7,"" Jade says. ""Hopefully all of this calms down soon. Because you do have some really rough days and it's not nice.""

""We'll keep working, but even if it's just for a few weeks, we need a break,"" Tiff adds.

More than 6,650 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, but the actual number of cases is estimated to be much higher.

The number of deaths is now 335, according to the latest figures available. More than 77,295 people in the UK have been tested for the respiratory infection but were found not to have it.

If you can't see the look-up click here.

The following charts and graphics will help you understand the situation in the UK and how the authorities are dealing with it.

1. The UK has increased measures to combat the virus

The new coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January.

While there were a number of people testing positive throughout February, figures in the UK began to increase at the beginning of March.

In a bid to slow the virus's spread, all schools in the UK have now closed, except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers. Cafes, bars, leisure centres and other social venues have also been told to shut.

The government had earlier asked people to work from home where possible and halt all unnecessary travel.

Those aged over 70 have also been asked to self isolate at home over the coming weeks and letters are being sent to 1.5 million people in England who are most at risk of coronavirus, urging them to stay at home.

UK figures are currently lower than some other European countries, such as Italy, for example, where there have been more than 59,000 cases and almost 5,500 deaths, according to 23 March figures from the Johns Hopkins University.

Globally, authorities have confirmed more than 360,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 16,000 deaths.

2. London has seen the most deaths

The capital has experienced the highest number of deaths, with figures reaching 129 on Monday.

London Underground passengers have been crowding on to Tube trains, despite warnings to limit non-essential travel.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan has urged workers to stay at home and said public transport should only be used by key workers, otherwise ""people will die"".

London has seen the most cases of coronavirus of any region in the UK.

South-east England and the West Midlands have the second and third highest number of deaths, with 45 and 44 respectively.

The map below shows how cases of the virus have spread across the different regions of the UK.

3. We are in the second phase of the government's response

The government has published its action plan for dealing with the virus, which involves three phases - contain; delay; mitigate - alongside ongoing research.

While the emphasis has been on the contain and research phases up until last week, the country has now moved to the ""delay"" phase to stop the wider spread of the virus.

As part of the delay phase, people with even mild coronavirus symptoms - defined as a temperature above 37.8 C or a ""new, continuous"" cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home for at least seven days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease.

Even if you have no symptoms, the government says you should still:

Stop all non-essential contact with others

Stop all unnecessary travel

Work at home where possible

Avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other social venues

The government is now encouraging self-isolation at home for over 70s, and those more vulnerable to the virus, for 12 weeks.

Mr Johnson said that through ""determined collective action and scientific progress, we will turn the tide of this disease and beat it together"".

British nationals should avoid all non-essential foreign travel to tackle the spread of coronavirus, the Foreign Office has advised.

If the virus becomes even more widespread, the government may then decide to enter the third phase of mitigation, when health services are asked to focus on critical care and retired NHS staff could be asked to return to work.

4. People who think they have coronavirus should self-isolate

Symptoms include a high temperature and a ""new, continuous"" cough - this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual).

If you think you have coronavirus you are advised not to go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Instead, you stay at home for seven days. If you live with other people - they should also stay home for 14 days to see if they develop symptoms.

If your symptoms persist or worsen you should contact the NHS's dedicated 111 online coronavirus service or call 111."

With schools closed to the majority of pupils to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus, parents across the country have been asked to become instant homeschoolers.

How have they coped with their first day of juggling timetables, curricula and coursework - all the while trying to get their own jobs done?

‘It’s about being flexible’

“I’ve kind of done a timetable but I’m not sure how successful that’s going to be – ask me in a few days,” says Bobbie Gordon in Nottingham.

She and her husband - who work in marketing and IT respectively - are trying to be as flexible as possible as they combine work with their new role as homeschoolers to Imogen, 9, Lottie, 6, and four-year-old Hattie.

“We’re just trying to tag-team it,” she says. “It’s about being flexible. We’re just trying to be supportive of each other as well because it is quite difficult for everybody and we’ve both got quite demanding jobs.”

The curriculum involves some schoolwork along with things the parents are keen to share with their kids, whether it’s coding, cooking or teaching them how to use the washing machine.

“It’s life skills stuff,” says Ms Gordon. “Maybe it will help them realise everything that we have to do!”

Image copyright Bobbie Gordon Image caption It's been busy, round at the Gordons'

So far on Monday morning, they have done some writing, planted some seeds in the vegetable patch and made soup together.

Ms Gordon says she’s also keen for her kids to keep in touch with friends by video chat, and the eldest has already organised a daily evening video call with her classmates.

“It’s 16 very excitable nine-year-olds running round their houses and playing instruments and things,” she says.

Day one has gone relatively smoothly, says Ms Gordon, with sunshine and a spacious garden playing their part.

“I suspect in a few weeks’ time if it’s horrible, rainy weather and they can’t get outside there will be harder days ahead,” she says.

‘Kids want routine, stability’

For some parents, it’s been all about maintaining a routine.

Joe Wicks, the fitness instructor and TV presenter, attracted more than 800,000 viewers to his YouTube Channel promising a daily 30-minute workout for kids to start the day.

He told BBC Radio 5 Live he wanted to play a part in reassuring kids that “although this is a weird time, everything is going to be fine, it’s going to return to normal and we’ll be reconnected again”.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Joe Wicks woke a nation

In St Helens, Catherine Ormesher says her 11-year-old daughter Jessica is also benefitting from sticking to a routine, tackling her maths work on Monday morning just as her school timetable says.

“I’m quite shocked actually,” says Ms Ormesher.

She says her daughter’s school took “a massive weight” off of parents by providing them with materials and log-ins for online learning.

The school suggested that parents wake up their children at the normal time and begin work at 09:00 GMT.

“The kids have been sending WhatsApp messages to tell each other that they’re starting their lessons now. They’re following the timetable and getting one another motivated,” says Ms Ormesher, who is a carer.

“They obviously want the routine and the stability.”

Image copyright Catherine Image caption Stability is key

Ms Ormesher said the school’s music teacher started them off with a “wake and shake” – an early morning dance to get kids energised – before a morning of lessons.

At her 11:00 break, Jessica asked Amazon’s Alexa to set a reminder for the start of lessons 20 minutes later.

But her mum says that holding onto the routine may have a special importance for her, as she was in isolation before school closed, having returned from Spain with an illness.

“On Friday a little boy knocked on the door and left all her books and everything from school on our step. When we opened the door and I gave them to Jess, she just broke her heart crying because she hadn’t got to say her goodbyes to her primary school,” she says.

‘We focus on safety, love and fun'

Educational psychologists – such as Zubeida Dasgupta, who is at home in Brighton with her three children – warn that being home for a prolonged period can be difficult and stressful for some children.

Parents may also be stressed and worrying about the health of family members, their finances or food security, she says.

So her approach has been to emphasise that home is not school and she is not a teacher.

“We have decided to focus on safety, love and fun, with a little bit of learning where the children are showing interest,” she says.

One child is very motivated and organised, she says, working through tasks set by school, helping his younger sister and following his interests in skills such as coding.

The others are getting more guidance in activities such as gardening or recording music on the computer. The youngest has volunteered to practise spelling and times tables.

“I think we are all experiencing a feeling of loss of control at the moment, so doing activities where your children can be involved in planning and making decisions - and also succeeding - may help them feel a bit more in control,” Ms Dasgupta says.

“If we can support our children through this, it may well end up being a positive experience. They may develop some resilience and discover new found interests and skills.”"

Governments are advising people to socially distance to reduce the pressure on health services and stop the spread of Covid-19."
http://www.bbc.com/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/52007137,2020-03-23T19:21:15,Tokyo 2020: Why is Olympic decision taking so long?,"Could the sun be setting on the 2020 Olympic Games?

Even the Olympics is not immune. It now seems almost certain that Tokyo 2020 will be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world.

But as the IOC gives itself another four weeks to mull over a delay, what forces are at play behind the biggest peacetime decision world sport has ever seen? Why do they need so long to do what most now see as the only option? And what will the fallout be?

On Tuesday afternoon, the British Olympic Association (BOA) will add their voice to those demanding a postponement, following an emergency conference call with UK Sport, performance directors, and representatives of TeamGB athletes.

Even an actual withdrawal has not been ruled out, depending on the strength of feeling among participants.

Ben Hawes, chair of the TeamGB athletes' commission, told BBC Sport he would present a ""strong viewpoint"" that postponement is the only course of action to take, for the health and wellbeing of athletes.

Several National Olympic Committees (NOCs) from around the world have already requested a postponement, while Canada and Australia have gone further still by saying they will not send their athletes if it begins this year.

IOC member Dick Pound says postponement ""has been decided"", and it will most likely be until 2021, but told USA Today the ""parameters"" have not been finalised, and ""it will come in stages"".

Both the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 organisers have tried to explain how they need time to consider the undoubted complexity of a delayed Olympics.

On Monday, Tomahiko Taniguchi, special advisor to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet, told the BBC that the final solution rests with the IOC.

He said that, given the complexities involved, ""Lausanne must take a few weeks examining scenarios [for a possible postponement] but it is not Tokyo's decision"".

But there has been significant criticism from athletes, including 200m world champion Dina Asher-Smith, about potentially having to wait another four weeks, and Hawes told BBC Sport this timeframe ""does seem too long"".

'A game of chicken'?

According to well-placed sources, we may now be witnessing a 'game of chicken' over who blinks first between the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 organisers, due to the commercial and legal ramifications that could follow such a decision.

Top sports lawyer John Mehrzad QC explains that it will be crucial for litigation purposes who it is that effectively pulls the trigger, because whoever does could open themselves up to potential allegations of breach of the host-city contract.

""The party that 'cancels' or 'postpones' that agreement, unless mutually agreed by the other party, will put itself in breach of contract and expose itself to huge [billions of dollars] damages claims,"" he said.

The recipient of any claim could point to the coronavirus pandemic being a ""force majeure"", or 'Act of God' - though Mehrzad points out that an insurer would be likely to say it must be impossible for the Games to be staged for such a case to stand.

At present, there is no World Health Organization diktat saying that the Olympics cannot be staged.

The IOC has the contractual right to cancel the Games on safety grounds, and is protected from any claims for damages by the host city in such an event.

However, the host-city contract does not refer to postponements, and it is understood that the IOC would much rather it was Japan that ultimately took the decision.

The boycotts from certain major NOCs could therefore play a key role in clearing this logjam, because not having the participation of Team Canada and the Australian delegation would make it an incomplete Games.

The IOC and local organisers could say that this has meant it is no longer possible to proceed with the current schedule, and could provide some protection in the face of any legal cases and insurance claims from the multitude of commercial entities with contracts tied to the event, from broadcasters to sponsors.

Unprecedented and unquantifiable

While a postponement may be inevitable, organising it will not be simple, and there has been some sympathy for the IOC's predicament as they seek a solution to an unprecedented challenge that is not of their making.

Ricardo Fort, head of sponsorship at Coca Cola, one of the Olympics' key commercial partners, said: ""The IOC is taking the right steps to proper evaluate their options. Whatever decisions they make, it will be based on facts (and not on the pressure of any federation... no matter the federation or country.)""

Meanwhile, in Japan even though polls show a majority of people now expect a postponement, there will be fears that such a decision, no matter how understandable in the circumstances, will amount to a huge loss of face. After all, no Olympics has ever been rescheduled. The only cancelled Games have occurred in wartime.

Both the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organisers have highlighted that postponing a Games that has a budget of £10.8bn ($12.6bn/1.35trillion yen) comes with ""many, many challenges"".

In a statement, Tokyo 2020 said: ""As we seek to address this unique situation, close coordination with many partners, including the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, the Government of Japan, Tokyo 2020 marketing partners, broadcasters, suppliers and contractors, will be essential.""

The IOC, meanwhile, pointed out that there have been ""millions of nights"" booked in hotels, which may not be available for a rescheduled Games. There is also the question of whether the Athletes' Village and other key venues will still be available given pre-agreed deals with private occupiers, and the need to find tenants. Can Japan really afford for these venues to remain empty for another year? Will a new Athletes' Village need to be built?

However, some within the Olympic movement fear that by appearing to many to be ponderous and out of touch with athletes' concerns, with each day that passes, significant damage is being done to the IOC's brand at a time when it is already concerned about attracting future host cities, and athletes feel left in limbo.

After all, as recently as 4 March in Lausanne following an executive board meeting, Bach remarkably claimed the words 'postponement' and 'cancellation' had not even been mentioned during discussions.

Given the relentless speed of the outbreak, that seemed at best naive and at worst downright negligent to some. Maybe Bach's hands were tied by Japanese partners loathe to even contemplate a change of plan. Almost certainly a Plan B was in fact being discussed but to many it gave the impression of a sports body in an ivory tower and in denial.

And it may be that the IOC now has to dip into its significant reserves to help bail out the many international sports federations that depend on financial handouts thanks to the £5bn revenues generated from each Olympic cycle, and which now looks set to be delayed by a year. Some of these federations will have insurance to mitigate the impact of this shock. But others will not and could face a worrying future.

The athlete voice

Several athletes have been keen to stress that they are the key stakeholders in an Olympics and the previous messaging from the IOC to keep preparing as normal risked putting them and their families at risk.

The competitor-led movement Global Athlete has called for a postponement, saying ""athletes do not have the ability to appropriately prepare for these Games and their health and safety must come first"".

Before tomorrow's conference call, Hawes said: ""My hope is that we'll come out of tomorrow with a much clearer picture and a consistent picture across athlete feeling and sentiment as well as the sports, the BOA and UK Sport as an organisation.

""From what I've heard so far, everyone is pretty much in agreement with the fact that this now really starting to challenge athletes, both mentally and physically, and we need to have a solution.

""The solution won't come until the IOC makes the decision but the more pressure that can come on from the most critical stakeholders at this point, which is the athletes, the better. We will be going into it with a strong viewpoint which we have been talking to the BOA about for many weeks now.""

When asked to clarify if the position from the Athletes' Commission was one in favour of a postponement, he said: ""Yes I believe that for the health and wellbeing of our athletes we have to have some clarity on a postponement, even if it that needs time to understand when that might be.""

When could it be moved to?

There is no clear consensus on when the Games should be moved to, mainly due to each sport having its own calendar to consider, and the continued uncertainty surrounding when the pandemic may ease.

The example of the Euros being pushed back almost exactly a year could be followed, and currently appears the most likely.

The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) telling its athletes to prepare for a 2021 Games could be particularly telling, given the AOC President John Coates is chair of the IOC's Coordination Commission for Tokyo.

A 12-month delay of the Olympics would clash with the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, which are scheduled to run from 6-15 August 2021.

World Athletics has already been in touch with the organisers, who have given assurances that they will look for alternative dates if that proves necessary.

The Championships wouldn't necessarily need to be pushed back by a year - one option could be bringing it forward by a few months.

The Women's Rugby World Cup will be in New Zealand in July and August.

Alternatively, the Games could be postponed to later in 2020, when it would be cooler.

The Olympics have been held in autumn before, and the last Tokyo Olympics, in 1964, were held in October, and the Trinidad and Tobago Olympic Committee told an IOC teleconference last week that rescheduling to October was ""practical and reasonable"".

But it would then clash with the European football season and major US sports.

And with US media giant NBC being one of the most important voices in these discussions, a delay of a year looks most likely.

Amid the staggering collapse of the global sporting calendar in recent weeks, the Tokyo Games is the last to fall. But this is no mere sports championships. It is a multi-billion pound mega-event that, as we have seen repeatedly, places a huge economic strain on its hosts.

This explains perhaps why there is currently something of a dance going on between those at the top table.

Each party is waiting for the other to make the move, while also trying to figure out the safest, and least financially and reputationally damaging, solution.

It may not take four weeks, though. With pressure mounting, do not be surprised if the plug is pulled much sooner."

It was late at night on Thursday 12 March when Aviah Sarah Day realised things were serious. Five days earlier she'd thought nothing of going to a nightclub packed with sweaty revellers.

Now, as the latest news about the coronavirus outbreak came in, it began to dawn on her just how difficult life was about to become for the millions of British people who would end up stuck inside their homes.

Image copyright Aviah Sarah Day Image caption At first, Aviah Sarah Day thought no-one was interested

And then, as she sat on her sofa looking at the newsfeed on her phone, she saw something that gave her hope. In Lewisham, across the river in south London, a Facebook group had been set up for people who wanted to offer their services to neighbours who might be confined to their homes as a result of the outbreak - to fetch their groceries, walk their dogs, pick up prescriptions or simply have a chat over the phone or Skype if they were feeling lonely or frightened.

So Day, who is 32 and a university lecturer, set up a Facebook group for Hackney too. By the time she went to bed, no-one had joined: ""I thought no-one was interested,"" she recalls. But when she woke up in the morning, the group had hundreds of members. Today it has nearly 7,000.

Since it became clear just how widespread self-isolation would become, tens of thousands of people have been thinking the same way as Day.

Lewisham was the first, but by the end of the weekend, there were several hundred around the UK. WhatsApp and Nextdoor proved popular tools as well as Facebook. Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK, an umbrella organisation for these spontaneous community groups from Caithness to Cornwall, says there are now over 1,000. The community organising group, Acorn, has a web page connecting volunteers with people in need too.

Some local groups cover entire cities.

Others are focused on individual streets, estates or a single block of flats. The motivation among volunteers is broadly the same - to do what they can to help their neighbours, especially those in greatest need.

""As a young person who's not at a high risk of dying, you feel responsible,"" says 17-year-old student Eleanor Anrade May, who helped set up the Devon Mutual Aid Group. And for many volunteers, at a time of widespread panic and unease, the ability to do something - anything - provides at least a tiny measure of control over the situation.

A week on, Day - who helped set up groups covering the Redbridge local authority area (where she lives) and Barking and Dagenham too - is consumed by the work in hand. Throughout the day her phone pings with messages and updates, and there are virtual meetings on the Zoom app (which people who are self-isolating can also take part in).

In east London, there are Facebook groups for each borough and WhatsApp groups at ward and sometimes street level. Signing up as a volunteer is one thing, finding a system that matches all the jobs that need doing - leafleting homes with offers of support, delivering groceries, fetching vital medicines - is another.

""There's people going out leafleting, there's people doing Facebook admin roles,"" Day says. Not all generate equal levels of enthusiasm: ""There are some more popular tasks than others, and dog-walking is definitely up there,"" she adds. But so far at least there are still enough bodies to go around.

It's not just about making sure households are stocked up with milk and bread, either. Ensuring people have some kind of connection to the outside world is a priority, too. One of the cases that has affected Day most was an older man with HIV, who was self-isolating. ""He was feeling a bit lonely and just wanted to chat to somebody."" He was put in touch with volunteers who spoke to him by phone.

Some of those who've volunteered have already seen their good deed repaid. Hannah Martin, 31, was keen to help out in any way she could. She signed up to her local WhatsApp group in Denmark Hill, South London, and her phone number was added to a leaflet delivered through the doors of nearby streets offering support to anyone who needed it.

Then she started coughing. Her partner developed a fever. Neither of them had a thermometer, so they asked the group for one. ""Lo and behold a thermometer was dropped at the door,"" she says. Although she didn't see herself as a particularly vulnerable person, she valued the sense of feeling cared for as she began her self-isolation. ""It's a really nice feeling, being looked after by your neighbours.""

The benefits of setting up a group like this might be obvious, but anyone who does so quickly encounters countless practical difficulties. For instance, what does data protection law say about maintaining databases of volunteers and those who need help? What about safeguarding them if they're vulnerable? Do you need to carry out a criminal record check? What's the most hygienic way of delivering a leaflet or a bag of groceries?

These are issues the groups have had to get to grips with quickly, and all at once. It's compounded by the fact that they've grown exponentially in just a few days.

Jamie Haxby, 31, is an outreach worker for a church in Lancaster. When it set up the Lancaster Coronavirus Response Support Line, its Facebook page rapidly attracted more than 1,000 members. He found himself speaking to a woman who lived hundreds of miles away in Kent - her parents, both in their 80s, live in Lancaster and it reassured her to know they had a source of support.

Image copyright Jamie Haxby Image caption Jamie Haxby advises keeping things simple

Haxby was able to draw on his own experience of working closely with local authorities and voluntary sector organisations, as well the specialist skills of other church members. One was a software engineer; he set up a platform which allows volunteers to submit an application for a Disclosure and Barring Service background check, and once they are cleared, allocates them to a particular job and alerts them by text.

The Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK umbrella group has guidance for things like hygiene, safeguarding, data protection and running meetings online.

Haxby warns that smaller groups with less experience and wherewithal could quickly find themselves out of their depth, facing a host of unforeseen problems.

The most important thing to remember, he says, is keeping it simple: ""We're a bit limited in terms of what we can do - leave stuff, pick stuff up, speak to them on the phone.""

Given the widespread use of Facebook as an organising tool, there is also unease about the capacity for the social media platform and others like it to spread false rumours and misinformation.

It's a big concern for John Morris, 27, who set up Nottingham Covid-19 Mutual Aid on Saturday and found himself ""running a small NGO within two days"" - its Facebook page now has over 15,000 members.

A crucial early task was organising a rota of 20 moderators to enforce one of the page's key rules - any health advice shared on it can only come from reputable sources such as the NHS, the government or the World Health Organization.

Photos of empty shelves were banned too: ""So no toilet roll posts,"" he says. ""We don't want to get people panicking.""

And for Day, one of the most important functions of the groups has been to deepen her faith in human nature. The footage of panic-buying doesn't tell the full story, she says. ""This has shown me that people want to help each other."""

Scientists are to track the spread of the coronavirus in the UK by using clues in its genetic code.

Analysing samples collected from patients will also reveal whether the virus is mutating into new strains.

There have been more than 5,600 laboratory-confirmed cases in the UK so far, but the true figure is far, far higher.

The government said the £20m project would improve understanding of the pandemic and ""ultimately save lives"".

Genetic blueprint

The genetic code is the blueprint for building a virus.

However, that blueprint subtly changes as the virus mutates.

Sequencing the coronavirus's genetic code from different patients allows researchers to build up a picture of how the virus is spreading.

For example, a group of patients with nearly identical coronaviruses infecting them may all be part of the same cluster.

The same techniques, used at a hospital in Cambridge, were able to identify the source of an outbreak of the superbug MRSA.

""This virus is one of the biggest threats our nation has faced in recent times,"" said Prof Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at Public Health England.

""Harnessing innovative genome technologies will help us tease apart the complex picture of coronavirus spread in the UK.""

Most of the time the coronavirus mutations do not mean anything, but this is also a virus that has only just made the jump from animals to humans.

The virus, named officially Sars-CoV-2, was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

Since then, the disease it causes, Covid-19, has killed more than 14,000 people around the world.

However, the virus may still be adapting as part of its shift to infecting people and interacting with human immune systems.

It is something scientists will want to keep an eye on as it could affect how the virus is treated in the future.

Viruses will accumulate mutations which allow them, for example, to evade immune responses.

There's lots of information about this for viruses like HIV, hepatitis C and influenza, said Prof Paul Klenerman, from the University of Oxford, who will be part of the project.

He added: ""If there is variability in key parts of the virus, it would be incredibly important for vaccine design.""

The project - called the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium - is a collaboration between the NHS, public health agencies and the Wellcome Sanger Institute universities.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""This new consortium will bring together the UK's brightest and best scientists to build our understanding of this pandemic, tackle the disease and ultimately, save lives.""

Samples from patients with confirmed cases of Covid-19 will be sent to a sequencing centres in Belfast, Birmingham, Cambridge, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Exeter, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Norwich, Nottingham, Oxford and Sheffield."

How do you think the government is handling the Coronavirus crisis?

Your view might depend on where in the UK you are reading this.

It might depend on your own circumstances.

Your family, your health, your age, your faith, your job.

Each one of us is wrestling with a very personal set of dilemmas around risk and responsibilities.

The risk to our health and others, the risk to our livelihoods.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Londoners got fresh air this weekend in Battersea Park, but the number of cases of coronavirus continues to grow

The responsibilities to our families, our employees, our community.

Lay people - ie most of us - are attempting to interpret fairly generic symptoms, particularly in children.

We might be fretting about the wellbeing of (otherwise well) children caught in quarantine because others are unwell.

What about the trade off between our domestic responsibilities and those we might have as key workers to wider society?

And then, enter next, the government - like any other organisation, a collection of fallible individuals - caught up in this like the rest of us, but making decisions of a magnitude they have never made before and probably never imagined ever having to make.

A rapidly changing global situation collides with huge trade offs between giant concepts - such as liberty and safety.

A prime minister, famed for his phraseology and his capacity to communicate, faces thundering criticism in The Times.

""The prime minister who dreamt of being Churchill may find himself cast as Neville Chamberlain,"" The Times said in a wounding swipe; Boris Johnson is, it claims, ""hesitant and behind the curve"".

And yet at least one poll suggested broad support for the government's approach.

Then there's the alien concept, let alone the barely heard phrase, a matter of weeks ago, of social distancing.

Again, advice we are left to wrestle with: the pub and the leisure centre are shut. But do get fresh air, the medics suggested.

Cue a weekend of spots famed for their fresh air proving rather popular.

Perhaps some wantonly ignoring advice. Perhaps others acting in good faith personally, but discovering others have independently chosen to do exactly the same thing, collectively defeating the object.

There must be a louder, more comprehensive public education campaign, some demand.

The government counters it is the biggest ever in peacetime.

Behavioural science is being deployed - attempts to predict how society will react.

But attempting to predict how we will collectively respond to something entirely unprecedented in the lifetimes of any of us.

This is, bluntly, a grave, three dimensional, rapidly changing situation, where none of us from the prime minister down can be certain what the outcome will be; medically, psychologically, sociologically on any of us; all of us.

And here's the central truth.

None of us are observers.

We are all participants."
http://www.bbc.com/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51997151,2020-03-23T13:35:28,Coronavirus: What is shielding?,"Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Cancer patients need to take extra care

More than a million people most at risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus are being asked to stay at home for at least 12 weeks.

This ""shielding"" is to protect lives, with those affected being written to over the next couple of days.

Why do it?

Cases of coronavirus are increasing rapidly in the UK, which suggests it is circulating in the community and spreading from person to person.

While everyone is being advised to keep their distance from other people to help stop the spread, some people with underlying health conditions need to take even more precautions to protect themselves.

Who should do it?

Those most at risk, who include:

Solid organ transplant recipients

Some people with cancer who are undergoing treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy

People on immunosuppression drugs

Women who are pregnant and have heart disease

People with severe respiratory conditions - cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and COPD

Some people with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency

Anyone in this highest risk category who has not received a letter from the NHS by Sunday 29 March 2020 or been contacted by their doctor should get in touch with their GP or hospital doctor by phone or online.

This does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to practice social distancing and only go out if really necessary.

Is it compulsory?

Experts strongly advise people with serious underlying health conditions to follow the advice. If this applies to you, shielding is for your personal protection - it is your choice to decide whether to follow the recommendations.

You could call your doctor to discuss this.

What does it entail?

It means staying at home at all times. You should not go out to shop or go for a walk in public places - it is fine to go into your garden if you have one.

You should avoid any face-to-face contact, so that means no visitors.

Visits from people who provide you essential healthcare and personal support are fine. Carers and care workers should stay away if they have any of the symptoms of coronavirus and anyone coming into your home should keep their hands clean by washing with soap and water.

What about any people I live with?

They do not need to shield themselves but must make sure they follow recommendations to shield you.

They should also stringently follow the guidance on social distancing.

They should also keep some physical distance (two metres) from you and keep to a minimum the time spent in shared spaces such as the kitchen, bathroom and lounge. Shared spaces should be kept well ventilated - open a window.

If you can, use a separate bathroom and bedroom from the rest of the household, and also make sure you use separate towels.

Image caption Don't share cutlery

If you share a toilet and bathroom, make sure they are cleaned after every use. Consider drawing up a rota for bathing, with you using the facilities first.

Use the kitchen when others are not in there and take your meals back to your room to eat. Coronavirus is spread through droplets (from coughs and sneezes), so do not share cutlery or crockery, unless it is clean. Use a dishwasher if you have one. Soap or washing up liquid and water gets rid of the virus too.

Keep surfaces that are frequently touched clean - door handles, taps and handrails.

What about my medicine and food?

Communities Minister Robert Jenrick said parcels of food, which would be free initially, and medicines would be delivered to those affected via community hubs.

The Treasury will cover the cost and in time hope to refine the scheme so it is ""more tailored to individuals' needs"".

How long will shielding last?

The advice is for 12 weeks from the day you receive the recommendation. You will be contacted again if the advice is updated.

What should I do if I get a cough or fever?

These are symptoms of coronavirus. It does not mean that you definitely have it, but you should contact the NHS 111 online coronavirus service or call NHS 111 or your doctor. Do this as soon as you get symptoms. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or hospital.

In an emergency, call 999 if you are seriously ill.

Other tips to stay safe and well

Good hygiene can stop the virus spreading:

Keep physically active by exercising indoors or in your garden if that's possible.

Look after your mental wellbeing. Stay in touch with friends on the phone, by post or online.

Prepare a hospital bag just in case - this should include your emergency contact, a list of medicines you take and any information on your planned care appointments as well as things you would need for an overnight stay, such as a toothbrush and pyjamas.

Welcome to this new pop-up podcast to see you through the days of Covid-19. Let's get started.

If you're now either working from home and socially isolating or quarantining after showing possible coronavirus symptoms, it's likely you're coming to terms with how much spare time you suddenly have.

Earlier this week, the government advised against going out for ""non-essential"" reasons, and many schools and businesses across the UK have now closed.

This has left tens of thousands of us stuck inside our homes for large chunks of time - needing more than a boxset binge and the odd four-way video chat to see us through.

Coronavirus: What are social distancing and self-isolation?

Radio 1 Newsbeat spoke to people in this situation to see how they're dealing with all this enforced alone time. While some are learning new skills, making good on existing life goals and starting new creative projects - others are finding it harder to adapt to such drastic changes to their daily lives.

The joy of stitching

""I've taken up a new hobby that I never thought about trying before - cross-stitching and embroidery.""

Maddy Bateson, 21, is self-isolating in her student house in Salford. Before deciding to focus on embroidery, she watched a fair bit of TV and played The Sims but soon grew bored of her more usual pastimes.

""I'm not very good yet but doing something different takes my mind off things. Instead of just watching TV, I put some music on and embroider a little flower on my jeans.""

Maddy's top tip for not allowing the isolation to overwhelm you is to stay in touch with family through voice notes.

""It's nice to hear someone's voice - not everyone wants to pick up the phone and ring all the time so short voice notes can really help.""

She's also been video chatting with her mates but says she's learning to enjoy the silence too.

""It's been nice to get a bit of time away from my phone and having to be in constant contact with people. Now, I can just chill by myself and spend a few hours cross-stitching.""

'Find joy in the small things'

Joe Flinders, 26, has been working remotely from his home in Manchester and social distancing for several days.

""I'm not someone that does great in my own company - I'm quite an extrovert,"" he says.

His usual routine sees him out and about either at the gym or hanging out with mates. He found the best way to adjust to his new reality was by writing a big list of plans like clearing out his wardrobe and relearning the piano.

""I'm going to do a nutrition course too over several weeks. It will keep me busy and also educate me.""

On top of all that, he's going to start helping his younger sister, whose GCSE's have been cancelled, keep up with her schoolwork.

""She's got lot of revision materials, so to help her and keep us all busy, I'm going to quiz her on bits of her different subjects.""

He advises those struggling with the initial impact of self-isolation to find ""small things that give you joy throughout the day"".

Fight back with fashion

Charlotte, 26, was working in a bar until the coronavirus crisis struck. Now, she's at home - practising social distancing as much as possible.

To stave off the boredom she started sewing.

""It's funny because when I was 14, or 15, I did a sewing class and I was, like, I will never use that!""

Now, she's started a fashion project inspired by the face masks that have become synonymous with the virus worldwide.

""On the streets and on the bus, I started seeing so many people wearing these blue and white masks. And I just thought - why not try and make a prettier version to put some light into this awful situation?""

Image copyright contributor photo Image caption Charlotte is clear her face masks don't offer medical protection

The official advice on face masks is that they are not an effective way of protecting yourself from Covid-19, and they could even create a false sense of security.

Charlotte is clear that her masks are intended as a fashion accessory only.

""People on social media ask me about this and I make it very clear that none of these masks protect against the virus,"" she says. ""For me, it's just a way of keeping my body and my mind busy - it can be scary when you think too much about the virus.""

After posting, her designs on Instagram she was surprised by how much positive feedback she got.

""Being able to be creative really helps with my wellbeing,"" she says. ""For me, it's a form of self-care and a great way to use my time at home.""

'I haven't felt fresh air for days'

But, others have found it harder to adapt to life indoors.

Joe Wilmot is a student, living in a shared house in Manchester. He's been self-isolating for almost a week.

Although, he is able to access to his university work easily from home, he's struggling to adjust to staying indoors.

""Apart from having the balcony doors open, I don't think I've really felt fresh air for days. And because I've been cleaning non-stop, my flat smells of chemicals.""

At first, he thought about taking up a new hobby like knitting, but then realised he would need to stop isolating to go and buy the wool and needles.

Image copyright Joe Wilmot Image caption Joe recommends turning off the news at times

Instead, he's discovered new things about himself.

""It turns out, I'm skilled at staying horizontal in bed for about 12 hours a day, which is something that even as a student I didn't know I could do.

""So, I've just stayed in bed binge-watching TV shows. At first, I was watching the news constantly too but now I'm getting to the point where I want to distract myself from things going on outside.""

If you do end up turning to TV for solace, Joe recommends finding shows that make you laugh.

""Re-watching comedy shows like The Thick of It can really boost your mood and stop you thinking about the fact you can't go anywhere.""

Too offset all the time he's been spending in bed, Joe has also been copying workouts from social media.

""I follow this guy called Alex on Instagram who puts on lycra and does exercises in his living room. So I've been putting my shorts on and following his routines - and that, to be honest, is what is getting me through this crisis."""
http://www.bbc.com/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366,2020-03-23T20:49:52,Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself?,"Coronavirus has spread to 169 countries or territories, including the UK, and claimed more than 16,000 lives.

So, what is the disease, how does it spread and when are people most infectious?

How do I protect myself?

The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water.

Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth.

So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important for limiting the spread.

Face masks do not provide effective protection, according to medical experts.

What are the coronavirus symptoms?

Coronavirus infects the lungs. The symptoms start with a fever followed by a dry cough, which can lead to breathing problems.

This is a new, continuous cough and means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or having three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual).

It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, scientists have said, but some people will get symptoms much later than this. In fact the World Health Organization (WHO) says the incubation period lasts up to 14 days.

People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but there have been suggestions some can spread the virus even before they are sick.

The early symptoms can easily be confused with other winter bugs including colds and flu.

What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

How deadly is coronavirus?

The proportion dying from the disease appears low (between 1% and 2%) - but the figures are unreliable.

Thousands are being treated but may go on to die - so the death rate could be higher. But it may also be lower if lots of mild cases are unreported.

A World Health Organization examination of data from 56,000 patients suggests:

6% become critically ill - lung failure, septic shock, organ failure and risk of death

14% develop severe symptoms - difficulty breathing and shortness of breath

80% develop mild symptoms - fever and cough and some may have pneumonia

Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. The data from China also suggests that men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women.

Treatment relies on keeping the patient's body going, including breathing support, until their immune system can fight off the virus. Work to develop a vaccine is under way.

What should I do if I think I have coronavirus?

Patients with mild symptoms - such as a new continuous cough or a high temperature above 37.8C should self-isolate at home for at least seven days, according to the latest advice issued by Public Health England.

People are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E.

Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP.

If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate. Advice for people who have travelled back to the UK from affected areas and who may need to self-isolate, has been issued.

Other countries have introduced their own measures For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people showing symptoms to call their healthcare provider, and those who are mildly ill to self-isolate.

The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public.

Who gets tested and how does it work?

In its latest advice, Public Health England (PHE) has said those who are self-isolating with mild symptoms will not be tested.

However, all hospital patients with flu-like symptoms will be tested.

If you need testing in the UK results may be available on the same day, but you may be asked to stay at home and self-isolate. while you wait.

How fast is it spreading?

Tens of thousands of new cases are being reported worldwide each day. However, it is thought health agencies may be unaware of many cases.

After starting in China, coronavirus is now spreading fast in many other countries.

It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 cases and just four days for the third 100,000 cases.

Children across the UK will be off school for an indefinite period of time because of coronavirus. Some are likely to be anxious, so how can parents help them cope?

No school for the ""foreseeable"" future. Exams off. Clubs closed.

Millions of children will be looking forward to a spring, and possibly a summer, free of responsibility and routine. But these are not normal times - they're likely to have to spend days and nights indoors with parents or guardians.

They won't get much personal contact with friends and, for teenagers, the cancellation of exams will make a difficult time of year even more worrying.

""It's the perfect storm for parents and children,"" says Sam Cartwright-Hatton, professor of clinical child psychology at the University of Sussex.

""It's not just the fact that they're going to be cooped up together. Emotions are also going to be super-stressed because - on top of what young people are feeling - parents are worried about jobs, food supplies, paying the next mortgage bill.""

Consistent routine

Image copyright Getty Images

As households begin this forced experiment in enclosed living, Prof Cartwright-Hatton advocates setting a clear routine, particularly for younger children - such as a couple of hours of school work in the morning or a specified time for craft work in the afternoon.

She argues that pre-teenage children ""turn inwards quite quickly"" if they spend too much time alone.

Parents should play with them and encourage those of an adventurous nature to regard the situation as an ""adventure"". This approach won't work for the more sensitive children who will need extra reassurance.

Prof Cartwright-Hatton recommends keeping classmates and members of clubs like Brownies, football teams and music groups in touch via Skype, FaceTime, Zoom or other video-conferencing services. This would allow them to share details of their day and play games.

""I would worry about a child who had no-one to play with for six months. We're going to have to get creative in keeping children connected to their peer groups. Kerplunk won't work on Skype, but Cluedo or Monopoly might.""

Get out, if you can

Going out won't be as easy as it usually is, which could add to a feeling of claustrophobia as spring and summer approach. Those with gardens are encouraged to use them for fresh air and exercise.

""A balance has to be struck between mental and physical health, depending on what the next piece of official information is,"" says Eva Lloyd OBE, professor of early childhood at the University of East London.

""If it's safe to go the park, people should do that too.""

Limit the doom and gloom

It's impossible to shield all but the youngest children from coronavirus talk, particularly with parents turning on TVs at 17:00 GMT for the latest government briefing.

But Prof Cartwright-Hatton suggests not exposing under-10s to any news at all, except in tailored forms such as the BBC's Newsround, which consults experts on its likely psychological impact.

Teenagers are better equipped to make their own judgements, but they should not be left in their rooms for hours on end searching the internet or using social media unsupervised, she warns.

Another potential outcome of so much information coming children's way - along with a great deal of advice, such as standing two metres away from grandparents to avoid possible transmission - is ""guilt"", says Prof Lloyd.

""I worry that they'll wonder whether this is happening because of something they've done,"" she adds. ""It's a very strange situation for them. We've got to show them that none of this is their fault and that children throughout the world are going through the same experience.""

Coronavirus news is grim for people of all ages, but parents can offer perspective.

""Downplay their fears but be realistic,"" says Prof Cartwright-Hilton. ""Don't promise things that you can't be sure aren't true. If there's misinformation about the number of deaths from coronavirus, you can counter that.

""But, whenever you've discussed coronavirus, move on afterwards, so children don't spend too much time thinking about it.""

Exam fears

Students who were due to take their GCSEs, A-levels, Highers and other exams have had them cancelled. They don't know when or if they will go ahead at a future date.

Teenagers who would otherwise be revising could now be at home wondering how they will get their qualifications.

""I'd listen and be very sympathetic,"" says Prof Cartwright-Hatton. ""Whatever emotions the situation is throwing up, tell them you understand how awful it must be at the moment and what a shame it is.

""But let them know you can't solve this for them. If they are really catastrophising about it - worrying that they won't go to university and won't get a job - correct that, because it's not the case.""

Be prepared to change

The situation the UK finds itself in is new for parents and children.

Prof Lloyd says families should hold a ""review"" at the end of every week to discuss how the arrangement is faring.

""It's going to be challenging,"" she says. ""If it's not working, people will need to change it. We should include the children in discussions. From the age of about two they will want to have an input.""

Discussions between parents over their own coronavirus worries can wait until after children have gone to bed, Prof Lloyd adds.

When will it end?

At the best of times, children are inclined to ask: ""Are we nearly there yet?"" or ""Is it nearly over?"" Explaining the word ""indefinite"" might prove problematic.

""For young children that's an emerging concept,"" says Prof Lloyd. ""You get them to imagine the summer holidays, that it would be long like them, but not so much fun.""

The upside

It's a daunting prospect for parents, taking over what the state has offered for well over a century - daytime education and childcare. But might there be another way of looking at things to ensure the coming weeks and months are more bearable?

""We often talk about work-life balance and parents not being able to spend enough time with kids,"" says Prof Cartwright-Hatton. ""That's not going to be a problem for a lot of people for quite a while now. We've got to look for the silver lining in all this."""

Coronavirus can affect anyone, but people with pre-existing health problems and older people are thought to be at greater risk of developing severe symptoms.

If you have a long-term health condition you may be feeling anxious. So here's what experts are advising.

Who is at risk?

Having a health condition does not make you more likely than anyone else to come into contact with coronavirus.

But it appears people who are older, those with weakened immune systems and people who have underlying chronic conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, or asthma, are more at risk of severe effects if they do catch it.

Most people recover from coronavirus quickly after a few days' rest. For some people, it can be more severe and sometimes life-threatening. The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as cold and flu:

a cough

a high temperature

shortness of breath

People at higher risk include those who are over 70, regardless of whether they have a medical condition or not, and people under 70 with any of the following underlying health conditions:

chronic (long-term) respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema or bronchitis

chronic heart disease, such as heart failure

chronic kidney disease

chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis

chronic neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), a learning disability or cerebral palsy

diabetes

problems with your spleen - for example, sickle cell disease or if you have had your spleen removed

a weakened immune system as the result of conditions such as HIV and AIDS, or medicines such as steroid tablets or chemotherapy

being seriously overweight (a BMI of 40 or above)

those who are pregnant

Everyone is being told to follow social-distancing measures to help reduce the chance of catching and spreading coronavirus. People in higher risk groups are strongly advised to follow the advice.

From Monday, around 1.5m people at the greatest risk of complications, such as patients having treatment for cancer or people on immunosuppressant therapy, will be asked to isolate at home for 12 weeks to protect themselves. They will get special guidance from the NHS.

If you think you are in this highest risk category and have not received a letter from the NHS by Sunday 29 March 2020 or been contacted by your GP, get in touch with your GP or hospital doctor by phone or online.

I have asthma, what should I do?

Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your preventer inhaler (usually brown) daily as prescribed. This will help cut your risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus.

Image copyright Getty Images

Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service.

Start a peak flow diary if you have a peak flow meter as it can be a good way of tracking your asthma and helping to tell the difference between your asthma symptoms and coronavirus illness.

I'm elderly, should I self-isolate?

The latest advice from the government's chief medical adviser is that everyone - regardless of age - should now be stopping non-essential contact with others to help stop the spread of the virus and protect the most vulnerable. That means avoiding gatherings with friends and family as well as crowded places.

This is particularly important for people over 70 and those with underlying health conditions because they are at higher risk of developing more severe symptoms if they become infected.

People at the highest risk of complications - around 1.5m people - are being asked to isolate at home for 12 weeks to protect themselves. They will get special guidance from the NHS.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, recommends that people with elderly friends and relatives make sure they check on them regularly.

Older people and their families can call Age UK Advice for free on 0800 169 65 65.

What if I have a chronic health issue?

Anyone with a higher risk from viruses such as cold or flu should take sensible steps to reduce the risk of picking up infections.

Those who begin to show symptoms - a new, persistent cough and fever - should stay at home. If the symptoms get worse or are no better after seven days, they should call their GP or use the NHS 111 service.

I have diabetes, what should I do?

Those living with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes could be at greater risk of more severe symptoms. Dan Howarth, head of care at Diabetes UK, said: ""Coronavirus or Covid-19 can cause complications in people with diabetes.

""If you have diabetes and you have symptoms such as cough, high temperature and feeling short of breath, you need to monitor your blood sugar closely.""

If you have these symptoms you should stay at home for seven days and continue taking your medication. Do not go to a GP practice, pharmacy or hospital, even if you have a hospital appointment. Use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, your condition gets worse or your symptoms do not get better after seven days.

If you routinely monitor your blood glucose, on the advice of your doctor, you should continue to do this more often. If you don't check your blood sugar levels at home, be aware of the signs of hyperglycaemia, which include being very thirsty, passing more urine than normal (especially at night), headaches, tiredness and lethargy. You should call your doctor if you have these symptoms.

If you don't have any coronavirus symptoms and want to attend a routine diabetes appointment, check if you can do this online or over the phone instead of visiting a clinic in person.

Should pregnant women worry?

There is no evidence yet that pregnant women (and their babies) are at increased risk if they catch coronavirus, but the government is saying mums-to-be should be extra cautious for now. Like anyone, they should take steps to avoid infection. They are among people who should be ""particularly stringent"" in minimising their social contact, says the official advice.

Pregnant healthcare workers are advised:

If you are less than 28 weeks pregnant and have no underlying health conditions you should practise social distancing but can continue to work, but avoid, where possible, caring for patients with suspected coronavirus infection, through the use of personal protective equipment and risk assessment.

If you are more than 28 weeks pregnant or at any stage of pregnancy an also have underlying health conditions such as heart or lung disease, avoid direct contact with patients.

I'm a smoker, am I at higher risk?

Deborah Arnott, chief executive of public health charity, Ash, advises that those who smoke heavily should either cut back or try to quit entirely to lower their risk.

""Smokers are more likely to get respiratory infections and twice as likely to develop pneumonia as non-smokers,"" she said.

""Quitting smoking is good for your health in so many ways and smokers should see coronavirus as further motivation to give quitting a go to build up their body's defences now before coronavirus becomes widespread in the UK.""

What about my medication?

It is important that even if you are unwell, you continue to take your prescribed medication. If you need to collect prescriptions while unwell, ask a friend or family member to collect them for you.

Do I need a flu jab?

Coronavirus is an entirely different virus to flu, so the flu jab won't prevent infection, but flu can also make you sick and can be severe in certain people.

If you have not yet had your flu jab there is still time to get one. People aged 65 and over, pregnant women and children and adults with underlying health conditions or weakened immune systems can get one for free on the NHS.

So how can I stay safe?

The virus is thought to be spread by coughs and via contaminated surfaces, such as handrails and door handles in public places.

Good hygiene can stop the virus spreading:

Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze

Put used tissues in the bin immediately

Wash your hands with soap and water often - use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available

Try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell

Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean

Keep physically active by exercising indoors or in your garden if that's possible.

Should I use a face mask?

The British Lung Foundation says it does not recommend using a face mask ""as there isn't enough evidence to show how effective they are. Also, for people living with a lung condition wearing a face mask can make breathing more difficult."""

Life in the UK has largely been put on hold, hitting businesses and their employees hard. Many sectors have already seen widespread redundancies, with firms warning thousands more jobs could be wiped out.

""I'm not angry, I don't blame anyone,"" says Holly Eyre, 28.

She has moved back home with her parents in Leeds, after being made redundant from her ""dream job"" of managing a bar and restaurant in Newcastle, where she has lived for the past eight years.

Ms Eyre says around half the staff at the independent restaurant have been let go because of the virus. ""Moments after the advice came [to avoid non-essential travel], we started receiving cancellation calls,"" she says.

""As a brand new member of the team, I'd only been there a couple of weeks,"" she says.

Ms Eyre, who is also a trained English teacher, says she is going to change jobs. ""I don't think the hospitality sector will survive the next few months.""

Ms Eyre says the government's plan to pay 80% of wages for staff kept on by employers comes too late. It is understood the plan will apply to firms that have already laid off workers - but only if they are brought back into the workforce by bosses.

""I have been made redundant on Tuesday, as have so many others,"" she says. ""This does not help me.""

But she adds: ""I'm not in a difficult situation really. I have got my parents to fall back on,"" she says. ""I'm really lucky.""

'Don't know how I'll survive'

Image copyright Tom Danousias Image caption Tom Danousias says he was surprised at how he was treated by his employer

Among those who are more worried about their situation is Tom Danousias, 23, from south west London, who was also made redundant this week.

""I was in the office and they sent a HR person who informed me I have to go home because of the coronavirus,"" he says.

Mr Danousias, who worked for a company selling products to the hospitality sector, said: ""I feel really bad because I don't know how I'm going to survive the next three or four months.

""I pay £800 for rent and bills. I have got savings. I calculated it and it will last two months maximum.""

Image copyright Tom Danousias Image caption Mr Danousias received a dismissal letter from HR on Wednesday

Business consultant Bob Donelan, 58, from Rye in Sussex, says he is expecting to be unemployed for around six months.

He does contract work, with his current contract due to run out at the end of March. He says there's a ""perfect storm"" of coronavirus - plus planned (but now postponed) changes for self-employed workers - which will make life harder for contractors.

""We have rent to pay,"" he says. ""I have estimated [we can afford to live] for four to five months. I'm not even in the gig economy, who must be looking at week for week.

""So it's just a case of hunkering down and not spending.""

For James Godwin, a final-year university student, the money he would have made from his Easter holiday restaurant job was going to help him learn to drive to help with his future job prospects. ""It's really restricted the sort of job I can apply for,"" he says.

""Due to customers dropping they don't need me anymore so they told me not to bother coming in,"" says Mr Godwin, 21, from Oxford studying at the University of York.

Image copyright James Godwin Image caption James says he initially felt ""like I was on my own"", before friends were also made redundant

""I've lost £1,200 because of that in wages, which is a lot considering I am a student who is still privately renting for a flat in York I no longer need.

""It's upsetting to lose that much money and it's been very stressful,"" he says.

'I applied at 7pm and was hired by 10pm'

While many firms have announced job cuts in recent days, supermarkets have been bucking the trend and have gone on a hiring spree to recruit tens of thousands more staff - and quickly.

Student Tracy Landu, 24, says hours at her university library had been cut back completely as the coronavirus outbreak meant fewer people were on campus.

She submitted a brief online application for a temporary customer service role at a Tesco store in north London at 19:00 GMT on Friday.

Image copyright Tracy Landu Image caption Student Tracy Landu says she decided to take things into her own hands

""It was really quick, I didn't put too much detail - I didn't actually upload a full CV - I just thought 'no, I'm not going to upload it'. I just knew they were quite desperate so the main details should be good [enough].""

By 22:00 she was phoned back by the store and - after a two-minute telephone interview - asked to attend her induction on Saturday.

""I spoke to a girl next to me who was called up at 09:00 for training at 12:00,"" she said.

""I was only on a short-term contract [at the university library] as I'm a student in my final year,"" she added.

""It made me think 'these hours aren't certain' and I decided to take things into my own hands and get money coming in.""

Chains including Tesco, Asda, Aldi, and Lidl said they would hire thousands of staff after hugely increased demand saw shoppers clearing shelves.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged businesses to ""stand by your employees"", following a £350bn package for businesses by Chancellor Rishi Sunak.

Mr Sunak also announced the government will pay some of the wages of workers employed by private companies.

For more than 35 years, The People's Kitchen in Newcastle has opened its doors to rough sleepers and vulnerable people.

Based in a former church, tables for up to 120 diners sit in-between floor-to-ceiling beams, with a professional kitchen at the back - once the heartbeat of the operation.

But today it is all empty.

Instead, the charity's dedicated volunteers serve hot soup, sandwiches, cakes and pastries from tables in the car park. In the evening, it is hot food from a catering van.

This has become the new reality as coronavirus cases rise across the UK, in an attempt to keep supplying food to the neediest while minimising the risk of spread.

Many soup kitchens in the local area - particularly church-run ones - have already closed.

Image copyright People's Kitchen Image caption The People's Kitchen has begun to operate in the car park

The People's Kitchen estimates it has lost up to 30% of its volunteer workforce, with all those over the age of 70 reluctantly asked to stay home.

One woman, Sophie - who says she spends her nights sleeping rough in a shop doorway - describes the service as her lifeline.

""I'm really scared,"" she says. ""Not many hostels are taking people in because of the virus, and I've got nowhere to stay this evening. No family I can turn to.

""I'd love to be put somewhere, anywhere - even a derelict building.

""If this place [The People's Kitchen] gets closed down, I don't know what I'm going to do.""

Sophie has been given baby wipes by the volunteers to help keep herself clean during the day, and is able to shower there too - although the service is limited amid increased cleaning.

She is being regularly supported by the charity's welfare team, but says the outbreak is taking a toll on her mental health.

""I'm low to start with, and this is making it worse. I can't sleep at the moment.

""The doctor has given me anti-depressants, but I don't know what I'd do if the chemist was shut.""

Rough sleepers are thought to be more at risk of contracting the virus, with many having underlying health conditions.

Kalpana Sabapathy, an NHS GP and clinical epidemiologist, says malnutrition and exposure to the elements reduce the effectiveness of the immune system.

Many also have ""vulnerabilities that age them prematurely"", she says. Some have HIV and TB, while drug and alcohol use can also be a factor.

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has announced £3.2m of initial emergency funding to help local authorities provide accommodation and services to rough sleepers who need to self-isolate.

""Public safety and protecting the most vulnerable people in society from coronavirus is this government's top priority,"" he said.

It is a move welcomed by the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales. But there are also calls for government to go further.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rough sleepers in London

A group of charities that run hostels across the UK is warning that such accommodation is becoming a ""Petri dish"" for the virus.

Centrepoint's policy director Balbir Chatrik says more must be done to test those living there - with many in dormitories, and others sharing bathroom and kitchen facilities.

The charity also subsidises the work of hostels, but Ms Chatrik says its income has already fallen since the outbreak due to a loss of money gained through fundraising - which has left her ""really worried"" regarding the impact on such accommodation.

She adds she has also heard reports of homeless individuals being unable to access support from at least one local authority because, while assessments are now being conducted over the phone, calls were going unanswered.

Using now-empty hotels

As part of an initial trial this weekend, 300 rooms are being offered by hotels in London to homelessness charities, with the aim to protect rough sleepers from the spread of the virus.

According to Matt Downie, the director of policy at the charity Crisis, without such steps it is ""impossible"" for the homeless community to self-isolate.

He believes student accommodation could also be used to house rough sleepers, as many rooms have washing facilities and could be used a self-contained space.

""The ideal outcome"", he adds, is something that is already beginning to take place in Glasgow - moving rough sleepers into furnished flats.

Not only does this enable them to self-isolate if needed, he says, it also potentially solves the issue of them being homeless.

In Newcastle, The People's Kitchen is determined to keep its services running for as long as possible.

It helps other vulnerable people too, like Andy - who has found the local food bank closed.

And Chanel, who says, if such services weren't available, ""I couldn't afford anything"".

Its volunteers say the community response has been ""fantastic"", but admit that if just one person attended with symptoms of coronavirus, it could drastically affect their capacity to operate.

They continue to serve food with a smile and conversation. But with the outbreak expected to last for months, it is sadly hard to imagine The People's Kitchen operating from its actual kitchen any time soon."

Shoppers are being told to buy only what they need, following shortages caused by panic buying.

So, what can be done to get supplies back into stores?

How many people are panic buying?

Empty shelves in the UK's supermarkets have become a common sight.

The increase in demand has been similar to that seen at Christmas, according to Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary George Eustice.

It has caused shortages of many products, including:

anti-bacterial products including hand sanitiser

toilet roll and tissues

long-life milk

pasta

tinned vegetables

rice

soap

cleaning products

pain relief

""There is £1bn more food in people's houses than there was three weeks ago, so we should make sure we eat some of it,"" said head of the British Retail Consortium, Helen Dickinson.

What is the government doing about panic buying?

Retailers say they have enough food and groceries to go round, but they are struggling to get items into stores as fast as people are buying them

Rules have been relaxed by the government to allow supermarkets to work together.

This means they can share resources, such as distribution depots, delivery vans and staff, as well as co-ordinating stock levels across the country.

Rules around drivers' hours have been eased and the 5p plastic bag charge is being waived for online orders, to speed up deliveries.

Nevertheless, shortages remain common.

""Buying more than you need means that others may be left without,"" said Mr Eustice. ""As you shop think of those who are finishing their late shifts and need to pop to their local shops.""

How are supermarkets trying to stop panic buying?

The major supermarkets are imposing limits on how many of each item people can buy:

Tesco is limiting customers to three of any product, and only two of toilet roll and paracetamol

Sainsbury's says people can buy up to three of any grocery product and two of more popular items like toilet paper, soap and long-life milk

Asda will let people purchase up to three of any food, toiletry or cleaning product

Aldi is limiting customers to four of any product

Waitrose is allowing people to buy only three of any grocery product and two packets of toilet roll

What else is being done for customers?

On Thursday, Sainsbury's dedicated the first hour of opening in stores, apart from its Local shops, to elderly and vulnerable customers. It has since extended that to include NHS staff and social care workers.

Morrisons said on Sunday that it will introduce an ""NHS hour"" across all of its stores, where healthcare workers can shop for groceries between 07:00 and 08:00 from Monday to Saturday.

It is also taking on 500 staff from Marie Curie and CLIC Sargent charity shops to help the elderly and vulnerable in stores across Great Britain.

From Monday, all Waitrose shops will set aside a proportion of all basic food items from every delivery especially for NHS workers too.

Iceland has also been opening an hour early for elderly and vulnerable people, and Tesco is introducing a similar scheme.

Image copyright AFP

However, retail expert Katie Hardcastle, said supermarkets could still do more: ""A lot of elderly people need support with their shopping, or are not looking to go out at all, so I think that needs looking at.""

Many stores, including Tesco, Asda, Aldi, and Lidl have said they are hiring thousands of staff to meet the unprecedented demand. Some have shut cafes and deli counters to allow more staff to focus on restocking shelves.

Tesco has said it will introduce distancing measures at checkouts to reduce the risk of infection and Aldi is installing clear screens at all its checkouts.

Why there could soon be less choice

Several food retailers are ""drastically cutting"" the range of products they sell. They are also telling manufacturers to stop making some products to focus on those for which there is greatest demand.

For example, one retailer, which makes 60 kinds of sausages, will only produce a fraction of those.

And Morrisons has reduced its bakery lines from 17 to seven.

Are online deliveries holding up?

Online deliveries are being used by more people, but there are questions over how robust the systems are.

Ocado suspended its website and app after struggling with the number of bookings.

Some Tesco deliveries are not arriving in their scheduled time slot and others are not being delivered at all if the driver runs out of time.

Most major supermarkets have all their delivery slots booked up for at least the next couple of weeks.

Morrisons said it would increase its number of delivery slots by recruiting 2,500 extra pickers and drivers.

Sainsbury's says it is going to prioritise delivery slots for elderly and vulnerable people."

Manager Anthony Price closed the doors of the Bedford pub in Tunbridge Wells at 20:00 GMT. Staff took over £500 in their last hour and were forced to turn away dozens of people shortly before closing, he said.

The owners had considered closing earlier in the week, but had waited to receive the government order to close ""because we didn't know whether the insurance companies would cover us"".

""It was pay day for the staff today, so we wanted to make sure they got paid and made sure they were going to be alright for at least a month,"" he said.

Mr Price expects the pub to be closed for 12 weeks, but said it was ""all up in the air"".

Forcing pubs to close was the wrong decision, he said.

""I think the public are very resilient, especially the British, we are known for our stiff upper lip. I think, let the public decide what they want to do.

""If the older generation, the younger generation, they want to go to bars and restaurants, let them. At least give them the option.

""By me working, that's down to me, that's my risk. If the older generation want to come in for a beer, that's at their risk.

""I understand why they've done it and hopefully it brings a quicker resolution to the end of the virus, but I just think let people do what they want to do. It's locking people up for a minimum of 12 weeks, it is like prison.

It comes after further strict measures were announced by the prime minister to tackle the spread of the coronavirus in the UK. From Monday evening people must stay at home except for shopping for basic necessities, daily exercise, any medical need and travelling to and from work.

Image caption ""Historic"", ""bombshell"", ""astonishing"" and ""unprecedented"" are among the ways the Daily Mail describes the prime minister's new measures. The paper says the measures will probably be enforced for ""far longer"" than the initial three-week period outlined by the PM.

Image caption For the Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson's national address marks the ""end of freedom"". It says his ""sombre"" televised announcement was a shock but came after scientific advisers told him the NHS would collapse unless tougher measures were brought in immediately.

Image caption The Sun describes Mr Johnson's move as putting the UK ""under virtual house arrest for at least three weeks"". The tabloid reports that police fines for people not complying with the new measures could be as high as £1,000.

Image caption The Financial Times describes the move as ""bringing down the shutters"" on Britain. The paper says Boris Johnson's televised announcement of ""draconian measures"" came after days of mounting pressure for tougher action. Emergency legislation, expected to be enacted by Thursday night, would allow fines to be levied on people breaking the rules, the paper adds.

Image caption The i says Mr Johnson ""finally"" restricted people's movements after ministers ""threatened mutiny"". The paper summarises the very few reasons people are allowed to leave their homes - to buy food, to exercise, to help vulnerable people, and to travel to work if they cannot work from home.

Image caption An image of a packed London Underground train on the front page of the Metro is ""proof"", the paper says, that the previous social distancing measures ""weren't enough"". The paper describes the new measures as a ""dramatic escalation"" of the UK's efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The paper draws attention to Mr Johnson's message that the virus is the ""biggest threat this country has seen for decades"".

Image caption Mr Johnson's announcement that the UK is facing a ""national emergency"" came after days of being accused of ""sending mixed messages about what the public should do"", the Guardian says. But the PM ""escalated his language"" to urge people to comply with the new measures, the paper adds. ""You must stay at home,"" he said in his Downing Street broadcast to the nation.

Image caption The move is a ""near full lockdown of Britain,"" the Times says. In a departure from coronavirus, the paper also reports on Alex Salmond being cleared of sex assaulting nine women while he was Scotland's first minister.

The drastic measures announced by Boris Johnson to tackle coronavirus are reflected in dramatic headlines.

""End of freedom"", the Daily Telegraph declares. ""Britain shuts up shop"", the Daily Mail says. The Sun has a picture of a giant padlock on its front page, with the headline ""House arrest"". For the Daily Mirror, it's a ""national lockdown"".

As the Financial Times puts it, the prime minister has been forced to close Britain.

The Guardian says that, after days of being accused of sending mixed messages about what the public should do, Mr Johnson has significantly escalated his language.

The Mail says the move follows fury in government at the failure of sections of the public to follow the guidance on social distancing. According to the paper, the models for containing the virus require social contact to fall by 75% to be effective.

But data from the weekend showed that high street shoppers were down by only 30% - and the number visiting parks was triple that normally seen at this time of year.

Several papers also blame crowded scenes on the London Underground during Monday's morning rush hour. It was - the Metro says - proof that tough action was needed.

While there's widespread support for the measures, there's also a feeling that, as the i puts it, the prime minister dragged his heels.

The Spectator website says the government had not quite understood how many people were going to totally ignore the social distancing advice right up until a ban on leaving the house.

Stephen Glover, writing in the Mail, says it seemed as though every significant new measure had to be wrung from Mr Johnson, and came too late.

At times, Glover says, the natural desire to safeguard our liberties has collided with the advice he has proffered, leaving many of us confused and unsure as to what we were being asked to do.

Michael Deacon - in his sketch for the Telegraph - writes that for the last seven days, Mr Johnson had been politely ""advising"" the public to stay in and to avoid crowds. But, he adds, no police officer tiptoes up to a gang of criminals and murmurs: ""I say chaps, hate to butt in, but would you mind terribly not committing all these murders?""

There is also acknowledgement that, while the instruction to stay at home was necessary, it went against the prime minister's deepest instincts.

Leo McKinstry, writing in the Express, says the imposition of these rules will have been particularly difficult for Mr Johnson, who is an optimistic liberal at heart, with a deep suspicion of the big state. But he had no alternative, given how the disease is raging through our society, he adds.

Many point out the difficulties facing the police in enforcing the new rules.

For the Mail there are questions over how people will prove they are caring for someone, or if they absolutely cannot work from home.

UK cracks down hard

Image copyright Christopher Furlong/Getty Images

First it was advice, now it's an order. Boris Johnson has issued a stark message to the country: ""At this moment of national emergency... stay at home."" Speaking after the UK death toll reached 335, the prime minister introduced unprecedented restrictions on everyday life, meaning people must leave their house for one of only four reasons - to exercise once a day, to travel to and from work where ""absolutely necessary"", to shop for essential items, and to fulfil any medical or care needs.

Shops selling non-essential goods have been told to shut, along with libraries and children's playgrounds, and gatherings in public of more than two people who do not live together will be prohibited. The restrictions will be in place for at least three weeks and police will have the power to enforce them, including through fines. Read the prime minister's statement in full and get a more detailed breakdown of the new rules.

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg says it's still not quite the kind of total crackdown seen in other countries, at least not yet - no curfews, for example - and there will be a time on the other side of this crisis to analyse whether the government made the right decisions at the right time.

Latest worldwide

The World Health Organization says the pandemic is ""accelerating"", with more than 360,000 cases globally and more than 16,000 deaths. But WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was still possible to ""change the trajectory"" with rigorous testing and contact-tracing strategies.

Many other nations have now imposed lockdowns along the lines of that in the UK. France is strictly limiting physical exercise and closing outdoor markets, and South Africa's government is preparing for the worst. India is stopping all domestic flights, but there are particular fears surrounding one textile city.

In Italy, the worst-hit country, the latest daily increase in deaths was the smallest since last Thursday, raising hope that stringent restrictions on public life are starting to have an effect. The BBC's Sima Kotecha describes the haunting experience of Rome under lockdown.

In the US, where 481 people have died, state governors and city mayors are pleading for more help from the federal government. However, the BBC's Anthony Zurcher explains why the president may be having second thoughts about following suit with a large-scale lockdown.

Coronavirus is an economic emergency as well as health one, and our colleagues in BBC Business have pulled together the guidance on how to apply for government business support. Lots of measures have been announced, but still, freelance and self-employed people tell us they feel forgotten.

Companies are attempting to help in the fight against the disease. Carmakers are answering calls from governments to help make more ventilators and face masks, while several tech giants are teaming up to accelerate delivery of testing kits. At the opposite end of the economic scale, we meet some of the workers keeping our essential services running.

US-China contagion: The battle behind the scenes

By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent

It is clearly not a good time for the world and it is not a good time for relations between the US and China. President Donald Trump has repeatedly chosen to call the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"". The president and his secretary of state have both denounced China for its failings in the initial handling of the outbreak. Meanwhile, social media in China has spread stories that the pandemic has been caused by a US military germ warfare programme. But this is not just a war of words, something more fundamental is going on.

""But every time the fish extended its sharp spines on its fins - you can see it hooked on the beak here - it lodged itself firmly.

Overfishing has depleted numbers of wild fish, and fish farms meet much of the growing demand. Could we one day be eating ""fish"" grown from cells in a factory, as a number of start-ups are planning?

""Caviar is no longer a luxury good,"" says David Shenson who owns four fish farms in Sacramento, California, raising sturgeon for their eggs, better known as caviar.

Business is booming says Mr Shenson and he's not just being self-promotional: The global caviar market reached £670m ($854m) in 2018 and is expected to expand by close to 10% by 2025, according to market research firm Androit Market.

But the caviar market might have to rely more and more on farmed fish, the number of wild sturgeon in major river basins has declined by 70% over the last century, according to figures from the World Wildlife Fund.

Overfishing and global warming have long wreacked havoc on fish stocks, and a third of marine fish stocks are still being fished at biologically unsustainable levels, according to the UN.

Image copyright Sterling Caviar Image caption The global caviar market is worth around £670m a year

""Simply put, we are running out of fish,"" says Daniel Pauly, a professor of fisheries at the Institute of Oceans and Fisheries at the University of British Columbia. ""And the situation, the trend line, is getting worse every year.""

""Maybe centuries ago we could live off hunting for our food but we can't live off hunting today and fishing is hunting. The notion of hunting in the 21st century to feed 10 billion people is absurd.""

A handful of start-up firms think they might have the answer. They are experimenting with growing fish ""meat"" in the lab.

Mainly based in Silicon Valley with a couple in Europe and Asia, they have developed techniques to extract fish stem cells and grow them into commercial quantities of edible flesh.

Stem cells are a type of cell, found in embryos or adult creatures - which can grow into a number of different specialised cells. They can grow into the muscle cells which make up most the parts of fish people like to eat.

Image copyright Finless Foods Image caption Lab-grown fish could be an alternative ingredient for fish cakes and fishfingers

""Picture it like 3D printing, but we're 3D printing fish,"" explains Michael Selden, chief executive and co-founder of lab-grown fish start-up Finless Foods.

His company's faux fish will come out as ground fish as opposed to whole fillets because developing, from scratch, skin and bone and blood isn't yet feasible.

More Technology of Business

Finless Foods and similar start-ups haven't yet commercialised their products and they still require approval from regulators, so their fish might not be on the market for two or three years.

Wild Type, based in San Francisco, has similar ambitions, but it is focused on Pacific salmon. Making fish in a lab sounds like it could be pricey for both producer and consumer, but chief executive Justin Kolbeck hopes to make the fish affordable at some point.

Image copyright Wild Type Image caption Wild Type lab-grown salmon looks quite like the real thing

""Our goal is to eventually drive down the price of our salmon to have its price run lower than conventionally-harvested salmon.""

Shiok Meats in Singapore has trained its eyes on lab-grown crustaceans such as shrimp.

It creates lab-grown fish by taking a small sample of stem cells from a real shrimp and growing them in large quantities in a large bioreactor chamber, similar to the huge stainless steel tanks brewers use to manufacture beer.

The tanks maintain a constant pressure and temperature and bathe the cells in gases and a nutrient-rich liquid. After a couple weeks the meat is ready.

""[It's] the same meat that would have come from a slaughtered animal but with no animal slaughter in this case,"" say Sandhya Sriram, chief executive and co-founder of Shiok Meats.

The company plans to launch its minced shrimp product in 2021, distributing it first in Singapore and then across East Asia.

He is excited about dubbing his firm's product ""clean meat"" due to the lack of antibiotics and lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions, compared to traditional farming.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A third of fish stocks are being fished at levels that are not sustainable

However, the environmental claims have yet to be fully verified.

While cell-based meats have a smaller carbon footprint than traditional protein sources, they will still require ""a lot"" of electricity, says Simon Somogyi, a professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.

""Where is that energy is coming from? Are they using carbonized or renewable energy?"" he asks.

Still, Mr Somogyi thinks lab-grown fish is perhaps an even more promising market than lab-grown beef.

""Fish has a better business case going forward than red meat because much of the volume of finned fish is turned into minced fish, and put into food such as fish fingers and fish burgers. Cell-based fish fits perfectly into that category.""

Wild Type's Mr Kolbeck envisions a future where fish lovers will have similar options to meat (and meat-alternative) eaters.

""From real meat to plant-based substitutes to cell-based meat... one company won't be the winner, but rather the winner will be increased choice and transparency in our food systems."""

On Thursday, the Ruby Princess cruise ship docked in Sydney with dozens of undiagnosed coronavirus cases onboard.

Almost 2,700 passengers - some coughing and spluttering - were allowed to leave the ship at Sydney Harbour, catching trains, buses and even overseas flights to get home.

More than 130 people from the cruise have now tested positive, making it the biggest single source of infections in Australia. One passenger died in hospital on Tuesday.

The saga has caused much anger: why was the ship allowed to dock and unload people?

What passengers were told

Passengers have vented their anger over how the situation was handled by ship operator Princess Cruises and Australian authorities.

Elisa McCafferty, an Australian woman who flew home to London with her husband immediately after disembarking, told the BBC: ""Nothing was said at anytime about anyone being sick onboard. It was a distinct lack of information coming through from Princess the entire time.""

She only learned of the danger while collecting her bags at Heathrow Airport.

""I turned on my phone and I started getting all these notifications from people back in Australia saying 'there's been confirmed cases on the Ruby,'"" she said.

""And I was just absolutely petrified. We had just been on two full flights - what if we had infected someone?""

She said she now had a dry cough, fever, body aches and fatigue - and they were self-isolating at home. They were also concerned about their elderly parents and friends who were on the trip too.

Image copyright ELISA MCCAFFERTY Image caption Elisa McCafferty and her husband believe they may have got sick on the ship

Other passengers recalled coming into contact with sick people on the boat and said there were no warnings.

""I think that they let us down,"" said Bill Beerens, a Sydney man who tested positive for the virus in hospital on the day he disembarked.

""I do honestly believe that they [cruise ship management] knew what was going on and they just wanted us off the boat,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Elderly couple Rona and Michael Doubrin said they had symptoms towards the end of the cruise but had not been concerned, because they had not been told to practice social distancing.

""People were going down to the pool, we were lying in the sun, eating in the dining room, dancing, seeing shows,"" Ms Doubrin told Daily Mail Australia.

""We would have isolated ourselves in the cabin if we'd known. We're not spring chickens - we're high risk.""

What happened in Sydney?

After an 11-day voyage, the ship returned to the city before dawn, cutting short its final New Zealand leg as the nation announced a travel ban.

At the time, according to NSW Health, about a dozen passengers reported feeling unwell and they had swabs taken for Covid-19. An ambulance took a passenger to hospital. (The woman, aged in her 70s, died on Tuesday, authorities said.)

But other passengers on board weren't told of this. Instead, thousands streamed off the boat at Circular Quay, just across from the Sydney Opera House. The bustling area leads directly into the city centre, with transit links to the airport and outer suburbs.

Five days earlier, Australia began ordering anyone returning from overseas to self-isolate for 14 days - a directive which applied to the cruise passengers.

But the Ruby Princess passengers weren't screened and were unmonitored when they left the ship. About a third were international passengers - they were told they could travel overseas immediately or self-isolate in Sydney for a fortnight.

""They even said, you can get a train home,"" said Ms McCafferty.

New South Wales health officials have said they followed national guidelines which allow passengers to disembark if the route is considered ""low risk"". The Ruby Princess was given that status because it had been to New Zealand only.

One day after the ship docked, officials revealed the first cases of Covid-19 confirmed in three people who had been on board - two passengers and a crew member.

It prompted a scramble to track down everyone else who had been on board.

And at least 21 of the 48 people who had tested positive by Monday were found in other Australian states. By Tuesday, the total number of cases linked to the ship had climbed to 133.

How did this happen?

It is hardly the first cruise ship to see infections - the Diamond Princess, also operated by Princess Cruises, drew global focus in February. Its passengers were quarantined for almost a month off the coast of Japan before being repatriated. More than 600 cases were linked to the ship.

Governments at Australia's state and federal level have pointed blame at each other. Princess Cruises has said it followed official guidelines.

On Saturday, The Australian newspaper reported that the ship had logged 158 ill passengers on its previous voyage to New Zealand. Nine people were tested upon arrival in Sydney on 8 March - and their tests results came back negative. However, two passengers from that journey were found to have tested positive after flying home to Darwin.

NSW port and health authorities declined to reply to BBC questions about these reports.

What have authorities said?

On Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the mistake as the responsibility of state officials.

NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard told reporters on Saturday: ""With the benefit of what we now know... I'd have said 'yeah, maybe we should hold them on the ship.'""

But he rejected Canberra's accusations that state officials had not properly checked cruise ships upon entry.

""New South Wales is actually going over and above what the national guidelines are,"" said Mr Hazzard.

State health officials stressed they had run assessments ""well beyond federal requirements"" for 63 ships which have entered the harbour since mid-February.

Others noted that while Canberra had enacted a ban on cruise ships arriving, it had allowed four including the Ruby Princess to be exempt.

Four other cruise ships into Sydney have been linked to confirmed Covid-19 cases. The Ovation of the Seas ship, which docked in Sydney a day before the Ruby Princess, has seen five positive tests.

Health officials say infected patients are in self-isolation or in hospital. All passengers have been told to quarantine themselves.

In the wake of the Ruby Princess bungle, Western Australia on Monday questioned where it would allow a cruise ship to dock there. The European ship Magnifica is carrying 1,700 passengers - about 250 of whom are reported to have respiratory illnesses.

It was allowed to dock on Tuesday to refuel, but all on board were banned from disembarking.

Premier Mark McGowan had stressed: ""I will not allow what happened in Sydney to happen here."""

Pride in London is the latest event to be postponed during the coronavirus outbreak.

It is the UK's biggest LGBT pride festival, with organisers estimating the 2019 parade was attended by more than 1.5 million people.

More than 100 Pride events have now been cancelled or postponed.

Pride in London told the BBC it was ""hopeful"" a celebration would be held before the end of the year.

This year's event was due to take place on 27 June.

Conversations about new dates for the full range of Pride in London events are ongoing, with the Greater London Authority, Westminster City Council, Metropolitan Police, Transport for London and London Fire Brigade all involved in talks.

Alison Camps and Michael Salter-Church, co-chairs of Pride in London, said it was a ""tough decision"" to postpone the event and they had done so following the advice from Public Health England and the government.

""With the climate changing daily, we need to think even further ahead and make timely decisions to protect the health and wellbeing of our communities, volunteers and participants,"" they said.

With large pride celebrations such as Pride Edinburgh, LA Pride and Tokyo Pride being removed from this year's calendar, some LGBT leaders are concerned their communities may suffer.

Kristine Garina, president of the European Pride Organisers Association, said it is ""heart breaking"" so many people will miss out on celebrating this year.

""Every Pride organiser in the world has a story of someone whose life was changed by coming to a Pride,"" she said.

""We will work together, and do all we can, to help Pride organisers get through this."""

Lisa is one of a number of young women who have told the BBC they have been pressured into acts of violence in the bedroom.

She says she willingly ""got together"" with a guy she ""kind of knew"" at a house party but was shocked when he began repeatedly biting down on her body.

""When he pulled his mouth away, his teeth were still clenched. I thought he was going to tear chunks out of my skin,"" she says.

Lisa, which is not her real name, said there was no conversation beforehand about whether she wanted to be bitten and she was physically shocked by it.

She says she was crying and asked him to stop ""but there's only so much you can do when somebody is a lot larger and stronger than you are"".

Online culture is changing behaviour in the bedroom and what was once regarded as strictly fetish is rapidly becoming the norm.

BBC Disclosure and BBC 5Live commissioned a survey of 2,049 UK men aged 18 to 39 to assess how so-called ""rough sex"" was being navigated.

In the survey, 71% of the men who took part said they had slapped, choked, gagged or spat on their partner during consensual sex.

One-third (33%) of the men who had done this said they would not ask verbally whether their partner would like them to do it either before or during sexual activity.

Which of the following have you performed during consensual sexual activity? British men aged 18-39

What is driving this interest in so-called ""rough sex""? Our survey of young men pointed to a big factor - pornography.

More than half of the men (57%) who had said they had slapped, choked, gagged and spat on partners said pornography had influenced their desire to do so.

One in five (20%) said it had influenced them a ""great deal"".

A man called George - not his real name - told the BBC Disclosure programme A Question of Consent that he had tried choking and slapping during sex.

""You see it in porn and think, 'oh, that looks class' and you try it,"" he says.

However, George says it can be disappointing when re-enacting what you watch on free pornography sites.

""It never turns out the way it looks in porn,"" he says. ""Obviously, they are actors, even though you watch and you like it, when you try it in real life you are disappointed quite a lot.""

To what extent do you think pornography influenced you? All respondents who ""have performed"" slapping, choking, gagging or spitting

Dr Fiona Vera-Gray, from Durham University, researches the clips, titles and thumbnails found on the front pages of the world's most popular free pornography sites.

She says she found evidence on the first page of the sites of all kinds of videos that would not be allowed to be uploaded under their stated terms and conditions.

Dr Vera-Gray says she even found evidence of videos that ""promote, endorse or glorify sexual violence, such as rape"".

She says: ""Porn has changed the landscape of what's going on for kids and so if you think your 12-year-old hasn't seen pornography, I'd really question that.""

BBC Disclosure approached the most popular free pornography sites for an interview. None agreed.

Lisa, who is in her 20s, told the programme how she felt after her encounter.

""I was just in shock,"" she says.

She says she felt a bit guilty because she had ""gotten with him"".

""Could I have done more? Could I have said more? Could I have left?"" she says.

She asks herself: ""Did you do enough to stop it?""

Brenna Jessie, from Rape Crisis Scotland, says that feelings of guilt are really common among victims of abuse.

""I think there will be a lot of women who have consented to sex but who have not consented to violence who won't necessarily recognise their experience or understand their experience to be sexual violence,"" she says.

Ms Jessie believes that society is to blame for those feelings.

""We live in a society that really shames victims and blames them for not doing more to keep themselves safe rather than asking the perpetrators - or the people, who have committed these acts - why they have done that?""

http://www.bbc.com/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51979690,2020-03-23T00:10:21,How Marsha Hunt fought Hollywood blacklisting,"It's 70 years since Red Channels was published in the USA - a directory of writers, actors and producers alleged to be communists or communist sympathisers. The red scare ended many careers. Now 102, actress Marsha Hunt is almost the last person still alive named in the book.

Marsha Hunt never wanted to do anything except act. Born in 1917, she grew up in New York City and remembers going to the theatre with her father when she was five.

""It was a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta - probably HMS Pinafore. I turned to my dad and I said I'm going to do that. After that if there was a play I was always in it,"" she says.

Hunt was in her late teens when she went to Hollywood looking for a film career. She found success quickly: her first film was The Virginia Judge in 1935.

She was constantly in work and seemed to have a long career ahead of her - although few of her early films are familiar today. An exception is the 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice with Laurence Olivier.

She still regrets a near miss with the classic Gone with the Wind. ""For about a weekend it appeared I'd been cast as Melanie, who's Scarlett O'Hara's cousin. Then an executive changed his mind and I lost the role. When I went to Hollywood I'd been warned I would have my heart broken and losing Melanie was that moment.""

But before she was 30 Marsha Hunt had made more than 40 films. Producers valued her attractive and intelligent screen presence.

In 1945 she was asked to join the board of the Screen Actors Guild and for the first time her politics came under scrutiny.

Image copyright Frederick M. Brown Image caption Hunt was pictured at The Art of the Movie Poster exhibition in 2010

""I was proud to be asked. To have a voice in what would affect all screen actors was dazzlingly important to me,"" she says. But Cold War tension was building with the Soviet Union and anyone suspected of left-wing sympathies was open to attack.

Hollywood, radio and TV came under suspicion. The political pressure came from HUAC - the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities.

In 1947, HUAC summoned 10 writers to Washington to testify. Each was asked if he was a communist and all ultimately went to prison for refusing to answer or to name other communists.

Marsha's problems with the authorities may have begun when she joined the Committee for the First Amendment - a group of liberal actors who supported the Hollywood Ten. Among those who flew to Washington were Danny Kaye, Gene Kelly and John Huston. Also there were Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, married and the biggest stars Warner Bros had.

""We were a brigade to defend those who'd been blacklisted or were under suspicion,"" Hunt remembers. ""We were serious citizens trying to set Washington straight: we were not a bunch of Reds. We were headed by the Bogarts so we were a pretty spiffy team.

""We made our speeches and did a radio programme called Hollywood Fights Back and came home thinking we'd been patriots and had defended our profession. If there were some communists among us that was their business and not ours.

""I knew nothing about communism but I just thought that as it was a legal party other people had the right to join the darned thing if they wanted to. But it was a time of hysteria and all of us who spoke out against blacklists were punished in some way or other. There was a very strong right wing in the movie business.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hunt says she ""certainly lost a lot of jobs as the blacklist tightened""

Stars who'd supported the committee quickly came under huge pressure from studio bosses to recant and Humphrey Bogart declared that his support had been a mistake.

Hunt remembers that turnabout with sadness. ""I'm sorry to say but it can only be cowardice. That's a terrible word to use about the Bogarts but why else would they do that? We all went to Washington to defend other people's rights. It was a time of people really turning quite ugly.""

She says it's hard to judge how far her career was damaged at first. But in 1950 her name and 150 others appeared in Red Channels, a 200-page book published as an adjunct to Counterattack - The Newsletter of Facts to Combat Communism. The book was subtitled: ""The report of communist influence in radio and television."" Inclusion was enough to damage or in some cases terminate a career.

Those named included composers Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland and Marc Blitzstein, actors Lee J Cobb and Jose Ferrer and the writers Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman. Today the only survivor apart from Hunt is Walter Bernstein, who's 100. (In 1976 Walter Bernstein wrote the film The Front about the blacklist era.)

Hunt insists that in 1950 she never even saw Red Channels. ""I guess I was a star but I was never sizzlingly hot as a Hollywood property for hire. But I certainly lost a lot of jobs as the blacklist tightened.

""We live, we proudly insist, in a free country. By that was meant, I was sure, that you were free to your opinions and actions if they didn't break any law. The anti-Reds were fighting Americans' freedoms. I didn't know the first thing about communism - never studied it, never learned about it. I must have known a few communists but I didn't care - that was their business, not mine.""

To continue to work on screen her agent persuaded her to write out a statement of her beliefs. ""It was an anti-communist declaration and he said without it I would never clear my name. Gradually it changed things for me in Hollywood but my work and reputation never returned to how they were.""

Hunt says she was never at the top of anyone's list of people to attack. ""But there were actors I worked with and liked who were or had been communists. I'd been seen in the company of so-and-so and that was enough.

""Suddenly to have the dirtiest word in the American language - communist - held against me was an outrage. And I had no way to end it or fight back.""

After 1950 screen credits were mainly limited to TV but she was happy to appear in George Bernard Shaw's play The Devil's Disciple on Broadway, where the power of the blacklist was less absolute. Other stage-work followed.

By the '60s she was working primarily for charitable and humanitarian causes although occasional screen credits continued. Though she largely disappeared from public view she was pleased when director Roger Memos made the documentary Marsha Hunt's Sweet Adversity, which is introducing her to the online generation.

""Many younger people know little about the Hollywood blacklist,"" she says. ""Sometimes I'm asked if it could ever happen again. I hope America learned from what happened all those years ago. But how can you ever be sure?"""

The 2020 Olympic Games will be postponed by one year because of coronavirus, says International Olympic Committee member Dick Pound.

It comes after the chairman of the British Olympic Association said Great Britain would be unlikely to send a team to Tokyo this summer.

Australia and Canada have already said they will not compete in Japan.

""On the basis of the information the IOC has, postponement has been decided,"" Pound told USA today.

""The parameters going forward have not been determined, but the Games are not going to start on 24 July, that much I know.""

The International Olympic Committee has given itself four weeks to decide on the future of this summer's Games, but veteran IOC member Pound says a decision will be announced soon.

""It will come in stages,"" he said.

""We will postpone this and begin to deal with all the ramifications of moving this, which are immense.""

'We will be joining Canada and Australia'

Canada and Australia had already announced their decision to withdraw from this summer's Games when the chairman of the British Olympic Association, Hugh Robertson, said he expected Britain to be ""joining shortly"".

""We can't see any way that this can go ahead as things are constituted,"" said Robertson. ""I expect we will be joining Canada and Australia shortly.""

As of Sunday, there had been 5,683 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United Kingdom, with 281 deaths.

The UK government has urged the public to follow advice on social distancing, with MPs debating stricter measures to ensure people comply.

""I think it is very simple. If the virus continues as predicted by the government, I don't think there is any way we can send a team,"" Robertson told Sky Sports News.

""First, I don't see any way that the athletes and Team GB could be ready by then. Elite training facilities are perfectly understandably and quite correctly closed around the country, so there is no way they could undertake the preparation they need to get ready for a Games.

""Secondly, there is the appropriateness of holding an Olympic Games at a time like this. We are actually in a process where we are talking to all our sports. We will complete that over the next couple of days.

""We have already said to the IOC (International Olympic Committee) that we think their four-week pause is absolutely the right thing to do.""

On Sunday, Canada became the first major country to withdraw from this summer's Olympics and Paralympics.

The Canadian Olympic and Paralympic committee said it had taken ""the difficult decision"" to pull out after consulting athletes, sports groups, and the government.

It then ""urgently called"" on the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee and the World Health Organization to postpone the Games for a year.

""It's clear the Games can't be held in July,"" Australia chef de mission Ian Chesterman said on Monday.

""Our athletes have been magnificent in their positive attitude to training and preparing, but the stress and uncertainty has been extremely challenging for them.""

The IOC has said postponement is in its ""scenario planning"". The cancellation of the Tokyo 2020, due to run from 24 July to 9 August, is ""not on the agenda"", but a ""scaled-down"" Games is also being considered.

Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe told his country's parliament on Monday that a postponement would be unavoidable if the event cannot be held in a complete way.

'Neither feasible or desirable'

Media playback is not supported on this device The 2020 Summer Olympic Games are still scheduled to start in July.

World Athletics president Lord Coe has called for this summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo to be postponed.

In a letter to IOC president Thomas Bach, Coe says an Olympics in July 2020 is ""neither feasible or desirable"" because of the coronavirus crisis.

In his letter to Bach, which followed a conference call between himself and area presidents of the Olympic federations, Briton Coe said: ""No-one wants to see the Olympic Games postponed but, as I have said publicly, we cannot hold the event at all costs, certainly not at the cost of athlete safety.

""A decision on the Olympic Games must become very obvious very quickly. I believe that time has come and we owe it to our athletes to give them respite where we can.""

In his letter, the double Olympic 1500m champion listed three main reasons for delaying the 2020 Games:

Competition fairness - ""Every one of my area presidents believes that we can no longer expect a fair and level playing field in our sport given the number of athletes who are struggling to train in various countries due to measures put in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus.""

- ""Every one of my area presidents believes that we can no longer expect a fair and level playing field in our sport given the number of athletes who are struggling to train in various countries due to measures put in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus."" Risk of injury - ""If athletes are unable to train properly now we both know, as we have both been there, they will push themselves even harder closer to an Olympic Games, which will increase the propensity for injury.""

- ""If athletes are unable to train properly now we both know, as we have both been there, they will push themselves even harder closer to an Olympic Games, which will increase the propensity for injury."" Emotional wellbeing of athletes - ""The uncertainty of the Olympic Games happening in July and the inherent desire and motivation to excel that resides in all our athletes is causing real anguish that we can, collectively, put a stop to.""

The subject of athlete welfare was also highlighted by Japanese Olympic Committee president Yasuhiro Yamashita, who told reporters on Monday that too long of a delay to Tokyo 2020 would be a burden to athletes preparing for the games.

In his own letter, addressed to athletes and published on Sunday, Bach said the IOC is ""in a dilemma"" and ""a final decision about the date of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 now would still be premature"".

The German added that to postpone the Games ""is an extremely complex challenge"" and that a cancellation would ""destroy the Olympic dream of 11,000 athletes"".

In terms of a postponement, Bach warned: ""A number of critical venues needed for the Games could potentially not be available any more.

""The situations with millions of nights already booked in hotels is extremely difficult to handle, and the international sports calendar for at least 33 Olympic sports would have to be adapted. These are just a few of many, many more challenges.""

UK Athletics, its US counterpart, and several national Olympic governing bodies have urged the IOC in recent days to delay the Games."

Uefa could authorise one-legged knockout matches for some Champions League and Europa League ties after postponing the finals of all this season's major competitions.

With European football suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic, there was no possibility of the competitions reaching their scheduled conclusion at the end of May.

It is still hoped to play the respective finals on 27 June and 24 June, potentially at the end of mini tournaments to be played in Istanbul and Gdansk.

The Women's Champions League final - originally scheduled for 24 May - has also been postponed.

There is no guarantee of these matches taking place though and work is now being undertaken to try to work out a formula that would allow the competitions to reach a conclusion.

One obvious difficulty is that matches in the men's competitions are at different stages and countries may be allowed to restart professional football at different times.

In the Champions League, four last-16 ties have been concluded, while the second legs of the other four are still to take place. In the Europa League, six first-leg ties have been played but two remain outstanding.

While it is hard to see Uefa ruling out the second legs of ties that have already started, they may be willing to let the ones that have not - both involving Spanish sides playing Italian ones - be decided by a single game, with the venue to be decided by the toss of a coin.

Quarter-finals and semi-finals could also be played over a single game.

It has already been agreed that European club matches could be played on a weekend and it is also understood there is no longer any imperative for the Champions League to be the last club game of the season, raising the possibility of the qualifying rounds for the 2020-21 tournament beginning before the major leagues have concluded."

""It is planned to reschedule the quarter-finals, semi-finals and Marseille finals,"" a statement said.

The quarter-finals of both competitions, scheduled for the first weekend of April, had already been called off, with all rugby union across the continent currently on hold.

European rugby organisers say they will work with the leagues in order to ""restructure a conclusion to its season as part of a wider rescheduling of the remainder of the season in Europe"".

A statement added: ""All contingencies are underpinned by the requirement to protect the health and welfare of players, club staff, match officials, supporters and the wider rugby community.

""It is planned to reschedule the quarter-final and semi-final matches, as well as the Marseille finals, in line with fixtures in the professional league competitions, subject to advice from government and local authorities.""

The Rugby Football Union (RFU) ended the season for all levels below the top-flight on Friday.

There has been no professional sport in England since 15 March, while there has been no top-flight rugby union in England since the weekend before.

Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Robertson, Gomez, Van Dijk, Fabinho, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Mane, Firmino, Salah.

Liverpool's first-choice starting XI are already on their way to iconic status courtesy of performances over the past two seasons, including a stunning run of form to go more than a year unbeaten and lead the Premier League by a massive 25 points in 2019-20.

Would it surprise you, then, to learn that the 1-0 defeat at Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie in February was the first time this side had started a game together?

It is not such a unique phenomenon, though. Some of the most iconic starting XIs in football history barely ever began a game together.

Injuries, suspensions and, more recently, squad rotation, along with perhaps a bit of misremembering on our part, all contribute to make some of football's most revered sides no more than a myth.

The Premier League era is awash with them. There are, of course, also notable examples from pre-1992 in England.

One such case is the one which inspired this piece - that the iconic Don Revie Leeds side of the late 1960s and early 70s started just one game together.

But before we have a look at the more recent examples - and seeing as we are in what was supposed to be an international break - let's have a look at arguably England's most iconic XI.

Some people are on the pitch...

Beating West Germany 4-2 to win the 1966 World Cup earned this line-up legendary status but they actually only played together six times.

One of the chief reasons they started so few games together is Jimmy Greaves - the forgotten man of that World Cup triumph.

Geoff Hurst scored a hat-trick in the final but he probably would not have featured in the game at all had Greaves - the country's all-time leading scorer at the time - not been injured in the last of the group games, against France.

This opened the door to Hurst, who scored the only goal in the quarter-final win over Argentina, kept his place for the semi-final with Portugal and got the nod from boss Alf Ramsey for the final, despite Greaves being fit.

That final XI would play three more games after the World Cup before Greaves was restored and players like Alan Mullery and Brian Labone came to greater prominence.

They were undefeated as a side and went out in style with a 5-1 win over Wales in a qualifier for the 1968 European Championship.

Golden boys?

How about a more recent, famous incarnation of the England side - the country's supposed ""Golden Generation""?

They never once started an international together.

This is mainly due to Rio Ferdinand's suspension in 2004 for missing a drugs test, which kept him out of that year's European Championship finals in Portugal, followed by Paul Scholes' retirement from international football immediately after that tournament.

But even if you replace Ferdinand with Sol Campbell, this XI only started four games.

Fergie time

Moving on to the Premier League and we'll start with the side that dominated the newly-branded division's initial seasons - Sir Alex Ferguson's early-1990s Manchester United.

Solid at the back, with grit in the middle, pace and trickery out wide and a mixture of flair and finishing up top, this iteration of United won two Premier League titles in three years, one forming part of a Double in 1993-94. But the above XI would start just six league games - winning them all.

Man Utd XI 1993-95 league games together Opponents Date Venue Score Tottenham 15/01/1994 White Hart Lane 1-0 Everton 22/01/1994 Old Trafford 1-0 QPR 05/02/1994 Loftus Road 3-2 Sheffield Wednesday 16/03/1994 Old Trafford 5-0 Leeds 27/04/1994 Elland Road 2-0 Ipswich 01/04/1994 Portman Road 2-1

Extended to cup games, this becomes 12 matches. Unsurprisingly and no doubt part of the reason behind their status, they did not lose a single game, only drawing one - the 1993 Community Shield with Arsenal, which they won on penalties.

The likes of Bryan Robson, Brian McClair and Lee Sharpe played a significant role during that time, with Eric Cantona's suspension for attacking a fan at Crystal Palace disrupting the side before Andrew Cole's arrival and Mark Hughes' departure signalled the end of it.

Interestingly, the side that preceded this, which has McClair in place of Roy Keane and Sharpe on the right instead of Andrei Kanchelskis, is the XI that has started the most games in Premier League history.

They played together 19 times in total.

Another United side of the Premier League era is arguably even more iconic and also more of a myth - the club's revered Treble winners of 1998-99, who remarkably started just one single league game together (a 1-0 win at Coventry on 20 February 1999) and two matches in total, the other being the Champions League quarter-final first-leg win over Inter Milan.

Injuries meant Giggs was in and out of the side that season, with Jesper Blomqvist his regular deputy, while the squad was replete with alternate talent in the likes of Phil Neville, Henning Berg, Nicky Butt, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

Invincibles?

The Arsenal side that went a whole season unbeaten in 2003-04 is one of the most iconic of the Premier League era.

Would it surprise you to learn that this side started only two league games together for the Gunners?

The two matches in question give us just a small glimpse of the potency that side possessed - both wins, one to put a major rival to the sword, the other to seal that undefeated season.

Arsenal 'Invincibles' league games together Opponents Date Venue Score Liverpool 09/04/2004 Highbury 4-2 Leicester 15/05/2004 Highbury 2-1

It is easy to forget that Ray Parlour played a prominent role that season, starting 16 of their league games, as did Edu, who began 13 of them, while the likes of Sylvain Wiltord, Pascal Cygan and Jose Antonio Reyes chipped in.

The following season saw Gilberto Silva sidelined for seven months because of injury and the early rise to prominence of a young Cesc Fabregas.

Special ones?

It is harder to nail down iconic starting XIs the more recent you look, with managers increasingly rotating their sides to cope with the demands of the modern game.

Jose Mourinho had the luxury of a large, expensively assembled and talented squad at his disposal during his first spell at Chelsea, but this is the XI that probably springs to mind, particularly from that 95-point season in 2004-05.

Well, this XI never started a competitive game together. You can replace Bridge with Gallas at left-back or fast-forward a year and bring Michael Essien into midfield and push Cole into Duff's spot and it still doesn't have a match under its belt.

Before you know it you are swapping in and out Eidar Gudjohnsen, Tiago, Alexei Smertin, Geremi and Mateja Kezman and only succeeding in making the side less and less iconic."

England and Lyon defender Lucy Bronze has been named BBC Women's Footballer of the Year 2020.

Bronze, 28, has claimed the award for the second time, after winning in 2018.

""Winning a trophy twice is special because it's so much harder,"" she said.

Netherlands and Arsenal striker Vivianne Miedema came second and Reign FC's United States forward Megan Rapinoe third, as the award attracted the highest number of votes in its six-year history.

The other nominees on the five-player shortlist for the BBC World Service award were Australia and Chelsea striker Sam Kerr and USA and Chicago Red Stars midfielder Julie Ertz.

Bronze received her award at her home in Manchester

Bronze's 2019 included being named Uefa's Women's Player of the Year and finishing as runner-up in the women's Ballon d'Or, behind Rapinoe.

With her club she claimed a trophy treble, winning the French league and cup, as well as the Champions League, while with England she won the SheBelieves Cup and scored a memorable 20-yard strike as she helped the Lionesses reach the World Cup semi-finals.

""I look at the list of nominees for this award - before the public didn't maybe know as much about the players - and now I think: 'Everybody knows who these girls are',"" Bronze told BBC World Service from her home in Manchester, where she is staying during football's shutdown because of the coronavirus pandemic.

""That's definitely pretty special. Things have changed so much since the World Cup, and next year with a home Euros it's something that can change even more and get even bigger, especially for us in England.

""In the past two years I've changed so much as a person and a leader. I'd like to think my football has improved a bit - but as a person I've grown up a lot. I'm coming up to 30 so I have to.

""When I was younger I just wanted to play and win, but now I'm taking on a bigger role to help the team win at England and Lyon.""

As it stands for Bronze, 2020 would include representing Britain at the Olympics in Tokyo and then a European Championship in England in the summer of 2021.

Both tournaments are opportunities to continue the growth of the women's game, with interest and viewing numbers at an all-time high.

""I still say 2019 was one of my most disappointing years, purely because of the World Cup,"" said Bronze.

""But I'm starting to look back even now and saying I achieved a lot and had a really good year, probably an outstanding year in my career in terms of winning trophies.

""The World Cup really hit me hard, but it's motivated me to do more. I want to win something with the national team, whether that's with Great Britain or England. I'd swap all my individual awards just to get my hands on something like that."""
http://www.bbc.com/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/52006750,2020-03-23T19:50:32,Eddie Hearn predicts many fighters will have to leave boxing because of coronavirus crisis,"Boxing in Britain has been suspended until at least May

Many fighters will be forced to leave boxing because of the impacts of the coronavirus crisis, promoter Eddie Hearn has warned.

On Monday, the British Boxing Board of Control extended the suspension of events until May and a number of major fights have already been cancelled - and Hearn expects many boxers to have to get different jobs in the future.

""The coronavirus is going to have a massive impact on every business, particularly boxing,"" Hearn told the BBC Radio 5 Live Boxing podcast.

""If this drags on to September, October, November, December we will have fighters that have not boxed this year.

""The fighters at the top end are going to be fine but the fighters coming through, small hall fighters, ones starting their careers or those who do not have a sponsorship deal face big concerns.

""They will have to give up the sport of boxing and get a job and that's heartbreaking for someone trying to live their dreams.

""If there are no events, the companies are not making money and the athletes are not getting prize money. We will see a lot of fighters have to give up the sport of boxing at a lower level because there's no income. ""

'No chance of these Olympics taking place'

Hearn, whose Matchroom Boxing company promotes world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua and also produces shows around the world, feels these are uncertain times for every sport.

""We do not want people to leave the sport, we want the more fighters the better,"" said Hearn.

""But look at the Olympics, these people have grafted for four years to achieve their dream and fight in Tokyo.

Only three days of action at the Olympic boxing qualifying event were able to take place before it was suspended last week

""There's no chance of these Olympics taking place so what are they going to do? Everything is going to be a complete reshuffle of every sport.

""The Premier League moving back four months affects next season, the Euros have been cancelled, what will happen to the Olympic cycle? What will happen with our shows?

""We're delaying events in place and fighters are delaying their time to peak and earn, everyone is holding their breath to see how long this lasts - the message right now is do as people say.

""We hope to return to action in late or mid summer but no-one knows.""

'Some sports will not recover'

Hearn believes boxing will ""100% survive"", but not all the businesses or promoters connected with the sport will.

He said: ""If you don't run a sustainable business very quickly this is going to unfold on you like a ton of bricks.

""Things have gathered momentum and it's been changing to worrying about your business to worrying about your family - that's when the other stuff plays second fiddle.

""You realise the severity of this and it's about life and death rather than just running a business.

Matchroom Boxing promote shows around the world

""It's heartbreaking to see every sport suffer and some sports will never recover, some businesses will never recover but more importantly some people will never recover. When that's an issue everything stops and everything becomes insignificant.

""We will beat this, we must do as we're told but there will still be a future for this country, this sport and this economy.""

Having to be creative to survive

The impacts of the coronavirus pandemic have already seen Hearn cancel fights involving Sunderland welterweight Josh Kelly and also Newcastle lightweight Lewis Ritson.

Matchroom has major shows scheduled for 2 May in Manchester (Dillian Whyte v Alexander Povetkin - heavyweight), 9 May in Cardiff (Lee Selby v George Kambosos Jr - world lightweight title eliminator) and 23 May in London (Oleksandr Usyk v Dereck Chisora - heavyweight).

British heavyweight Dillian Whyte is yet to fight in 2020 and is scheduled to be in action in May

""Everything has been moving non-stop,"" added Hearn. ""When it [coronavirus] first happened we looked into running shows behind closed doors, we spoke to the BBBofC they said the concern was the doctors would not be available, we might not get into the hospitals and it became a non-starter.

""We tried to create television shows, talkshows, but as it became more serious, this became impossible.

""It's about being creative, producing new content, new shows and having to consider the idea of studio shows and behind-closed-doors shows once the coast is clear - that may happen before the big arenas do.

""We have to make sure any fighter we have who is financially struggling is taken care of but we're lucky that a lot of fighters might have a monthly wage from us, a sponsorship deal or have earned enough money to be OK for four or five months.

""The ones lower down the scale are in big problems because they do not know when then are going to be fighting. This is a problem so deep, not just for fighters starting their career but also for darts players, snooker players, footballers starting out, cricketers.

""With the situation with the government and statutory pay, fighters can't go to the government and get 80% of their salary that does not exist.""

Will Joshua fight Fury next?

Joshua is due to defend his world titles against against Kubrat Pulev on 20 June at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, although Hearn has already said this could be moved back to July because Tottenham may be still playing Premier League matches then.

Asked whether, if the Pulev fight was cancelled, Joshua would then fight WBC world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury in the winter, Hearn replied: ""Right now our plan is to fight Pulev in June or July then fight Fury or whoever holds the WBC belt at the time.

""If the Pulev fight can't take place we may end up seeing that fight [against Fury] happen later this year.

""It wouldn't be ideal for AJ boxing in December to have been out for a whole year going into a fight like that but I don't think he would have a problem with it."""
http://www.bbc.com/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-51930856,2020-03-20T09:54:58,Is Iran covering up its outbreak?,"Iran is facing one of the largest coronavirus outbreaks in the world. Today, as families celebrate Persian New Year, Nowruz, there is concern the true scale of the virus is being downplayed by the government and could rapidly get much worse.

Mohammad has been working relentlessly since the coronavirus outbreak to save the lives of his patients. The hospital doctor, who works in the northern province of Gilan, has not seen his family for 14 days. He has lost colleagues. He has lost friends - including his former mentor, his teacher at medical school who recently fell victim to coronavirus.

""It's not just our hospital. The coronavirus outbreak has paralysed our whole health system,"" says Mohammad.

""The morale of staff is very low. Our families are so worried and we are under enormous pressure.""

Mohammad's name has been changed because speaking out against the government in Iran risks arrest. But several doctors from across the country's northern provinces have spoken to the BBC about the dire conditions they are facing, and how badly they think the government has handled the crisis.

""We don't even have enough masks. Our medical staff are dying on a daily basis,"" says Mohammad.

""I do not know how many people died but the government is trying to cover up the true scale of the crisis. They lied in the early days of the outbreak.""

In just 16 days, Covid-19 spread throughout all 31 provinces in Iran.

On top of this, 16 countries claim they have cases of the virus that originated in Iran. They are Iraq, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Pakistan, Georgia, Estonia, New Zealand, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Qatar and Armenia.

However, critics of the authorities say the government of Iran has continued to downplay the outbreak.

In its first announcement on 19 February, the government told people not to worry about the virus. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Iran's ""enemies"" of exaggerating the threat.

A week later, as the number of cases and deaths surged, President Hassan Rouhani echoed the Supreme Leader's words and warned against the ""conspiracies and fear-mongering of our enemies"". He said these were designed to bring the country to a standstill and urged Iranians to continue their everyday lives and carry on going to work.

Most recently, state-controlled TV programmes announced the coronavirus could be a US-manufactured ""bioweapon"", with the Supreme Leader tweeting about a ""biological attack"".

As of 20 March, nearly 1,300 people have died and nearly 18,000 people have been infected, according to the Iranian health ministry.

Iran is the third worst-hit country behind China and Italy.

Doctors from three of the worst-hit provinces in Iran - Gilan, Golestan and Mazandarn - have told the BBC that there are very few coronavirus testing kits, and medical supplies are limited - including basic medicines, oxygen tanks, sterilised masks, and protective scrubs and gloves.

Doctors are now having to kit out temporary field hospitals. One intensive care doctor described how her local football stadium was being equipped with beds to handle the overflow of patients.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some factories in the capital Tehran are now producing medical equipment 24 hours a day

Every doctor the BBC spoke to said that based on their experience, the official statistics must be much lower than the reality.

One doctor, an A&E medic from Golestan Province, says her hospital receives an average of 300 patients a day. She estimates that 60%-70% of those are infected with coronavirus, but due to lack of resources, only those who are critically ill are admitted.

And only those who are admitted to hospital are counted in the official statistics.

The doctor describes having lost five patients a day on average over the past two weeks. She says that often by the time someone has arrived with a coronavirus testing kit, her patient has already died.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Medical staff bring in another patient suspected of Coronavirus

Also devastating for medical staff is the loss of their own. Medical professionals said they had recently lost a number of colleagues.

One heartbreaking case was that of 25-year-old Narjes Khanalizadeh, a nurse from the northern city of Lahijan who died towards the end of February.

A photo of her went viral on social media. But the government denied she had died of Covid-19.

Image caption Narjes Khanalizadeh collapsed on 23 February and died two days later

State-controlled TV channels continued to portray an image of easy-going and fearless medical staff working on the front line, courageously battling the virus and saving their patients.

But shortly after her death, the Iranian Nursing Organisation confirmed Narjes had died of coronavirus.

How did the virus spread so fast?

According to the government, there were two ""patient zeros"", both of whom died in the city of Qom on 19 February. One, it said, was a businessman who contracted the disease in China.

Qom quickly became the epicentre of the outbreak.

The city is an important pilgrimage destination for Shia Muslims. It is home to the country's top Islamic clerics, and draws some 20 million domestic and around 2.5 million international tourists a year. Each week, thousands of pilgrims navigate the city, paying their respects by kissing and touching the numerous shrines and landmarks.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Imam Hasan Al-Askari Mosque in Qom has been closed since the outbreak

The virus spread quickly and the number of cases began to soar. But instead of quickly quarantining the city, representatives of the Supreme Leader - such as cleric Mohammad Saeedi - campaigned for pilgrims to keep on visiting.

""We consider this holy shrine to be a place of healing. That means people should come here to heal from both spiritual and physical diseases.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A masses kisses the closed door of the Fatima Masumeh shrine in reverence

Richard Brennan, director of emergency operations for the World Health Organization (WHO), who recently returned from Qom, said: ""Due to the special religious nature of Qom, with religious tourists coming from inside and outside Iran, the virus spread rapidly across the country.""

He said during his visit he had seen a ""genuine effort"" to increase operations in testing labs and hospitals in Qom and the capital Tehran.

The city's shrines have now been closed.

Did the government downplay the outbreak?

February saw two major events for the country - the 41st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution and the parliamentary elections.

""The first days that my colleagues and I recorded an abnormal respiratory disease were days before the Islamic Revolution victory day on 11 February,"" recalls one senior doctor, who says he sent multiple reports from his hospital to senior health ministers in Tehran warning of the outbreak.

""We believe that health officials decided to hide the fact that coronavirus had reached Iran to have their usual state-sponsored gatherings.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Iran marks the Islamic Revolution anniversary in Azadi (Freedom) square

Both the anniversary event and the elections were seen as a test of the government's popularity, after six months of chaos endured by Iranians.

These included violent protests in November following a fuel price hike, and rising tensions with the US, after Iran attacked a base in Iraq housing American troops in retaliation for the killing of the top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani.

Shortly after the election, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Iran's ""enemies"" of exaggerating the threat of coronavirus to keep voters away from the polls.

""Negative propaganda was launched several months ago, and in the last two days their media has used every opportunity to discourage people from casting their vote on the pretext of an illness and virus,"" said Mr Khamenei.

More recently, Iran's health minister Saeed Namaki, rejected all claims of delaying reports, with state TV announcing ""the issue was immediately announced [19 Feb] despite the fact the election was was due to be held that Friday [21 Feb]"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Iranians cast their ballot at a polling station in Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine,

Five days after the election, the number of cases confirmed by the government had risen to 139 with 19 dead.

The same day, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, a hardline MP from Qom, stood up in parliament and said 50 people had died in his city over a two-week period.

Deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi denied Mr Farahani's claim, and said he would resign if the death toll stood at even half that number.

Later that day, Harirchi was seen sweating profusely and coughing during a press conference on coronavirus. He later announced he had tested positive, becoming the first of many high-profile Iranian politicians to become infected.

Harirchi reportedly has since made a ""full recovery"" appearing live on television on 13 March.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi wipes his sweat during a press conference

Numerous experts and journalists have suggested the official figures are a dangerous and vast underestimate of the true scale of the crisis in Iran, including a BBC Persian investigation which established on a single day, the death toll to be six times higher than reported.

But as even the official figures continue to soar, the question now for Iranians is how to stop the virus.

Living in lockdown

Alireza's father passed away in mid-March.

""Nobody in our family was there when they buried my father. I didn't even get to see his body. They just told us he'd died and had been buried in a special zone in Tehran's main cemetery.""

For safety, Alireza's name has been changed.

Alireza's family were told by the authorities not to gather for a funeral but that they would be able to visit the grave once her father had been buried.

But upon arriving at the cemetery, she was told by staff it wasn't safe to enter because they were still burying so many other bodies.

""We talk more about the burial of my father than his death,"" she says. ""I'm not a religious, or even spiritual person, but I still have this strange feeling inside, as if we disrespected my father.""

The Iranian authorities have now banned all large funeral gatherings.

Several clerics, including the Supreme Leader, have also issued religious fatwas against the traditional washing of dead bodies, to protect those working as ""mordeshoors"" - or body-washers.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Firefighters disinfect the Tajrish Bazaar, Tehran, Iran

As the WHO calls for international ""urgent and aggressive action"", Iran's response continues to fall short of the measures implemented in countries such as China or Italy.

Schools, universities and seminaries have been closed, football matches cancelled, and a large-scale disinfection campaign has begun in the capital city, Tehran. All Iranians have been advised against travel and told to stay at home. And for the first time since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979, Friday prayers have been cancelled.

In an attempt to prevent the spread of the disease in overcrowded jails, 155,000 prisoners were also temporarily released. This includes political prisoners, many of whom are believed to be in poor health, among them British-Iranian charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.

However, most government buildings, offices and banks remain open.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A prevention campaign poster in the capital Tehran

Even for middle-class Iranians such as retired teachers Fatemeh and her husband - not their real names - say the problem is most people are still reliant on cash for buying everything from groceries to fuel.

'We have to go to the bank to collect our monthly pension. We are expecting to receive the Nowruz [Persian new year] special allowance in the coming days.''

Many medical experts inside and outside Iran say unless the government establishes transparent incident figures and moves to quarantine whole cities such as Qom, the virus will continue to cripple the entire country.

President Rouhani has repeatedly said the government will not place cities under lockdown and for ""all shops to remain open and everyone to continue doing business"", a decision many believe is simply because Iran cannot afford to do otherwise. The US sanctions have devastated the economy.

Persian new year is the country's biggest annual festival. Ayatollah Khamenei used the event to praise the country's ""dazzling"" sacrifices in responding to the outbreak.

For Fatemeh, it has never seemed less of a moment to celebrate.

""In all my life, I don't ever remember staying home alone for Nowruz. Even during the war, when Saddam started attacking cities with missiles, we would visit each other during Nowruz."""

A Facebook group, set up to help stranded Britons there, had more than 130 members on Tuesday, with many sharing the same stories of being turned away from flights because they transited through places such as Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, all of which do not accept passengers from Indonesia.

Around one in five people around the globe are under lockdown, ordered to stay home as the world enters a critical week in responding to the accelerating coronavirus pandemic.

As of Tuesday there have been at least 378,679 confirmed cases of people with the virus across the world. More than 16,500 people have died while almost 101,000 have recovered.

The first 100,000 cases took 67 days to appear, while the most recent 100,000 just four days, noted the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. But “we are not helpless bystanders”, he said.

An estimated 1.7 billion people have been ordered to remain at home as governments take extreme measures to protect their populations.

Britain has become the latest country to enter lockdown, after bans on movement came into force at midnight on Monday. The measures also include strict limits on gatherings and even exercise – all enforced by police. Non-essential shops, playgrounds, libraries and other venues were closed, said the prime minister, Boris Johnson, in a televised address to the nation.

Johnson warned people would only be allowed outside to buy food or medication, exercise alone once a day, or to travel to work if absolutely necessary. “You must stay at home,” he said.

Hours after the UK lockdown began, Chinese authorities announced travel restrictions in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, would be lifted on Wednesday, except for Wuhan city where they would be lifted on 8 April. Wuhan has been under lockdown since 23 January.

In the US, where about 40% of the population are under restrictions, laws were enacted making it a crime to stockpile medical supplies. There have been 557 deaths and nearly 44,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US, but President Donald Trump told a televised press conference he was not open to the idea of restrictive public health measures going on for months.

Trump said that he wanted the US economy to reopen within weeks, and refused to say if he would follow the advice of public health authorities if they said restrictions had to stay in place whether or not they damaged the economy.

“Our country was not built to be shut down,” Trump said. “This is not a country that was built for this.”

He also urged people not to blame or target Asian Americans over the virus. “It’s very important that we protect our Asian American community in the US and all around the world. They’re amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form.”

The day before, he had referred to the “Chinese virus” twice in a press conference.

New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, reported 5,707 new cases in the state on Monday, bringing the total to 20,875. New York City, which is home to 8.4 million people, is becoming one of the world’s biggest hotspots with more than 12,000 people testing positive. Almost 100 have died.

In Australia the fallout has continued after authorities on Thursday allowed a cruise ship with sick passengers to dock and all 2,700 passengers to disembark. More than 130 have since been diagnosed with Covid-19, including one who died on Tuesday.

New Zealand, which recorded 40 new cases, was readying for a total national lockdown on Wednesday and warned its citizens overseas that they should probably shelter in place where they are

In a sliver of good news, Italian authorities reported a second successive drop in daily deaths and infections from Covid-19. On Monday there were 601 deaths, compared with 651 on Sunday and 651 on Saturday. New cases on Monday were 4,789, down from 6,557 reported on Saturday.

“We cannot declare victory just yet,” said Giulio Gallera, chief medical officer for the northern region of Lombardy.

“But there is light at the end of the tunnel.”

British nationals stuck on the Indonesian holiday island of Bali are calling on the government to bring them home, saying they face the prospect of being trapped for months due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

Two travellers told the Guardian they had tried to follow Foreign Office advice to return home immediately due to the escalating seriousness of the Covid-19 outbreak, only to arrive at Bali’s Denpasar airport and be told they would not be able to board flights due to travel restrictions in countries through which they transit.

A Facebook group, set up to help stranded Britons there, had more than 130 members on Tuesday, with many sharing the same stories of being turned away from flights because they transited through places such as Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, all of which do not accept passengers from Indonesia.

Many called on the government to bring them home and were sharing contact details for MPs.

Among those sharing their stories in the group were key workers including NHS staff, teachers, a prison custody officer, firefighter, pharmacist, food distribution worker and army reservist.

Several said they had been told by airline Emirates that they might have to remain in Bali for three months. For one traveller, Pauline Bennett, 56, a support worker from Bishop’s Stortford, a delay could be fatal.

“He said you might have to stay for three months and I almost passed out at that point, because I thought, I’ll be dead,” she told the Guardian over the phone.

Bennett has a bone marrow disease and is required to take chemotherapy medication each day to prevent her having a stroke. Bennett said she had enough medication to last her until Saturday.

“I’m running so low on my chemo,” she said. “When you’ve got underlying health issues and your meds are running out, it’s a desperate situation.”

“It’s horrendous, I’m just so distraught,” she said.

Bennett travelled to Bali with her husband, Steven, in early March for the “trip of a lifetime” to visit their daughter, who lives in Australia. Due to her health condition, she checked with her GP and other doctors before travelling and said they gave her the all-clear.

How can the government just leave us here like this? Pauline Bennett, holidaymaker

When Bennett saw warnings about the need for British citizens to return home due to coronavirus, she and her husband booked a flight home, which was due to depart on Monday. When they arrived at the airport, Bennett said she was told the flight was cancelled because of travel restrictions in the UAE, where she was due to change planes.

Indonesia, which has been criticised for being slow to respond to the outbreak, had recorded 48 deaths and 514 infections on Monday night. However, the death toll has prompted speculation the number of cases is higher than official records suggest. Earlier this month, the country of 264 million people had carried out only a few hundred tests.

Bennett said she and other passengers had received no support from the British government, despite many of them emailing the foreign office seeking assistance. Bennett received an automated reply to her email requesting help. In the email, seen by the Guardian, she was advised to “please read our coronavirus guidance and country-specific travel advice” and to “register for updates”.

“They need to do something to get us back,” said Bennett. “How can the government just leave us here like this?” she said.

Maddie Kembrey, a 20-year-old student from Bristol, is also trapped in Bali, after a holiday with her parents.

Kembrey and her family arrived in Bali on 8 March and said they had been monitoring the status of their return flights throughout their holiday, and were advised something was wrong only when they arrived at the airport on Monday and were told they were cancelled.

“We’re all petrified really. Because if nothing gets done, they told us we have to stay here for three months,” she said. “We looked at the government website and they talk about how bad the hospitals are. Someone needs to get us home.”

“We need [the government] to send a flight over, really,” she said. “There’s literally nothing we can do.”

A spokesperson for the foreign and commonwealth office said: “We recognise that any British people currently overseas may be nervous about the impact of coronavirus on their travel and their health. We are in close contact with travel providers and our international partners to provide support to those British people affected by ongoing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”"

Donald Trump has said he was eager to reopen the US economy in weeks, not months, even as the death toll from the virus continued to rise.

The president, who has been anxious about the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the US economy, made the remarks at a White House press briefing Monday in which he repeatedly refused to confirm that he would listen to public health authorities if they advised him to keep restrictive public health measures in place, even at a cost to the economy.

“We’ll see what happens,” he said.

White House officials announced at the briefing that New York City, New Jersey and Long Island were emerging as a concerning hot spot for many new coronavirus cases.

The US reported more than 100 deaths on Monday, the first time the daily death toll has entered the triple digits. There have been 557 deaths and nearly 44,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US, according to figures from Johns Hopkins.

But in his remarks, Trump focused on states across the country that had seen few confirmed coronavirus cases so far, rural states like Nebraska, Iowa, and Idaho. The president argued that it was essential to the economy be “opening up our country” again as soon as possible.

“Our country was not built to be shut down,” Trump said. “This is not a country that was built for this.”

During the briefing, White House officials praised Americans for their “selflessness” in the first week of widespread restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus, and for making sacrifices like staying at home, or ordering takeout instead of going to a restaurant. Trump’s top advisers referred to current government restrictions as a “15 day challenge” and pledged to revisit the need for sweeping measures to prevent the spread of the virus in just another week.

The president said he expected life to return to normal very soon, much sooner than in three or four months. Asked if he meant the country would be re-opening in “weeks or months”, Trump said: “I’m not looking at months, I can tell you right now.”

Asked if Dr Anthony Fauci, the immunologist who has become the public face of the American scientific community during the pandemic, agreed with him on potentially re-opening the economy, Trump said: “He doesn’t not agree.”

Trump signals change in coronavirus strategy that could clash with health experts Read more

“He understands there’s a tremendous cost to our country,” the president added.

Fauci, who has spoken publicly about the challenges of focusing on facts about the pandemic even as Trump’s White House has sometimes undermined those facts, was not present at Monday’s White House briefing.

As the record-high stock market plummeted and then plummeted again, Trump has raised concerns that the “cure” for the coronavirus pandemic could be “worse than the problem itself.” During the press conference, Trump repeatedly argued that a damaged American economy could create “more death” than potential deaths from the coronavirus, because of an association between economic crisis and suicide.

“People get tremendous anxiety and depression and you have suicide over things like this, when you have a terrible economy, you have death, definitely … in far greater numbers than we’re talking about with regard to the virus,” Trump said.

While it is reasonable to suggest that a recession can increase the risk of a rise in suicides, experts caution that there is no single cause of suicide.

According to research published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, North America and Europe experienced 10,000 more suicides during the 2008 recession. The outbreak of Sars in Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003 also led to a “significant increase” in suicides in those over age 65, according to 2010 research.

But early projections for the toll of coronavirus in the United States suggest it could lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths, even at the lowest end of ranges of estimates. While the figures for the mortality rate of coronavirus continues to evolve, recent research from Wuhan, China, the city where the outbreak began, indicates the mortality rate there was around 1.4%. Experts at Harvard University have projected an infection rate in the US of between 20% and 60%, meaning that while it is impossible to reliably estimate the American coronavirus death toll, a reasonable scenario might result in hundreds of thousands of lives lost.

At the press briefing, Trump said that he found the emerging data on mortality rates of coronavirus encouraging. Asked if he was concerned that if he eased government restrictions to prevent coronavirus “too early”, the virus might continue to spread unabated, he said that the mortality rate for coronavirus was not as bad as had been initially feared.

At the beginning, “nobody knew anything about this particular virus”, and Trump said he heard numbers that the mortality rate for the virus might be as high as 5%, compared with “.001 or 2 or 3” percent for the normal flu.

Now, Trump said, he was hearing potential mortality rate numbers that were lower.

“The whole concept of death is terrible, but there’s a tremendous difference between something under 1% and 4 or 5 or even 3%,” the president said.

On one issue, Trump expressed some interest in the possibility that coronavirus might reshape American life forever.

As he looked out at the much-more-empty than usual White House briefing room, with journalists carefully spaced out to follow public health guidelines, Trump noted that the briefing room had once been full of lots of “angry people who don’t like me”.

“Will we ever have that again, or ... it will look like this forever?” Trump asked his coronavirus response coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx.

Attorney general Bill Barr, who was standing behind Trump, chuckled.

“I don’t know,” Birx said.

In brief: an Italian-style lockdown to force people to stay at home beyond a small range of very limited circumstances. Under the terms explained by Boris Johnson in his TV address, people will be allowed to leave home only for the following reasons:

shopping for necessities, as infrequently as possible;

one form of exercise a day, such as running or cycling, alone or with household members;

for medical or care needs, for example to help a vulnerable person;

travelling to and from work, but only if you cannot work from home.

Meeting friends, shopping for anything beyond essentials, and gathering in crowds are now banned.

What enforcement action will there be?

Police will be able to enforce the rules, and impose fines on people who do not abide by them. Authorities will force the closure of all shops selling non-essential goods, including hair and nail salons, and all markets apart from food markets. Also closed will be libraries, outdoor gyms and playgrounds, and churches or other places of worship. Hotels, B&Bs, campsites and caravan parks will also be closed, apart from to permanent residents or key workers. All public gatherings of more than two people will be banned, except if those people share a household. Also prohibited are all social events such as weddings and baptisms, although funerals will be permitted to take place.

How long will it last?

At least three weeks. Johnson said that after that point, the government will relax the rules “if the evidence shows we are able to” – but this is by no means certain.

What is this meant to do?

The hope is to severely limit the scale of physical and social interaction, and thus slow the spread of the coronavirus so that the growth in cases does not overwhelm the NHS and lead to mass deaths. As Johnson put it: “Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope.”

Will it work?

This remains to be seen – and given the time lag between infections and people becoming critically ill, it will be up to two weeks before any benefits are realised. On Monday, Italy recorded a slight reduction in the number of coronavirus deaths, two weeks after it introduced a national lockdown. So the UK can expect an exponential growth in infections and deaths first, before – hopefully – the curve flattens.

What has been the situation up till now?

There has been a gradual increase in restrictions, going from ministers urging people to work from home if possible and avoid pubs and other crowded places, to schools and nurseries being closed, and then on Friday the forced closure of pubs, clubs, restaurants, gyms and other communal businesses. However, the information on physical distancing has thus far been framed as advice, with Johnson stressing the desire of people to be out of doors.

What was the background to the move?

Opposition parties and, increasingly, some Conservative MPs have been pushing for tougher restrictions on people’s movement, especially following much-shared photos over the weekend of crowds in national parks and elsewhere. Speaking in the Commons on Monday, the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said: “We must move to lockdown rules now that ban non-essential travel. It’s time not just to ask people to do social distancing, but enforce social distancing rules.”

What’s happened in other countries?

Many other European countries have taken a lockdown approach, generally a week or so before the UK. Italy saw a ban on almost all movement in the north of the country which was extended, and then intensified, with only a selection of vital shops and businesses allowed to open, and police checking on people’s movements. Spain and France have taken similar measures.

The most extreme approach was taken in China, where authorities essentially sealed off 11 million people in Wuhan, where the virus first began spreading, before extending the quarantine zone to take in more than 50 million people. People were kept in apartment blocks, with visitors and almost all outside movements banned. Other measures included compulsory temperature tests, and the placing of those feared to be ill in isolation."

UK wakes up to lockdown

Police in Britain will enforce new coronavirus restrictions, which only allow people outside to buy food or medicines, exercise alone once a day, or to travel to work if absolutely necessary. “You must stay at home,” Boris Johnson said, with the news that all non-essential shops, playgrounds and libraries were now closed.

Donald Trump vows to reopen US economy, despite coronavirus

President Trump said he will not shut the economy down for months to stop the coronavirus, suggesting such a shutdown could be “worse than the problem itself”. Asked if Anthony Fauci, the immunologist who has become the public face of the American scientific community during the pandemic, agreed with him on re-opening the economy, Trump said Fauci “understands there’s a tremendous cost to our country”. A senior Republican offical from Texas said older people would rather die than sacrifice the economy.

Around 20% of global population under lockdown

Around one in five people around the globe have been ordered to stay home. The first 100,000 cases took 67 days to appear, while the most recent 100,000 just four days, noted the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. But “we are not helpless bystanders”, he said.

China to lift travel restrictions in Hubei province

All travel restrictions in and out of Hubei province, the centre of the pandemic, will be lifted on Wednesday, except for in the city Wuhan, which will have to wait until 8 April. Movement will be conditional on people having a health code clearance. Wuhan has been under lockdown since 23 January. Nationally, China reported 78 new cases on Tuesday, all but four of which were “imported”.

Taiwan reports 20 new cases

Taipei has announced 20 new cases of Covid-19, bringing the total to 215.

All new cases were imported, with the patients having travelled to countries including Britain, Ireland, Turkey and Indonesia, the government said in a statement.

Australian states close borders

Queensland joined four other Australian states in announcing it would close its borders, as the national death toll rose to eight. The woman in her 70s had been a passenger on the Ruby Princess, which docked in Sydney on Thursday. Its 2,700 passengers left the ship without tests and more than 130 are now known to be infected.

Markets rise on Fed’s promise of dollar funding

Asian stocks rebounded sharply on Tuesday as the US federal reserve’s promise of bottomless dollar funding eased painful strains in financial markets, even if it could not soften the immediate economic hit of the coronavirus. Japan’s Nikkei rose 7%, Shanghai was up 1.75%, Korea’s Kospi rose 7%, and Australia’s ASX200 finished more than 4% up.

Myanmar reports first cases

Two men who had recently travelled to the US and the UK were Myanmar’s first Covid-19 cases.

Global ceasefire plea

Antonio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, appealed for an immediate global ceasefire, calling for an end to all armed conflicts so that the world could instead focus on fighting Covid-19.

Olympics speculation

The Japanese Olympics minister, Seiko Hashimoto, told reporters the world needed to put an end to the coronavirus before the Olympics could be held in their “complete form”. There is no official confirmation that the Games will be postponed, but Canada and Australia have said they will not send athletes."

Johnson’s comments on 1 March during a visit to Public Health England’s command centre was made when just 35 infections had been confirmed in the UK.

Just over three weeks later, in a televised national address, the prime minister has ordered that people can leave their homes only for the most limited purposes, including shopping for essentials, medical needs, to provide care for a vulnerable person, for work or strictly limited exercise. And he said that gathering in groups of more than two was prohibited.

The newly announced restrictions follow days of controversy over whether the UK was moving too slowly to force Britons to stay at home except in exceptional circumstances as the death toll reached 335.

Four other large countries with significant outbreaks of the virus have moved at a variety of paces and taken different steps to enact their own lockdowns, most – but not all – acting before reaching the UK’s death toll:

China

Lockdown in Hubei province begins 23 January with death toll at 17

China, where the first cases of coronavirus emerged, was the first country to announce a major lockdown, in Wuhan and the other big cities in Hubei province. At the time of the announcement, the disease was confirmed to have claimed 17 lives and infected almost 600 other people, although it is not clear how accurate a picture this represents after the first cases emerged in mid-December.

In the early hours of 23 January, residents were told that from 10am that day all public transport would be closed and residents of Wuhan were forbidden to leave the city, although large numbers are believed to have fled before the lockdown. By late afternoon, roads from Wuhan and other exits had been shut off.

Italy

Lockdown begins 9 March with death toll at 463 and 9,000 infections

Italy imposed its lockdown after attempting a limited quarantine of northern towns and then a chaotic quarantine of the north only that led to thousands attempting to flee.

The lockdown restricted movement of the population except for necessity, work and health circumstances. Additional restrictions mandated the temporary closure of non-essential shops and businesses. Two days later, the lockdown was tightened to close all commercial and retail businesses except those providing essential services, such as grocery stores and pharmacies.

Spain

Lockdown begins 15 March with death toll at 288 and 7,753 cases

After a marathon cabinet session the day before, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told Spaniards they were banned from leaving home except for work and for essential travel. Cases had exploded at the start of the month, with 30 deaths by 9 March.

A state of emergency also ordered the closure of all non-essential shops as well as bars, restaurants, cafes, football grounds and cinemas. People are allowed out only to work, to buy food and medicine, to travel to health centres or banks, and to look after the elderly or dependants.

France

Lockdown announced on evening of 16 March with death toll at 148 and with 6,633 confirmed cases

France had reached China’s 17 deaths around 8 March and moved to a full lockdown just over a week later. Similar to the Italian lockdown, French citizens were tightly restricted, with people expected to stay at home, leaving only for essential activities such as food shopping on pain of a fixed fine of €135. Officials later clarified that a dispensation for exercise meant walks or runs of no more than “1km, 2km max” and close to home."

On a historic day for Britain, all of the national newspapers have given over their front pages to news of the unprecedented coronavirus lockdown.

The Guardian says today that Boris Johnson will order police to enforce a strict coronavirus lockdown, with gatherings of more than two people banned. The headline: “PM: Stay at home, this is a national emergency”.

The Daily Mail gives the first 22 pages of the paper to Johnson’s Monday evening announcement. Describing it as an unprecedented move, it reported all non-essential shops would close during a lockdown that is expected to last at least three weeks, and that police would have powers to fine those breaking the new rules. “Lockdown Britain” is the headline.

The Daily Mirror reports the prime minister as saying only drastic action can help the NHS cope with the coronavirus outbreak. “National lockdown,” is the headline.

The Times goes with: “You must stay at home” and says fines for breaking the new rules will range from £30 to £1,000 once legislation passes on Thursday. It carries a sketch from Quentin Letts who notes that the “absence of melodrama” in Johnson’s televised address made it all the more striking and urgent.

It also gives prominence to a letter from the editor, Roula Khalaf, in which she explains the challenges of putting the paper together with many journalists at home, and why some FT articles are no longer behind a paywall.

The prime minister ratcheted up Britain’s response with an address to the nation on Monday evening, warning that people would only be allowed outside to buy food or medication, exercise alone once a day, or to travel to work if absolutely necessary.

All non-essential shops will close with immediate effect, as will playgrounds and libraries, he said in the address from Downing Street.

Quick guide UK lockdown: what are the new coronavirus restrictions? Show Hide What do the new restrictions involve? People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes: Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible

One form of exercise a day – for example a run, walk, or cycle – alone or with members of your household

Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person

Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will: Close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship

Stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with

Stop all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.

After days of being accused of sending mixed messages about what the public should do, Johnson significantly escalated his language as he urged people to comply with the more stringent measures.

“You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine – and you should do this as little as you can,” he said.

“If you don’t follow the rules, the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.”

The decision follows Friday’s announcement that all pubs, restaurants and gyms should shut down, then the continuation of commuters packing into trains on Monday, and of sun-seekers crowding into parks over the weekend.

After weeks of being reluctant to copy the draconian measures seen elsewhere in Europe, Johnson announced the plan after coming under pressure from his own cabinet and Tory backbenchers as well as Labour.

“In this fight, we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted. Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together. To halt the spread of this disease. To protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives,” he said.

“And I know that as they have in the past so many times, the people of this country will rise to that challenge. And we will come through it stronger than ever.”

It is understood that Johnson himself had until now been holding out against a lockdown, with senior advisers such as Dominic Cummings having pushed for tougher measures in the last week after initially backing a more relaxed approach.

In the past few days, there had been concern about announcing a lockdown before police had the proper powers to enforce one – it will only come into law when the emergency coronavirus legislation is passed later in the week.

However, Johnson has been pressured into action by the scale of worry in his own party and signs that the UK’s deaths from coronavirus are following the same pattern as Italy with a two-week lag. The total confirmed death toll rose to 335 on Monday – a sixfold increase on this time last week.

“Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,” Johnson said.

“And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease.”

Over the weekend, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, had appeared to take a much clearer stance on physical distancing than the prime minister, telling the capital’s residents to stay at home. “This isn’t advice, as far as I’m concerned. These are instructions and these are rules that we should all obey to stop people dying,” he said.

The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, welcomed the measures. “Something did have to change. We’re seeing more and more people lose their lives to this virus and the social distancing measures that the government had announced have simply not been working,” he said.

“You see beaches full of people, parks full of people, bustling markets. So we were encouraging the PM to go further this morning: we called on him to take emergency action to enforce social distancing, and it looks like that’s what he’s done this evening. So we do support it, and the drastic measures he’s taken tonight.”

Some in policing are dubious whether they currently have the powers to enforce a lockdown. One source said police were being told they would be given the powers within days, possibly being included in the emergency laws being passed through parliament now.

It is seen as anathema to the British style of policing by consent, and officers being citizens in uniform: “There is absolute reluctance,” said another source. “It’s a total change of policing style.”

The chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, Martin Hewitt, said: “We are working with the government and other agencies to consider how these new rules can be most effectively enforced.”

The NPCC quickly squashed suggestions that police would be assisted by troops on the streets or road blocks deployed to enforce the lockdown. A spokesperson told the Guardian: “Neither are being considered in any way.”

The national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, John Apter, said: “The practicalities of policing this lockdown will be challenging … policing will do all it can to keep the public safe, but we need the public to support us. I ask that the public heed the advice and stay at home unless absolutely necessary.

“This will allow police officers to concentrate on keeping the streets safe and deal with all the regular calls we receive. This is about saving lives and supporting our NHS. I ask that the public gives us their support in this time of crisis.”

Many Tory MPs are worried that No 10 has not moved fast enough to enforce stricter distancing measures, amid public alarm about evidence of people ignoring advice.

Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, had a stark message for No 10 that a lockdown rule was needed immediately if the UK was to have any chance of avoiding a situation like that in Italy, where the health service is overwhelmed and many hundreds are dying every day.

“It may be too late to avoid Italy. But to have any chance, we need to move to lockdown rules now that ban non-essential travel. It’s time to stop asking people to do social distancing – we must enforce it. Not this week, not tomorrow, but today,” Hunt said.

As the prime minister’s statement was broadcast, MPs were debating emergency legislation giving the government the powers to ban gatherings, forcibly quarantine suspected sufferers, and compel schools to remain open, for a period of two years.

Ministers announced on Monday that the legislation could be reviewed by MPs every six months – a significant concession aimed at preventing a potential rebellion.

Labour had broadly supported the legislation, but sought more regular scrutiny of its sweeping powers. MPs debating measures sat widely dispersed on the green benches of the House of Commons, with many choosing to stay away.

After the compromise amendment was announced, Labour agreed to allow the legislation to pass without being forced to a vote."

Most have not been named, and the majority are older people with underlying health conditions – though in some cases family members and medical professionals have been keen to emphasise that they were expected to live with their conditions for many years.

Of the deaths so far, in the UK and those connected to the UK, details have emerged in at least 11 cases:

Peter Myles, 77

Myles’s struggles with Covid-19 were documented on social media by his daughter, the actor Sophia Myles. She said she had done it to show the “harsh reality of the coronavirus”. In 2018 she tweeted about her father’s diagnosis with Parkinson’s disease. Before he retired in 2008, Myles was an Anglican vicar at St John’s church in Isleworth, west London, where he was described as a “liberal soul”. After being ordained in 1971, his first job as curate was in Tideswell in Derbyshire. He spent the rest of his career in west London, including stints as a priest at St Peter’s church in Notting Hill and as chaplain to the bishop of Kensington. In his final years he lived in a care home close to St John’s. He died on 21 March.

Wendy Jacobs

Jacobs was the headteacher of Roose primary school in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. Her leadership of the school was repeatedly praised by inspectors. “This vibrant school provides a good quality of education with outstanding features,” they said in a recent report. The school’s chair of governors, Fred Chatfield, said her death was devastating for the school and the community. “This is a huge loss,” he said. Jacobs died on 22 March.

William Stern, 85

Born Vilmos György Stern in Budapest, Hungary, on 2 July 1935, Stern was imprisoned as a child in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp during the second world war. He shared his memories of Torah readings in the camp on the Shoah website. After the war he settled in London and went on to build a successful property empire. Stern Holdings collapsed in 1973 and in 1978 Stern was declared Britain’s biggest bankrupt with debts of £118m. He held the record for 14 years. He was a member of the ultra-Orthodox Charedi community in London.

Rina Feldman, 97

Like Stern, Feldman was a member of the ultra-orthodox Charedi community. No other details about her have been reported.

‘Aunty Jean’

Jean was the aunt of the former England rugby player Will Greenwood. In an Instagram post he said Aunty Jean “never did anything but bring sunshine into my life”. Greenwood said his aunt lived near his boarding school in Sedbergh, Cumbria. He said she was the eldest of three sisters and was in her 80s “but had so much living to do”. She died on 21 March.

Hassan Milani

Councillor Ali Milani, who was Labour’s parliamentary contender against Boris Johnson in Uxbridge and South Ruislip in the 2019 general election, revealed that his father, Hassan, had died after contracting the coronavirus on a trip to Iran. “In the early hours of this morning,” he said on Saturday, “my father tragically passed away after having contracted Covid-19. Please keep him in your prayers. This virus is taking millions all across the world.”

Craig Ruston, 45

Ruston, a rugby fan and father of two from Kettering, Northamptonshire, had been a footwear designer, including at Dr Martens, before being diagnosed with motor neurone disease. He had been writing about his struggle with the condition before he tested positive for Covid-19. But his posts became less frequent as he began losing the strength in his upper body. In one of his last, he wrote about a dream he had of standing beside his wife and daughters at his own funeral. He wrote: “I don’t fear death, but I can tear myself to pieces if I dwell too long on what happens when I’m gone.” His family said he was “not ready to go”. He died on 16 March.

Leonard Gibson, 78

Described by his family as a “typical jolly Irishman”, Gibson died on St Patrick’s Day, 17 March. He was born in County Tyrone and had 12 siblings. After moving to South Yorkshire aged 26, he worked at the coking plant at Orgreave. In retirement he enjoyed gardening, but problems with his lungs forced him to move into a sheltered housing flat in Oughtibridge, near Sheffield. He died in Sheffield Northern general hospital after being diagnosed with Covid-19. His daughters, Lisa, an NHS worker, and Michelle, a teaching assistant, were not allowed to visit him in hospital. Lisa said: “It is sad that we weren’t able to be with Daddy, but the nurses were there for us.”

Nick Matthews, 59

Described as a “true legend” of the Avon and Somerset police, Matthews retired as an officer in 2010 after a heart attack. He and his wife, Mary, from Nailsea in Somerset, had a week’s holiday on the Canary island of Fuerteventura at the end of February. Matthews was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary after complaining of breathing difficulties on 12 March. He died on 14 March after testing positive for Covid-19.

Darrell Blakeley, 88

Blakeley was a churchgoer from Middleton in Rochdale and sang in the choir. He had a “beautiful voice”, according to a spokeswoman for St Michael’s church. He was also regarded as a “gracious gentleman”, she said. He had underlying health conditions and fell ill after coming into contact with someone who had travelled to Italy. Blakeley was admitted to North Manchester general hospital on 3 March suffering from sepsis. He tested positive for Covid-19 on 10 March and died three days later.

Kimberley Finlayson, 53

Finlayson was the first British victim of coronavirus to be named after she died on holiday on the island of Bali in Indonesia on 11 March. She was the founder of a dental communication business based in Shenley, Hertfordshire, one of the counties worst hit at the start of the outbreak in the UK. She had four children. Her colleagues paid tribute to her “passion, creativity and determination”. Finlayson suffered from lung disease and diabetes before she was diagnosed with Covid-19."
https://www.theguardian.com/international,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/24/testing-times-for-students-food-banks-open-at-universities,2020-03-24T07:00:26,Testing times for students: food banks open at universities,"Gemma Peacock has little money left over after she has paid her rent. She worked all summer to save up funds to supplement her university maintenance loan, but near the end of term she has a battle to make ends meet.

“It can be stressful,” says Peacock, a 20-year-old psychology student at Leeds Beckett University. “If I’m struggling I will walk every day instead of paying for the bus, and some days I have to walk for over two hours just to get to and from uni. I can afford basic food with my loan, but a lot of the time, I’m not eating a balanced diet.”

That’s why Peacock turned to the food bank that Leeds Beckett students’ union (LBSU) has set up to help struggling students. It has allowed her to stock up on basics like pasta and beans, freeing up more cash for fresh food.

Tucked away discreetly next door to the student bar, the food bank is a small shop space adorned with fairy lights and shelves stacked with pasta, rice, tins of soup, chocolate biscuits and tampons. To the side are crates of fresh vegetables.

Dotted around the shop are signs reading, poignantly, “Give or take”. The initiative is about encouraging students to donate, as much as it is about helping those in need, say the volunteers.

With the coronavirus outbreak making students even more financially vulnerable, the service has become more important than ever, and the student union has increased the opening hours and organised to drop food packages at students’ homes to ensure all are provided for, even if they’re self-isolating.

One of the main challenges is giving people the confidence to use it. “A lot of people are quite embarrassed to say they need help,” says Fozia Iqbal, one of the students who helps to run the service.

Some do come in regularly, while for others it is a stop-gap. “One girl who came in told me that she needed something because she was getting paid tomorrow, and she needed to eat tonight. I thought, ‘Without this she probably would have gone hungry’.”

Iqbal herself has only about £100 left each term after paying rent. Last year she juggled three part-time jobs while studying for her master’s in architecture, relying on the student union’s pay-as-you-feel soup kitchen on the run-up to payday.

Jake Butler, a student finance expert from Save the Student, a student money advice site, says its latest accommodation survey shows the average maintenance loan now doesn’t cover the average student rent.

According to the survey, published in February, the average student rent is now £126 a week (£6,552 a year), and £162 in London (£8,400 a year). The survey polled 2,168 students in December 2019 and January 2020.

Students receive on average £540 a month in their maintenance loans, according to Save the Student’s calculations. With the average student rent working out at £547.82 a month, many students have little or no money left for food and other essentials.

Unsurprisingly, 62% of students think the maintenance loan is not enough.

Jess Carrier, the welfare and community officer at LBSU, says the system doesn’t work for many students: “Even though it is supposedly means-tested, not everyone is supported by their family.”

Peacock says: “My mum works seven days a week, so it’s not really fair of me to ask her because she’s struggling herself anyway. I don’t want to take her money off her.”

The fact that students are turning to food banks at university is worrying, says Butler. “Unless the government does something about the maintenance loan, we could see university food banks opening up in more locations. The system is long overdue for reform.”

Leeds Beckett isn’t the only university to start a food bank. Last year the University of Kent launched Stuff – a student food bank and freecycle scheme offering food and recycled homeware. Kent is planning to keep the service running throughout the coronavirus crisis.

At Northumbria University, the students’ union has had to close its food bank service supplying food parcels, but has redirected all provisions to help self-isolating students.

Staffordshire University student union has been running its Food Hub since 2014. In the last academic year the service was accessed 183 times, and numbers are set to increase in 2019-20, with more than 100 students having used the Food Hub so far. Like LBSU, they’re stocking up on provisions from wholesalers at the moment to ensure they have enough to keep students going.

The students’ union recognises that even while avoiding the term “food bank” students still face stigma, and has started using food vouchers that allow students to get food at retail outlets on site.

Connor Bayliss, president of Staffordshire University students’ union, says: “Sixty-five per cent of our students are local, many are mature or commute, and a high percentage of them are juggling caring or parental responsibilities and part-time work with their studies. Some students, such as those with children, are entitled to universal credit, and some have been “significantly affected” by the problems of its introduction, he says.

Stoke-on-Trent, where it is based, is ranked as the 14th most deprived local authority area in England. “In some cases, support can mean providing enough food for their families.”

Eve Crossan Jory, vice-president for welfare of the National Union of Students, says she is “appalled but unsurprised” at the increase in food banks. “Student maintenance funding is woefully inadequate, while rents are spiralling out of control. In one of the wealthiest societies, the fact that students and non-students alike need to access food banks is shameful.”"

Tens of millions of Chinese residents living near the centre of the coronavirus outbreak will be able to resume travel from Wednesday, after authorities announced restrictions would be lifted in Hubei province, except in the city of Wuhan.

The move comes as China claims to have largely brought their outbreak under control, reporting only imported cases of the virus and few or no new domestic cases in recent days. However the claims have been questioned by residents and analysts, who note reported refusals to test for the virus by some hospitals, and allegations of manipulated numbers, and rumours of unreported cases. .

On Tuesday the Hubei provincial government said it would lift the control order on residents of the region, not including the city of Wuhan, after midnight, and “outbound traffic will be restored in an orderly manner”. The change will allow people to travel to other places within and outside Hubei province.

Life after lockdown: has China really beaten coronavirus? Read more

The control orders on outbound traffic in Wuhan, home to 11m people and the wet market where the virus is believed to have originated, will lift on 8 April.

All residents will still need the “Green Code” in order to travel. The code is a health classification designated by a controversial monitoring system using the AliPay app.

The lifting of travel orders follows an easing of lockdown restrictions in the region in recent days. On Monday, small groups of Wuhan residents were allowed to leave their residential compounds, going to shops and walking along the streets, for the first time in weeks. On the weekend, more than 1,000 workers from elsewhere in the province arrived on a train back to the city for work.

Wuhan and some neighbouring cities were put under strict lockdown on 23 January, weeks after the emergence of Covid-19, information about which was suppressed by the Chinese government and officials.

It was the largest lockdown in human history, and drew scepticism and praise from health bodies. Now, as other countries across the world deal with their own massive outbreaks, many governments have announced lockdowns of their own. On Tuesday, around one fifth of the world’s population was under some kind of order to stay inside their home.

Few appear as aggressive as China’s, which saw officials go door-to-door for health checks, forcing sick people into isolation, including the family of a disabled boy who was reportedly left alone and died.

The shortages have been devastating. Seamstresses have been asked to make masks for hospital workers. As one hospital’s equipment supply diminished, one anesthesiologist wore a plastic bag over his head during a procedure. Construction companies have been asked to donate existing supplies of respirator masks.

Doctors and nurses even started a crowdsourcing website to accept and distribute donations – GetUsPPE.org. Medical students in New York City are soliciting donations through PPE2NYC.org.

“There are dwindling supplies of N95 respirators, isolation gowns, isolation masks, surgical masks, eye protection equipment, intensive care unit (ICU) equipment and diagnostic testing supplies in areas that had the first community outbreaks,” a lobbying groups for nurses, doctors and hospitals said in a letter to congressional leadership on Thursday.

This is an anesthesiologist, Dr. John Henao, who is running out of PPE (personal protective equipment) at his hospital.

Neighbors of nurses and doctors are leaving masks on doorsteps as a donation. Healthcare workers are isolating from family members within their own homes. Some workers are considering renting separate apartments.

The desperate need for appropriate protective gear has led some to remind people of another limited and vital resource: healthcare workers themselves.

“We’re bracing for the potential of having up to 30-40% of healthcare workforce step out of care at a given point of time,” said Dr Kelly Cawcutt, a critical care doctor and association director of infection control at one of the nation’s foremost infectious disease hospitals, the University of Nebraska Medical Center.

“Do I think we’re going to see a surge of patients? Yes. Are we concerned we could surge past capacity we have if we don’t do social distancing? Yes. And how long could it last? I think we’re all bracing for weeks and months of this,” said Cawcutt. “It all depends on how quickly the infection spreads and how well the mitigation strategies work.”

Donald Trump said he would invoke the Defense Production Act to corral private business into making “millions” of masks, but it remains uncertain whether the administration has gone beyond a simple proclamation. So far, formal agreements with private business to make more personal protective equipment have not materialized, and whether those efforts are ongoing is unclear.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already published crisis guidelines, which include workers potentially wearing homemade masks. In New York City, healthcare workers have been instructed to keep working, even if they have had high-risk exposure to coronavirus patients.

“The scary part is that we’re seeing hospitals say they don’t have enough PPE,” said Cawcutt. “Right now, do we have PPE? Yes. Do we have enough to get through the entire span of time? I don’t know yet.”"

The car is parked on the street outside, with a box of water in the boot. Do you risk it?

Such have been the sort of dilemmas facing people in Jordan since Saturday morning, when the Middle Eastern kingdom introduced one of the most stringent anti-coronavirus regimes in the world.

It was announced at 7am by rounds of air-raid sirens: every person in the country indefinitely confined to their homes. No grocery shopping. No trips to pharmacies. Not even a walk around the block. Those with medical emergencies could call the authorities, but anyone caught outside would be arrested. More than 800 people have been picked up so far, the military says.

Videos circulating on social media show army Humvees patrolling Amman’s beige streets. Another clip showed a veiled woman who parked her car in the middle of an empty street and danced to the music blaring from her stereo. Local media reported later reported her arrest.

Jordan has undergone the same whiplash-inducing shift to a new era as other countries. Nine days ago, cafes were full, tourist sites were open and just person had tested for the virus, and recovered.

In a cascade over the next days, flights were cancelled, Jordan’s airport closed, the borders of Amman sealed, non-essential businesses shut and, finally, everyone ordered to stay home.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A man looks out of his balcony in Amman. Jordan has 112 coronavirus cases so far. Photograph: Amel Pain/EPA

The curfew, imposed because people were flouting the government’s plaintive requests to stay home of their own volition, was announced at 3pm on the day before it came into force, triggering an immediate run on bakeries and supermarkets. In the hours before people would be isolated from each other for their protection, they were pressed shoulder-to-shoulder buying bread and milk.

On Monday, a government spokesman told Jordanians the curfew would extend for weeks, and they should make do with the basics until then. An unprecedented scheme for delivering bread, water and pharmaceuticals to the population of 10 million is being trialled from Tuesday, though how it will work is still unclear. Ministers have already warned citizens to get used to the absence of luxuries.

What is coronavirus – and what is the mortality rate? Read more

Possible problems abound. Will there be enough workers or cars to deliver on what is sure to be enormous demand? Will farmers and distributors be allowed out to keep the food system running? And what happens when people run out of cash?

For my circle, the toll of the curfew so far has been an accumulation of small inconveniences. The elaborate meals we planned to cook during isolation have been pared back. Supplies of hay fever medicine in our house have dwindled to a single pill. A friend with two dogs can’t walk either of them but says they are entertaining each other, for now.

But Jordan has shouldered far more than its fair share of refugees from across the region. On farms, in the poorer quarters of cities and in sprawling camps, more than 650,000 Syrians are also confined to their homes. There are few more resilient communities in the world, but most cannot afford to stockpile food for weeks.

“Those who can look after themselves are looking after themselves,” Ahmed, a Syrian who fled to Jordan from the city of Hama, said last week. “Those who don’t have food, don’t.”

The gamble is that a few weeks of difficulty might spare Jordan the horror that Italy, Iran and others are experiencing. Jordan has 112 coronavirus cases so far, with all but one said to be in good condition. The country’s health system is ranked by the World Health Organization as one of the least prepared in the region to fight a pandemic. The government had to act fast, and drastically.

If those who are confirmed to be sick are properly treated; if asymptomatic cases are confined long enough for the virus to work its way through them, their households and environments; if authorities can keep people satisfied long enough so that they adhere to the rules; and if the borders remain closed, preventing new cases from entering – Jordan could avoid the worst.

Four big “ifs”. On Monday night, the third day of the curfew, Jordanians gathered on their balconies to sing and cheer in solidarity with each other and health workers. It is to be a nightly ritual. Over the next weeks, it will convey the public mood."

Older people would rather die than let Covid-19 harm US economy – Texas official

As Donald Trump pushed to re-open the US economy in weeks, rather than months, the lieutenant governor of Texas went on Fox News to argue that he would rather die than see public health measures damage the US economy, and that he believed “lots of grandparents” across the country would agree with him.

“My message: let’s get back to work, let’s get back to living, let’s be smart about it, and those of us who are 70-plus, we’ll take care of ourselves,” Lt Gov Dan Patrick, a 69-year-old Republican, told Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Monday night.

“Don’t sacrifice the country,” Patrick said. “Don’t do that.”

Patrick said he feared that public health restrictions to prevent coronavirus could end American life as he knows it, and that he is willing to risk death to protect the economy for his grandchildren.

“You know, Tucker, no one reached out to me and said, ‘As a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren?’” Patrick said. “And if that’s the exchange, I’m all in.”

“That doesn’t make me noble or brave or anything like that,” he added. “I just think there are lots of grandparents out there in this country like me.”

At the White House’s coronavirus briefing Monday night, the administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, said that emerging data from Europe suggested that 99% of the coronavirus deaths were people over age 50, and that many had pre-existing conditions. That “doesn’t change the need to protect the elderly”, Birx said.

Trump, who has raised concerns about the damage that coronavirus prevention measures are doing to the US economy, said he was eager to return for the country to return to normal as soon as possible, and suggested that an economic crisis might result in more deaths, through suicide, than a global pandemic.

He did not answer questions from journalists about whether he would abide by the advice of public health experts if they told him next week that the government needed to keep restrictive measures in place over the longer term to prevent the spread of the virus.

Patrick, a Texas Republican, praised the president’s focus on the economy on Monday and said that it had “lifted” his heart.

“I don’t want the whole country to be sacrificed,” Patrick said. “I’ve talked to hundreds of people … and everyone says pretty much the same thing: We can’t lose our whole country. We’re having an economic collapse.”

“We’re going to be in a total collapse, recession, depression, collapse in our society if this goes on for another several months,” Patrick said. “As the president said, the mortality rate is so low. Do we have to shut down the entire country for this? I think we can get back to work.”

Patrick said that, as someone who turns 70 next week, he was in the high-risk group, but that he was willing to give up his life for his six grandchildren.

Overstretched and underfunded, hospitals were overwhelmed by winter flu and a backlog of people needing community care were waiting for pitifully limited provisions. Now the country faces a new crisis, these cracks have widened even further and people like me are already beginning to fall through them.

I am one of the 1.5 million people who were asked on Sunday by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to self-isolate for 12 weeks. Already more than aware of my “vulnerable” status, I have been observing self-isolation diligently. I realise coronavirus could leave me seriously ill, increasing the burden on a stretched NHS, so I am obeying those restrictions. But the amount I can do is limited when I’m wholly reliant on support from health and social care systems to remain out of hospital. I have 24-hour care, seven days a week, and am dependent on care workers for everything from repositioning me in bed and managing my stoma, my feeding pump and my non-invasive ventilation machine, to all other aspects of my personal care.

I arrange and manage my own care through the government system of “direct payments” – a scheme that devolves to me all choices over employment responsibilities and care management. I choose and hire my own care workers and am independent and self-managing. To date, this has been incredibly liberating, but so far, in pandemic times, I have been left feeling stranded, with no access to a trained bank of cover staff, or even personal protective equipment – such as gloves, masks and hand sanitiser. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, yesterday announced that “hubs” would be set up across the country to deliver food and medicine to people in my position. He said: “Nobody needs to worry about getting the … essential items that they will need.”

However, I’m sceptical. The omens so far aren’t good. I’ve had to buy clean clothes for employees to wear around the house to protect me from outside germs. I’ve had to make masks for them out of old T-shirts. I’ve started to wash and reuse disposable vinyl gloves. At one point I tried to make my own hand sanitiser following a recipe I found online, before realising I did not have the requisite rubbing alcohol. If I can’t protect myself from my eight-plus employees moving in and out of the house all day, my chances of avoiding coronavirus are low. Talking to other disabled people, I know we are in the same situation – unable to safely cope without this equipment, but fearful we will be left without access to it.

The other problem Jenrick’s announcement does not address is that, in many cases, people are banned from using self-employed care workers, hiring friends and family, changing wage rates, or spending on recruitment if everyone falls ill at once. We may also be forbidden from altering our care plans. With my carers’ agreement, I would much rather they worked 24- or 48-hour shifts to minimise the number of people coming in and out of the house and, with it, my level of exposure. Whether I’d be permitted to use my budget in this way would need to be agreed by my funding body – and these agreements take time. Time during which I will be left at increased risk.

Meanwhile, contingencies are limited. For disabled people who use agency care, theoretically the agencies are responsible for also arranging cover. Failing this, I try my bank workers, but if they can’t work, I’m stuck. I am not funded to cover sick pay, and don’t yet know how the government announcements will impact on my employees. As it stands I know they might be forced to choose between coming to work ill and risking my life, or being left without income and unable to pay their rent. This is exploitative, unfair and creates a dangerous problem for everyone involved. Direct payments leave me with the responsibility of covering my own shifts – but these are different times.

Coronavirus exposes society’s fragility. Let’s find solutions that endure once it’s over | Kenan Malik Read more

Typically the local authority would be the provider of last resort, but with the introduction yesterday of the coronavirus bill, ministers can now suspend the key duties set out in the Care Act. Local authorities will not be obliged to provide care beyond that which protects human rights. Eligible needs do not have to be met – and, in theory, councils could cease provision of almost all social care. This would result in deaths. Disabled people are terrified that if our own care arrangements fall through, there will be no safety net to catch us. This rolling back of our rights is unprecedented, and how it will look in practice is uncertain. It seems clear, though, that the results of this change could be incredibly destructive.

To top this off, if we contract coronavirus and get sick, disabled people will not be able to rely on the NHS valuing our survival equal to that of others. Doctors will be forced to make assumptions about our likelihood of survival, or our quality of life. In Italy, reports suggest that people over a certain age, and people who have pre-existing conditions have been deprioritised, out of a desperate utilitarian need for ventilators and ICU treatment to be given to those deemed “most likely” to survive. Sadly it seems this will happen here. But we’re also afraid of what’s currently occurring: a series of small decisions leading to the removal of measures that protect our safety. We don’t need to wait for ICUs to be full before decisions are taken about our right to life – those decisions are already being made.

There's plenty more to do than watch TV | Nell Frizell,"When your child’s idea of a good time is licking bus windows, throwing toothbrushes in the toilet or seeing how far they can sneeze, little words like “contagious” and “virus” can take on a rather urgent tang. And yet, as schools closed on Friday, how are parents supposed to cope? Presumably we’re all going to be here for some time and there’s really only so much Peppa Pig a human can watch before turning into a living Goya painting. So here, with a little help from my Twitter friends, are just a few pointers.

If all else fails, dig a really impressive hole. If you have a big enough spade, you could build an Anderson shelter

First, you don’t have to be an expert in medieval history or thermodynamics to keep your child learning during a period of self-isolation. You can use clocks, watches and timers, for example, to learn about time. Similarly, you can use cake, pizza and oranges to learn about fractions (if, for any reason, you want to eat less than an entire cake or pizza in one sitting, something I am not prone to). You can also use daily activities such as timing a meal or fitting tupperware into a cupboard to practise quantities, spatial awareness and child labour. As an important side note, I had no idea until I had a small child quite how much they love cupboards and admin.

Keep reading. Unlike that other indoor activity that your mother told you would send you blind, you literally cannot do too much reading. If you want to go all out and turn the book into a play, or build the characters out of plasticine, or draw your own illustrations, then, well, all power to you and your elbow.

If you are lucky enough to have a garden, now may be the time to get into den-building, tent-pitching, picnicking, birdfeeder-making (out of old tins and seeds), minibeast hunting, gardening and – if all else fails – dig a really, really impressive hole. Damn it, if you have a big enough spade, you could probably build an Anderson shelter out there to fill with the survival essentials: plasticine, old spoons, bath toys and a poster of Thomas the Tank Engine. This may also be a good springtime opportunity for pressing flowers in big books, growing a moss garden, searching for “fossils” or “dinosaur teeth” (in our case, this is any old bit of stone or broken brick), making a leaf book and collecting sticks. It beats singing Baby Shark on repeat. Just.

What scientists know so far about the effects of coronavirus on children | Jonathan Ball Read more

Once the lockdown hits and we’re in here for the long haul, feel free to indulge your inner children’s TV presenter. Make papier-mache masks over balloons. Make papier-mache tea sets and have a pretend picnic. Hell, make papier-mache anything – we’re going to be here for a while. Try a spot of potato-printing (if you’re not stockpiling potatoes) with poster paint. If you live in a house with stairs: try rolling the ball down the stairs, “tobogganing” down them in sleeping bags, “rock climbing” up stairs using only your arms, jumping off lower stairs on to a cushion crash mat. Hide toys – in a tray full of rice, lentils or any other dried food you’re going to boil afterwards anyway; or around the house; in shaving foam on a plate – at the end of a trail set out in a treasure map. Maybe plan a party (needless to say just for those you live with) – Lithuania’s Independence Day? Woohoo! Get drawing those flags! Google traditional food! Learn the country’s motto. If you want to stay on the pandemic theme, you can even make your own soap (if you can find somewhere to sell you lye). The internet is awash with recipes.

If you’re really about to crawl up the walls, try @fiveminutemum on Instagram for more ideas, or @CosmicKidsYoga on YouTube for some guilt-free screen time and a bit of bending.

When all else fails, try a very very long game of sleeping lions. As in, 45 minutes per round. Make those little squirts sleep until June.

https://www.theguardian.com/international,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/britain-benefits-rishi-sunak-claimants-austerity,2020-03-24T06:00:25,The middle class are about to discover the cruelty of Britain's benefits system | Polly Toynbee,"Millions of people are about to discover something they didn’t know about British life. There is no longer a safety net. People who have paid tax and national insurance for years and never been near the social security system will be turning to it in their hour of need; yet far too late, like trapeze artists falling through the air, they will find that the net beneath them has been lowered dangerously close to the ground and is badly torn.

If these people once believed relentlessly misleading tabloid tales of benefit scroungers, they will have a rude awakening. They will find that when Iain Duncan Smith turned the screw on social security in 2012, he was right to warn claimants: “This is not an easy life any more, chum.” As if it ever was.

Many new arrivals will join the 60% of claimants falling into debt and rent arrears while waiting for payments

The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has done well to honour 80% of wages for those “furloughed” from shut-down businesses – up to £2,500 a month. No one knows how many that covers and at what cost, but it was a macroeconomic necessity. One worry is the incapacity of the HMRC workforce, with 15,600 staff cut and 157 local offices with local knowledge closed: can they pay the wage subsidy to companies in time to save them? Many firms could still close, sending millions into unemployment.

The 15% self-employed are urgently seeking a matching plan, with the Treasury under intense pressure for a rapid response. Most of the self-employed are low-paid: their median income is just £10,000, according to Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Some won’t qualify, if they have earning partners. But many will have been forced into sham “self-employment” by tax-cheating companies. They will be desperate – and angry. The Resolution Foundation wants them paid 80% of average earnings over the past three years – or they will work through illness, rather than starve on £94 a week sickness benefit, says the RSA Populus poll.

Let’s hope that injustice is fixed. But even then, watch the shock as millions fall on the untender mercies of the Department for Work and Pensions, to discover what happened to benefits in the past decade. While never over-generous, by 2010 Labour had greatly lifted living standards for low earners, especially for children: Gordon Brown’s tax credits raised a million children and a million pensioners out of poverty. Since 2010, according to new research by Kerris Cooper and John Hills, a professor at the London School of Economics, children have lost a quarter of the support they had; chancellor George Osborne and his successors took out a staggering nearly £40bn from benefits. Never “all in this together”, Osborne justified it by raining down abuse on low-paid families. The hypocrisy: as the current editor of the London Evening Standard, he ran Christmas collections for poor families! The Resolution Foundation predicts a third of children falling into poverty by 2023.

Some cuts were secretive, uprating benefits by a meaner CPI not RPI inflation rate, a four-year freeze, and axing council tax support. Some made a noise – such as the bedroom tax, costing some families £14 week for a spare room. An early case was a Hartlepool family whose empty room belonged to their recently deceased 10-year-old. Housing benefit for renters was cut brutally. Introducing the two-child limit was exceptionally unjust.

New claimants confronting universal credit’s obstacles may join the half who find themselves propelled to food banks. Many new arrivals will join the 60% of claimants falling into debt and rent arrears while waiting at least five weeks for first payments. As with HMRC, a stripped-down DWP workforce is at risk of being overwhelmed. Some talking to the Treasury are shocked to find its staff clueless about the meanness of a benefits system they have cut and cut again. That explains Sunak’s sudden extra £20 a week and slight easing of housing benefit: they had no idea.

UK state support for business and workers reaches new heights Read more

Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation, says people on £50,000 salaries have been anxiously asking him about benefits rates. They’re in for a shock, he says. Unlike the previous tax credit system, universal credit only allows savings of £6,000 (it takes steep deductions from savings up to £16,000). People hoping this is only temporary will be distraught at having to use up their rainy-day funds, often saved for years for a deposit on a home. The foundation is lobbying urgently to have this savings means-test dropped.

Hills says a couple with two children will get £266 a week. And take from that £115 – the average amount that housing benefit falls short of rental payments. Many new claimants will run up rent arrears. Expect them to plunge immediately into poverty, miles below the £384 minimum income standard for a family of four, says Hills.

Some singles will get a shock too. Under-35s will be living on £73, and only funded for a room in a shared flat, in the cheapest third of rentals in the area.

Many who see themselves as middle class will confront the reality of Britain’s nonexistent safety net. It is, says the IFS’s Paul Johnson, “extraordinarily low”. One piece of advice from all these experts I’ve talked to: apply immediately, to limit these delays and debts. “Too many will wait, borrow from family, deny it’s happening to them, feeling the stigma. Apply at once,” says Torsten Bell.

These millions discovering DWP brutality at first hand will no longer be deceived by the old poison shaming those on benefits as loafers, frauds and “not people like us”. Benefits offer penury, not a life of Riley. Rishi Sunak has been lavishly praised, not least for his empathic language: “We will be judged by our capacity for compassion”. But his compassion will be judged by how far he keeps benefit rates below the most basic poverty line.

https://www.theguardian.com/international,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/trumps-push-to-shorten-the-coronavirus-shutdown-proves-the-captain-is-flying-blind,2020-03-24T03:46:57,Trump's push to shorten the coronavirus shutdown proves the captain is flying blind | David Smith,"Due to social distancing, there were only two dozen or so reporters in the White House press briefing room on Monday, making it feel like a flight with numerous empty seats and lots of legroom.

But when Donald Trump let rip for nearly two hours, it was as if the captain had announced a sudden whim to land the plane on water while wearing a blindfold. We sat tight for an unnerving journey.

On a day that a hundred American deaths were reported, the US president made clear his intention to reopen the country for business much sooner than expected and, seemingly, sooner than medical experts believe to be safe. Everything we know about him suggests this impulse has been guided by Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the stock market, poll numbers, the imminent election and pure gut instinct. Not science.

To watch Trump talk himself into this rash action in real time from a seat 30 feet (10 metres) away was to witness the awesome and terrifying power of the American president over life and death. It is a solemn burden that he, the first White House occupant with no prior political or military experience, is uniquely unqualified to bear.

“Our country wasn’t built to be shut down,” he said at the halfway mark of his planned 15 days to slow the spread advice. “America will again and soon be open for business. Very soon. A lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. A lot sooner. We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.”

Trump signals change in coronavirus strategy that could clash with health experts Read more

So it is weeks or months?

“I’m not looking at months, I can tell you right now,” he replied.

It represented yet another violent policy swing. First, Trump told Americans there was nothing to worry about and the virus would disappear “like a miracle”. Then he spun 180 degrees and declared himself “a wartime president”, issuing federal guidelines urging Americans to limit social contact and stay home. Now, it seems, he is pivoting back to the original position.

Perhaps it was just coincidence that, on Sunday, Fox News host Steve Hilton told viewers: “You know that famous phrase, the cure is worse than the disease? That is exactly the territory we’re hurtling towards… You think it’s just the coronavirus that kills people? This total economic shutdown will kill people.”

Perhaps it was also just coincidence that, on Monday, the stock market dropped past its closing level on 19 January 2017, the day before he took his oath of office. The entire Trump stock gain is wiped out.

The economy had been booming with a record number of jobs, he said. “We can’t turn that off and think it’s going to be wonderful. There’ll be tremendous repercussions. There will be tremendous death from that. Death. You’re talking about death. Probably more death from that than anything that we’re talking about with respect to the virus.”

He pointed to the depressions and suicides caused by economic recession but did not present any evidence the death toll would be higher than from the coronavirus.

He did suggest the mortality rate from the virus is not as bad as initially feared. “The whole concept of death is terrible,” he said, “but there’s a tremendous difference between something under 1% and 4 or 5 or even 3%.”

Trump’s Pollyannish tone was jarring on day that people were dying and hospitals desperately running short of masks and other equipment. It made for a startling contrast with the UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, who announced a strict lockdown in Britain, and the draconian measures in place across Europe. It also begged the question of whether citizens would sufficiently trust him to feel safe returning to work or public places and whether state governors would have the final say in any case.

Trump vows to re-open US economy even as deaths from coronavirus rise Read more

Senator Lindsey Graham, usually a Trump loyalist, warned in a tweet: “There is no functioning economy unless we control the virus.”

But the president insisted “we can do two things at one time”, adding: “We have a very active flu season, more active than most. It’s looking like it’s heading to 50,000 or more deaths – deaths, not cases. 50,000 deaths – which is, that’s a lot. And you look at automobile accidents, which are far greater than any numbers we’re talking about. That doesn’t mean we’re going to tell everybody no more driving of cars. So we have to do things to get our country open.”

Yet last Friday, when the car accident argument was put to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, he said: “That’s totally way out. That’s really a false equivalency … I don’t think with any moral conscience you could say, ‘Why don’t we just let it rip and happen, and let X per cent of the people die?’ I don’t understand that reasoning at all.”

Like an insufficiently loyal apparatchik in the Soviet Union, Fauci was suddenly nowhere to be seen at Monday night’s briefing. The Guardian asked why. Trump said: “I was just with him ... he’s at the task force meeting right now.” Does he agree with you about the need to reopen the economy soon? Trump: “He doesn’t not agree.”

But the president was joined by coronavirus task force response coordinator, Deborah Birx. She noted: “I was not here over the weekend... Saturday, I had a little low-grade fever...”

Trump interjected “Uh, oh!” and cartoonishly recoiled to a distance. Attorney General William Barr smiled devotedly. Birx added: “I got a test late Saturday night and I am negative.”

Trump gave an exaggerated, “Phew!” Again Barr smiled. But the room did not erupt in mirth. The president also mentioned that his wife, Melania, had taken a test that came back negative.

Barr was on hand to discuss Trump’s executive order to stop hoarding and price gouging. “If you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house, this is not something you have to worry about,” the attorney general said. “But if you are sitting on a warehouse with masks, surgical masks, you will be hearing a knock on your door.”

In another reversal, Trump is dialling back his constant references to the “Chinese virus” amid media reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans. He said: “It’s very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world. They’re amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way shape or form.”

The briefing finished at 8pm. Trump and co-pilot Pence returned to the cockpit. We’re in for a bumpy flight. Gabriel Sherman, special correspondent at Vanity Fair magazine, spoke for many when he tweeted: “This is the first time I am genuinely scared. I must have been in denial before. But that presser changed everything.”"

Thank you very much for your commitment to the Guardian. We know how much you value independent Guardian journalism in these frightening and uncertain times. We are grateful that you have put your faith in us.

I write to you from London, with the vast majority of colleagues and many readers around the world working from home. With you, we are trying to face this unsettling moment with fortitude, and we’re remembering our history – the Guardian and Observer continued to publish throughout the 1918 flu pandemic and both world wars, and we will do our best to do the same during this global coronavirus pandemic.

Over the coming weeks and months we will put all our efforts into the following:

We will bring you the news and information you need about Covid-19, and the facts that can help you: we value expertise, scientific knowledge and careful judgment in our reporting. We know that you find the wild conspiracies of social media and noisy TV pundits off-putting and confusing; instead, the Guardian brings you the facts you can trust.

We will bring new perspectives and insights to help us understand how the crisis is changing how we live, eat, socialise, travel, connect and care for each other.

We will hold world leaders to account for their handling of the crisis, through investigative reporting and asking the right questions.

We will focus on the challenges facing the poorest: homeless people, workers in the gig economy, those who don’t get sick pay, those who can’t work from home. And we will bring you the personal stories of the people most affected: looking not just at the powerful, but those whose voices are often unheard.

We will pay particular attention to what it is like to be a health worker right now: are they getting the protection and support they need? We are committed to hearing what they tell us.

We will try to understand what’s happening in the economy, using our financial expertise and judgment to work out what the recession means for businesses and workers alike, and what the future holds.

We will bring you international perspectives on how different countries are responding, working out which approaches work best, and why, through our exceptional network of correspondents. In addition, our sizeable teams and localised editions of the Guardian in Britain, the US, Australia and elsewhere across the world mean you receive a truly global understanding of this unprecedented situation.

We will investigate why this pandemic has happened, understanding what caused it, so we can work out how to prevent it happening again. We will pull all our work together in a new weekly email newsletter which you can sign up to here.

We will listen to our community of readers: you are asking crucial questions, giving us invaluable insights into what’s happening where you live, and inspiring us with your acts of solidarity.

We will not forget that other issues still matter, most especially the climate crisis; our dedicated teams will continue to bring you their unrivalled reporting on the environment.

And, finally, we will bring some hope. With clarity and imagination, we will find a way to build a better society, and a new and fairer way to live.

At the Guardian, we believe that high-quality news should be accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford it. To those who have supported us financially over many years, thank you. Your contributions are helping to provide free, useful, regularly updated, properly sourced and accurate information for many millions of people around the world.

Thousands of workers from across the country will continue to gather on the Hinkley Point C nuclear site – but work on the £106bn HS2 project could be halted – amid differing approaches in the construction industry to physical distancing aimed at containing the spread of Covid-19.

Some of the 4,000-strong workforce at Hinkley, Britain’s biggest construction project, have raised concerns over an outbreak of coronavirus at the Somerset site after the government shut down restaurants, pubs and schools to contain the outbreak elsewhere.

Around 1,500 workers helping to build Britain’s first new nuclear plant in decades live in temporary shared accommodation, either on the site or nearby, returning to their homes across the country at the end of each rota pattern.

Almost all the remaining staff use bus services from nearby train stations to travel to the site, raising fears that the close proximity of staff working on the project could allow the virus to spread within the workforce and across the country.

The company behind the project, EDF Energy, said on Monday that it plans to take “extra steps” to safeguard the health of workers on the site after workers raised concerns over crowded buses and close proximity of the workers in the local press.

One Hinkley Point worker reportedly told Somerset Live: “When we get to the site, we have to clock in for our shift and there’s 600 of us who clock in and out at the same time. At this point, there are no hand sanitiser dispensers so you cannot wash your hands. There are also areas where people touch. You don’t know what germs are being spread as a result.”

The company said it plans to conduct body temperature checks on all workers entering the site to check for a fever and has banned handshakes to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. It also agreed to provide extra buses to halve the number of people travelling in each vehicle so that they can be seated at least two metres apart.

Work on the HS2 high-speed rail project is continuing for now but a spokesperson said that may have to change.

“Over the course of this week and into next, we will be reviewing the majority of works on our construction sites in line with government advice on dealing with Covid-19.”

Other major construction projects such as Crossrail and two major hospitals that were delayed after the collapse of Carillion, have set out plans to prevent the spread of coronavirus and will remain open for now.

The National Federation of Builders (NFB) said Britain’s construction industry was in an “unenviable position” between safeguarding workers’ health and averting an industry collapse similar to the 2008 financial crisis.

Richard Beresford, chief executive of the NFB, said: “Our industry does not want to stop working. Until we are told by the government to down tools, we will be doing everything we can to support the safest possible working environment.”

The government is understood to be wary about imposing restrictions on the construction industry, which is a major driver for Britain’s economic growth, at a time when the economy risks slipping into recession.

The construction sector contributes £117bn to the UK economy, or 6% of the total economic output, according to government data. The sector is also responsible for 2.4 million jobs or 7% of all jobs in the UK.

The Hinkley Point project alone is expected to generate £200m of value for the south-west’s economy every year by contracting local businesses – almost £4bn over the life of the project.

Dan Dobson, a Unite member, said workers on sites across the country feared speaking out or turning their back on a job because they were self-employed and had limited employment rights or protections.

“Workers turned up at their sites this morning and expected to be told to go straight home. Instead, they were told it’s business as usual,” he said.

“The government needs to close the non-critical sites and extend the wage support scheme to the registered self-employed, and they need to take those actions immediately. Construction workers cannot afford to miss out.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/international,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/24/salmonds-acquittal-could-make-him-the-snps-biggest-challenge,2020-03-24T06:00:24,Salmond's acquittal could make him the SNP's biggest challenge,"When Nicola Sturgeon addressed a private gathering of Scottish National party politicians at Edinburgh Napier University towards the end of August 2018 and little more than a week after the original sexual harassment allegations against her predecessor Alex Salmond were made public, she spoke frankly: “How we deal with this and how we are seen to respond to this will say a lot about who we are as a party and also about the country we are today and want to build for the future.”

Speaking outside the high court in Edinburgh on Monday afternoon following his acquittal on 13 charges of sexual assault, Alex Salmond suggested that the verdicts would ultimately say something very different about the SNP. He referred to “certain evidence I would like to have seen led in this trial”, which would now “see the light of day”. Sources close to the former first minister were already briefing his belief that Nicola Sturgeon herself played a role.

As Salmond’s supporters welcomed the verdicts, calling variously for unnamed heads to roll and an independent inquiry into the SNP’s handling of complaints, and the Scottish Conservative opposition at Holyrood described “a national political scandal with profound questions of integrity for the first minister and her SNP government”, it was clear that when the coronavirus pandemic has abated the issue will return to the top of the political agenda. The verdict brought the most significant case in Scottish legal history to an end – but it also marked a new chapter in a fight that could tear the party leadership apart.

A key Salmond ally, Joanna Cherry, the prominent MP who last year garnered plaudits for leading the successful legal challenge to the prorogation of parliament, said that Salmond should be allowed to rejoin the SNP “without delay” after his resignation in August 2018 to avoid causing “substantial internal division” as he put it at the time.

As he resigned, the former SNP leader announced that he had set up a crowdfunder to support his judicial review of the Scottish government’s handling of the allegations. He attracted more than double the initial target within three days after more than 4,100 individuals donated a total of £100,000, underlining the loyalty that Salmond continued to command among senior figures and also rank and file independence supporters.

It is often said that the SNP is a party like no other; that it is configured more like a family, led by a tight-knit group who have kept faith together across decades of public derision and unpopularity. Their loyalties were forged in opposition long before the party became the electoral force it is now. There have been some spectacular internal disagreements – changing policy on Nato membership in 2012, for example – and personality clashes. But these have always been eclipsed by the overarching project of independence for Scotland and a pragmatic recognition of the discipline and unity required to achieve that.

At the heart of the SNP family was the relationship between Sturgeon and her “friend and mentor”, as she so often described him, Salmond. He once described it as an “unstoppable partnership”. It now lies fractured beyond repair. By Sturgeon’s own admission, the pair have not spoken since July 2018. Strain and distress were etched on her face as she responded to the reports of Salmond’s arrest in January 2019. In the same month, Salmond accused Sturgeon of “rewriting history” after his pivotal role in the rise of the SNP was excised from the party website.

Older activists in particular reflect Salmond’s furious sense of betrayal that Sturgeon’s code of conduct for the Scottish government introduced in 2017 applied retrospectively to former ministers. It was as though the new code was designed to catch him out, some believed.

In court, Salmond set out his own firm conviction that witness A, a senior Scottish government official, had orchestrated the charges, encouraging a number of other women to make claims against him that they would not previously have done.

Much of the Salmond camp’s criticism is also directed at Leslie Evans, Scotland’s chief civil servant who drafted the code with Sturgeon, and her oversight of the initial sexual harassment investigation, which the Scottish government was forced to concede was “tainted by apparent bias”, and whose role cannot escape tough scrutiny in the forthcoming parliamentary inquiry.

There is also a significant intersection between those who have spoken publicly in support of Salmond, those who are critical of what they consider to be an overly cautious strategy on independence, and those who have concerns about the Scottish government’s plans for transgender legal reform.

The forthcoming contest for the Edinburgh Central seat between two of the SNP’s most influential figures lays the divisions bare. Joanna Cherry is campaigning for the Holyrood seat, as is the SNP’s former Westminster leader and Sturgeon supporter Angus Robertson.

Robertson is known to favour a more gradualist approach to independence, while Cherry wants to test Holyrood’s power to hold a second referendum in the courts, and has meanwhile faced social media abuse for her opposition to SNP plans to bring in self-identification for gender recognition certificates, which resulted in a reported showdown between her and fellow MP Mhairi Black at a recent Westminster group meeting.

But there are many who dispute that the rift between Salmond and Sturgeon translates into an irreparable split in the party itself, arguing that this fundamentally misunderstands how the ground has shifted since #MeToo, especially for the tens of thousands of SNP members who joined after the first independence referendum, just as Salmond stood down as first minister. Their ambitions for independence, often strongly feminist and focused on equality, became ambitions for their adopted party, with many more women and LGBTQ+ activists becoming involved and demanding the SNP share their values.

Salmond’s behaviour once free from the restraints of office – bombastic pronouncements on independence, sexist jokes at the Edinburgh fringe and his long-running show for Kremlin-backed Russian broadcaster RT – likewise perplexed the expanded, modernised party. While it is impossible to overestimate Salmond’s impact on the Scottish independence movement, among many younger activists surveyed by the Guardian, their view of Salmond – brutal as it may be – is as a historical figure, “yesterday’s man”, and “irrelevant”.

Observers noted that since her election in November 2014, Nicola Sturgeon has been an unapologetically feminist leader, immediately appointing a gender-balanced cabinet and ushering in a significant change in style and policy. In 2015, she presided over the election of a new cohort of SNP MPs, many of them yes movement mavericks whose interpretation of party loyalty has been radically different from previous incumbents, and in 2016 the SNP group saw a gender and generational shift at the Holyrood elections.

But the response to Salmond’s crowdfunder appalled many independence-supporting women, who feared it would deter others from coming forward and that the case could become a lightning rod for existing sexism within the yes movement. Many anticipated the trial with dread, concerned that the proceedings would be politicised to the extent that the voices of the women involved would be drowned out. Following the verdicts, younger female activists tweeted their “disgust” at those seeking to make political capital from the outcome.

On the evening of the verdicts, the Twitter hashtag #ibelieveher was trending as Scottish Rape Crisis revealed a spike in calls to its helpline, prompted by the detailed reporting of the trial. Worries about in-fighting after the trial leaving activists disillusioned and demotivated are now academic since Sturgeon herself suspended independence campaigning and urged activists to focus on helping their communities through the pandemic.

Party insiders have always been realistic about the difficulties of moving cleanly on from the case with a parliamentary inquiry to come. But such a resounding acquittal for Salmond, and his immediate threat to release more evidence about the involvement of the Sturgeon government’s staff and senior officials in both the initial investigation and subsequent police inquiry, make the coming months all the more dangerous for her government.

When the criminal charges were first brought against Salmond, his anger had a ferocity that Sturgeon reportedly was unprepared for. Now some close to Salmond suggest that his sense of betrayal and desire for revenge will now have reached epic proportions.

Many have praised Sturgeon’s steadfast and humane leadership thus far through the national health crisis, but it is her predecessor who may yet signify her greatest challenge in the months to come."

Publishers of the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal have pleaded with the Chinese government not to expel their reporters, in an open letter published on Tuesday.

Earlier this month at least 13 journalists from the three major US news houses were ordered to leave China in an unprecedented retaliation against foreign media working in the country.

Tuesday’s letter said media had become “collateral damage in a diplomatic dispute” between the Chinese and US governments, and the expulsion of their journalists came at a critical time as the world responded to the coronavirus pandemic.

“We strongly urge the Chinese government to reverse its decision to force the Americans working for our news organisations to leave the country and, more broadly, to ease the growing crackdown on independent news organisations that preceded this action,” the letter said.

“The media is collateral damage in a diplomatic dispute between the Chinese and US governments, threatening to deprive the world of critical information at a perilous moment.”

Beijing has maintained the expulsion was a response to “politically motivated oppression” in the US government decision to classify Chinese state media organisations as “foreign missions” and apply tighter controls on them.

Three Wall Street Journal reporters had already been expelled, with Chinese authorities saying it was over a “malicious” column printed in the paper, widely seen as racist but which had no involvement from the three reporters.

The news organisations said it would have protested the expulsions under any circumstances, “but it is uniquely damaging and reckless as the world continues the struggle to control this disease, a struggle that will require the free flow of reliable news and information”.

“The coronavirus pandemic sweeping across borders, sickening and killing people in nearly every country, and sending the world economy into a downward spiral, is a global challenge unlike any other in our lifetimes,” it said.

“Perhaps more than any major news event in modern history, this moment underscores the urgent importance of both probing, accurate, on-the-ground reporting from the centers of the pandemic and of sharing the information, insights and lessons that reporting reveals as widely as possible.”

The expulsions prompted fear and condemnation for its implications on press freedom.

“By expelling journalists and keeping others in a state of visa uncertainty, China is overtly using its powers in an attempt to influence overseas news coverage, by punishing those who publish information authorities see as unfavourable and wish to keep quiet,” the Foreign Correspondents Club of China said.

Diplomatic ties between China and the US, which were already damaged by a long-running trade war, have disintegrated further in recent weeks as the two governments sought to blame each other for the virus."

A report from the £700m pension fund showed that almost a third is now being invested in low carbon and environmentally sustainable funds following calls from hundreds of MPs to align the fund with the government’s legally binding climate commitments.

The decision by the pension fund’s trustees to back a push for greener investment, first revealed by the Guardian last year, has resulted in renewable energy infrastructure investments making up 5% of the fund for the first time.

The move is a victory for the 360 serving and former MPs who have been pushing for the pension fund’s investments to fall in line with the government’s climate agenda.

The campaign was supported by all of the Labour party’s leadership candidates, the leaders of the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, and senior Conservatives including Guy Opperman, the minister for pensions and financial inclusion.

However, the pension’s trustees have stopped short of divesting entirely from fossil fuel companies and retain multimillion-pound investments in the oil companies Royal Dutch Shell and BP. The annual report showed that the fund has decreased its investment in BP by almost two-thirds in the past year, to £4.4m, and cut its holdings in Shell by a quarter, to £8m.

Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP behind the campaign, said the fund needs to fall in line with parliament’s decision last year to declare a climate emergency by divesting from all fossil fuels.

“Investing in clean energy is clearly the right thing to do, financially and for the future of our planet, so I’m glad the Parliamentary Pension Fund is doing this. But it has to also stop investing in Shell and BP,” she said.

“These investments cannot be justified on ethical, environmental or financial grounds, and they undermine MPs’ credibility in addressing the climate emergency. They have to stop.”

The trustees wrote to Lucas last year, in correspondence seen by the Guardian, to confirm that the fund would reconsider its investment strategy but adding that it may choose to remain investors in oil companies in order to have a “voice” at investor meetings and shareholder votes."

It might not show much of a family resemblance but fossil hunters say a newly discovered creature, that looks like a teardrop-shaped jellybean and is about half the size of a grain of rice, is an early relative of humans and a vast array of other animals.

The team discovered the fossils in rocks in the outback of South Australia that are thought to be at least 555m years old.

The researchers say the diminutive creatures are one of the earliest examples of a bilateral organism – animals with features including a front and a back, a plane of symmetry that results in a left and a right side, and often a gut that opens at each end. Humans, pigs, spiders and butterflies are all bilaterians, but creatures such as jellyfish are not.

'Wonderchicken': oldest fossil of modern bird discovered Read more

Dr Scott Evans, of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and a co-author of the research, said: “The major finding of the paper is that this is possibly the oldest bilaterian yet recognised in the fossil record. ​Because humans are bilaterians, we can say that this was a very early relative and possibly one of the first on the diverse bilaterian tree of life.”

Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Scott and colleagues in the US and Australia report how they made their discovery in sandstone at sites including fossil-rich Nilpena. They say careful analysis ruled out the possibility that the fossils were actually formed by the action of currents or from microbial mats.

The animal has been named Ikaria wariootia in reference to an Indigenous term for Wilpena Pound, a nearby landmark, and the Warioota Creek that is close to the sites of the find.

The team not only found burrows, but more than 100 fossils of the tiny creatures themselves – essentially impressions of the animal in the rock – an unusual discovery since Ikaria wariootia, like many other animals of the time, were soft-bodied.

That, the researchers say, is important: bilateral organisms are thought to have evolved during the Ediacaran period that stretched from 571m to 539m years ago, however previous evidence for such creatures has largely relied on traces such as the burrows they made.

While the creatures were tiny – between 2mm and 7mm in length – their form reveals vital clues.

“One major difference with a grain of rice is that Ikaria had a large and small end,” said Evans. “This may seem trivial but that means it had a distinct front and back end, which is the kind of organisation that leads to the variety of things with heads and tails that are around today.”

The team say analysis of the burrows suggests Ikaria wariootia would have moved through the sediment of its shallow marine environment rather like an earthworm, by contracting groups of muscles. Furthermore, it would most probably have had a mouth and anus connected by a gut and fed on dead animals and other organic matter – conclusions drawn from the current finds together with evidence from similar burrows discovered several years previously within the fossils of other animals.

“We also can see from the burrows that it targeted food and oxygen, which tells us that it had the ability to sense things in its environment,” said Evans, adding that this offered new insights into our oldest bilaterian ancestors.

Prof Simon Conway Morris from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, described the findings as exciting. He said: “Although the tiny fossils are near the limits of resolution they both tantalisingly suggest a creature very close to the earliest known ancestor of all advanced animals and, even more intriguingly, a likely association with small traces made as the animal forged through the sediment in search of food.”"

The Royal Ballet has said it will no longer work with its star choreographer Liam Scarlett, who had been accused of sexual misconduct with students.

The company said on Monday that Scarlett’s position as artist-in-residence at Covent Garden had ended and, as he would no longer work with the Royal Ballet, performances of his production Symphonic Dances would not go ahead.

It also said, however, that an independent investigation into his behaviour had concluded and “found there were no matters to pursue in relation to alleged contact with students of the Royal Ballet School”.

Scarlett, once described by the New York Times as the “new choreographic wonder boy of British ballet”, was initially suspended by the Royal Ballet in August after the allegations of sexual misconduct were made.

Rehearsals for a production of Oklahoma!, which Scarlett was to have choreographed, were delayed at the same time. The company said it was to do with problems with work schedules.

News of the allegations emerged publicly in January. The Times reported that the employment company Linda Harvey Associates was conducting an investigation into claims he had behaved inappropriately with students.

Queensland Ballet in Australia responded by suspending Scarlett as an artistic associate and cancelled productions planned for April of his show Dangerous Liaisons.

The Australian company’s artistic director, Li Cunxin, said this month it had not cut ties with Scarlett sooner because they were unaware the allegations against him were sexual in nature.

Cunxin told the Sydney Morning Herald: “It was very vague. We really learned from second and third sources [later on]. We are as eager to learn the facts as anyone. Because his ballet is widely performed all around the world, everybody is waiting.”

The artistic director said Queensland Ballet had conducted its own investigation and found no evidence of improper behaviour by Scarlett in Australia.

A spokesperson said: “The Royal Ballet Company has a code of conduct in place to ensure staff and visiting artists are always supported. To preserve the anonymity of the individuals concerned and as a duty of care to staff and artists, we are unable to comment further on the specifics of this case.”

Ipswich-born Scarlett, who has not responded to the allegations, was one of the Royal Ballet’s star dancers until his retirement in 2012. He was appointed as the company’s first artist-in-residence the same year.

His productions at the Royal Ballet included Vayamos al Diablo, Consolations and Liebestraum, Asphodel Meadows, Hansel and Gretel and Frankenstein.

Representatives of Scarlett have been approached for comment."

The body’s annual review of each state’s adherence to its social charter found that the UK was out of step with rights in six areas.

Criticisms in the report – which mainly covers the years 2014-17 – include permitting pain-inducing restraint techniques to be used in young offender institutions, the “inadequate” level of statutory maternity pay after six weeks and that family members of migrant workers are not granted an independent right to remain after exercising their right to “family reunion”.

The Council of Europe, which has 47 member states and is separate from the European Union, said the conclusions of its annual review are legally binding in the same way that judgments relating to the European convention on human rights have to be applied by member states.

The UK government, however, has traditionally shrugged them off on the grounds that they merely have to be “taken into account”. Virtually every country is criticised by the committee for violating regulations in some manner. Only Iceland was deemed to be in a state of total conformity.

On the criminal age of responsibility, the report said that it should be no lower than 14 years. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the minimum age of criminal responsibility is 10 years old; in Scotland it is 12.

The study noted that the number of children aged between 10 and 17 remanded in custody in England and Wales has fallen by 66% in recent years. However, the report said: “Sentencing children to periods of detention must be a measure of last resort, for the shortest time possible and subject to regular review.”

In terms of corporal punishment, the Council of Europe is critical of England, Wales and Northern Ireland where smacking, defined as “reasonable chastisement” remains legal; it was recently banned in Scotland.

On apprenticeship pay for young teenagers aged 16 and 17, the report said the wage levels have not been fair.

The report also expressed concern that “migrants and women with insecure immigration status” who experience domestic violence and rape “refrain from seeking protection and support services for fear of having their immigration status reported to authorities”.

On child benefit levels, it commented that “the amount of the child benefit has remained the same since the year 2009 and has therefore declined in proportion to the median income, in particular in relation to the second and subsequent children”."

A further $1bn could be cut in 2021, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said after a surprise visit to Kabul on Monday failed to persuade the two men to make a deal. Pompeo suggested the aid could be restored if they changed their minds.

“The United States is disappointed in them and what their conduct means for Afghanistan and our shared interests,” Pompeo said in a sharply written statement. “Their failure has harmed US-Afghan relations and, sadly, dishonours those Afghan, Americans, and coalition partners who have sacrificed their lives and treasure in the struggle to build a new future for this country.

Pompeo to meet Taliban in Doha in effort to revive peace talks Read more

“Because this leadership failure poses a direct threat to US national interests, effective immediately the US government will initiate a review of the scope of our cooperation with Afghanistan,” Pompeo added. “Among other steps, we are today announcing a responsible adjustment to our spending in Afghanistan and immediately reducing assistance by $1 billion this year. We are prepared to reduce by another $1 billion in 2021.”

The secretary of state warned that an array of other US projects, as well as US pledges at donor conferences, would come under review. He blamed the Afghan leaders for failing to abide by a joint declaration with the US made on 29 February, to send a unified team to talks with the Taliban, and to free Taliban prisoners.

In a separate agreement on 29 February with the Taliban, the US said 5,000 Taliban prisoners would be released in exchange for 1,000 government soldiers held by the insurgents. But the Afghan government insisted it had not agreed to free that many prisoners at once before broader peace negotiations had gotten under way.

Pompeo told reporters that the first cut in assistance could still be averted if Ghani and Abdullah changed course, formed an “inclusive team” and went ahead with the prisoner exchange. “We’re hopeful, frankly, they’ll get their act together and we won’t have to do it, but we are prepared to do that if they can’t,” he said.

After spending more than eight hours in Kabul in unsuccessful talks with Ghani and Abdullah, Pompeo flew to Doha where he held hour-long talks late on Monday night with the top Taliban negotiator, Mullah Baradar, at a Qatari air base.

Pompeo said that in contrast to the Afghan government, the Taliban were keeping their end of the 29 February deal. “They committed to reducing violence; they have largely done that, and then they are working towards delivering their team to the ultimate negotiations,” he said.

The rift in Kabul and the breakdown of a planned prisoner exchange with the Taliban have stalled progress towards peace talks following the agreement of the temporary ceasefire, under which the Taliban said it would not attack US troops as they withdrew from the country.

US and allied troops have begun their withdrawal but Taliban attacks on Afghan targets have almost returned to their pre-ceasefire level and there is no immediate prospect of political negotiations between the insurgents and government officials that were supposed to start on 10 March.

The two sides held talks via Skype on Sunday but there was no sign of a breakthrough on the core disagreement. The Afghan government wants a staggered release of prisoners but the Taliban are demanding that Kabul free all 5,000 of its fighters at once.

The official number of coronavirus cases in Afghanistan stands at 34 but testing there is limited and the disease is expected to be much more widespread, posing dangers of an epidemic among prisoners in particular.

“Everyone clearly understands the coronavirus threat makes prisoner releases that much more urgent,” wrote the US special envoy for Afghan peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad.

Pompeo staked his diplomatic reputation on the deal with the Taliban, which he signed in Qatar on behalf of the US. He took the decision to fly at a time when face-to-face diplomacy has been reduced to a minimum. The state department has urged US citizens not to travel abroad."

A man who alleged he was sexually abused as a child died after becoming trapped upside down at the top of a 280-foot chimney in freezing conditions, an inquest has heard.

Robert Philip Longcake, known as Phil, was deeply troubled by a police decision not to prosecute the sexual abuse allegations in the months before he climbed Dixon’s Chimney in Carlisle on 27 October last year, his inquest was told on Monday.

Longcake’s family told the Guardian in December that the 53-year-old had become depressed and withdrawn after disclosing that he had been sexually abused on a regular basis as a child in the early to mid-1970s.

He reported his allegations to Cumbria police on 3 August but nine weeks later the investigation was discontinued as officers could not find enough evidence to proceed.

On Monday, the coroner, Dr Nicholas Shaw, said Longcake had been “troubled so greatly” by the abuse and “the fact it could not be pursued would seem to have hit him so hard”.

However, Shaw said he could not be certain if the father of two had attempted to jump or had changed his mind at the top of the chimney when his boot became caught on the of the ladder at the summit of the building, which is as tall as the tower that houses Big Ben.

He said: “He deliberately placed himself in a position of extreme peril with the intent of taking his own life, but it is uncertain whether he took the ultimate step or he slipped and fell accidentally.”

Longcake, a crematorium officer from Carlisle, was brought down from Dixon’s chimney at 4.40pm on 28 October, almost 24 hours after he began climbing it, and pronounced dead shortly after, the inquest heard.

Police, firefighters, mountain rescue teams and the coastguard were involved with the operation to try to rescue Longcake.

His children Robert and Laura and brother John attended the hearing at Cumbria House, Carlisle, but his widow, Andrea, who the court heard was still struggling to come to terms with his death and who lost her father last week, was not present.

In a statement, Andrea said her husband started what seemed to be a mid-life crisis in April last year and spoke to police about childhood sexual abuse in August.

Longcake had attempted suicide in August and earlier in October, she said, describing him as “a good man, a good husband, a good father and a good grandfather” who had never done anything wrong until this year.

Recording a narrative verdict, the coroner said it was likely that Longcake died at about 8am. His cause of death was recorded as hypothermia and cerebral swelling due to inverted suspension.

'Fright of her life': Gold Coast woman finds five-metre python on her doorstep

As a seasoned snake catcher, Tony Harrison is used to the people the claiming there is a five-metre snake on their doorstep. But for the first time on Monday, the caller wasn’t exaggerating.

“This was the largest snake I have come across in 27 years,” Harrison said. “The poor old lady who opened the front door to see it there got the fright of her life”

The giant albino Burmese python was found in the Gold Coast suburb of Oxenford.

With the snake weighing more than 80kg, Harrison said it was lucky for him the reptile was good-tempered.

“Burmese pythons are from overseas, so he is obviously someone’s illegal pet … he had been in captivity his entire life, he is used to being held.”

But a missing tail and scars across its body suggested the snake had lived a rough life.

Burmese pythons are an illegal species in Australia. They aren’t venomous but if they escape into the wild, as this one did, they can wreak havoc on the ecosystem.

“It eats the food that our native species needs, in other words, competes with that native species, and there’s potential for introduction of viruses … a snake for America comes in and he can wipe out the Australian population,” Harrison said.

After the massive snake was bagged, Harrison’s first call was to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to collect the illegal animal.

The second was to his son Jensen’s school to make sure he got a chance to meet the impressive python.

“When we pulled it out of the car he couldn’t believe it was real,” Harrison said.” This is the biggest snake you will come across.”

Australia’s strict biosecurity laws mean that the python is likely to be put down.

“It was a bit sad … to be playing with it and having it in the back of our car, knowing that that’s where it is going,” Harrison said. “Within an hour of catching it, it was in the back of a biosecurity car.”

The maximum fine in Queensland for keeping a prohibited reptile like a Burmese python is $130,550."

There are three people in the foyer of the gallery grappling with a very large crate, easily two metres tall. “What’s in that?” I ask, edging around them. “It’s empty,” says the woman who seems to be in charge. “But it contained a sculpture called Elf Warrior. We’ve just set it up.” I ask why an elf would need such a big crate. “Because of its knob,” she says. “It’s huge.”

Upstairs in the gallery a little later, Sarah Lucas introduces me to Elf Warrior, a bronze arrangement of loose limbs curling around the base of one very long and upright member. “This is kind of a portrait of a friend of mine,” says the artist, who is taking me on a tour of Honey Pie, her latest show, which was about to open at Sadie Coles HQ in London before the coronavirus crisis closed the gallery. “He’s called Olivier, which means Elf Warrior.”

Not far away is Sugar, a cluster of breasts bound tightly together above two loosely dangling, pink-stockinged legs. The work is largely created from a sculptural material Lucas has very much made her own: stuffed tights. “Sugar seems to be a big favourite,” says the artist fondly. “She’s kind of like a bouquet of flowers. She’s pinkish so she’s sweet but she doesn’t look overly girly. Her nipples are tights stuffed with wool.”

Lucas points cheerily to another “knobby guy”, currently having an undercoat dabbed onto the giant protrusion emanating from what may be his loins. “That guy’s called Dick ’Ead,” she says proudly, as if introducing her best pal. “He’s going to go on that chair over there. He’s concrete. He’s going to be painted a dark red.” She picks up a colour palette and shows me the exact shade.

Honey Pie is the new chapter in Lucas’s Bunny series, originally conceived in the 1990s. The first sculptures in Bunny, largely made of found objects and stuffed tights, resembled female nudes reclining. They looked vulnerable and abandoned, as if they had collapsed into their chairs, or been dropped from a great height. In Honey Pie, however, the figures are more playful and colourful, almost cartoonish in their contortions – and they have seriously upgraded their wardrobes, particularly their shoes, which range from four-inch heels to platform trainers.

“They are definitely more exuberant,” says Lucas, as we move to Sadie Coles’s office to chat. “Bringing in colour is the new frontier for me. It’s just something I fancied doing. And I don’t know anything about fashion shoes. I just go online and put in high heels or something.” She points to a pair of nude shoes on a blue-stockinged figure perched on a chair. “Those are kind of Louboutins, or rather they’re Chinese knock-offs.”

The tights are a brand called Dorian Gray, which is quite funny

And the tights, will any old pair do? “It can be any tights,” she says. “It’s been a lot of tights. But actually in this show, funnily enough, I got all the tights from Mexico. They’re a brand called Dorian Gray, which is quite funny. Weirdly enough, you use a material because it’s any material you can get anywhere. Then you realise some are better than others. Mexicans are quite robust. You can see it in their artworks – you could call it heavy-handedness. But there’s an incredible strength in all Mexican things. This also applies to their tights. They’re stronger. I use much stronger wire now, too, which can defy gravity more.”

Lucas grew up in Holloway, London, the daughter of a milkman father and a mother who worked as a cleaner and a gardener. She has been called the wildest of the YBAs. Is that true? “I was pretty wild, but I wouldn’t say I was the wildest,” she says, suggesting that title actually belongs to her old friend Damien Hirst. “I was the next contender, probably, yeah.” She gives an infectious croaky laugh that speaks of late nights and roll-ups.

She felt frustrated that “the first wave of interest in the YBAs was all in the men” but she is now in the top tier of British artists, her work characterised by irreverence, bawdy humour and the use of “ready-made” objects – not just tights, but cigarettes, tabloids, food, furniture, lightbulbs, more cigarettes, and now flamboyant footwear. “After leaving home,” she says, “I was a squatter. I’m 100% a product of that, I still keep that mentality. If you came to my house, you’d see it’s moved on but it still retains elements of that ad hoc-ness.”

Her prevailing subject is the body. In 2015, Lucas represented Britain in the Venice Biennale. The pavilion was painted a yolky yellow, a nod to her obsession with eggs and their prevalence in early works, such as Two Fried Eggs and a Kebab. Within sat two large-scale sculptures called Maradona, one boasting a three-metre penis. Alongside these were casts of women’s bottom halves sagging into furniture. “A lot of people would have preferred it if I had not put cigarettes in their orifices,” she says. “But you know, I tried to make it fairly classic and at the same time completely new. Sarah Lucas, right? So the cigarettes had to be in there and I don’t find it offensive.”

She mentions she went out for lunch earlier today and the chat around the table had drifted back to the launch party for that Venice show. “I don’t remember a fucking thing about that party. I remember arriving and I remember leaving and getting the vaporetti home. But I don’t remember anything in between. I probably had considerable drinks. I think it was just because the whole thing was so overwhelming, right? It was just too much.”

At the time she spoke of feeling torn: there she was representing Britain, yet she did not feel particularly representative of the country, nor it of her. Does she still feel that way? “I don’t know. I mean, it’s such a complex thing. These days everywhere’s getting more and more the same. It’s the same with men and women, we’re more the same than we are different. In some ways, nobody loves Britain more than I do, or British humour, or British TV, or British books. I’m much more into British culture than I am anything else.”

As a remainer, though, she is no fan of the people currently deciding the country’s fate. “I can’t stand Jacob Rees-Mogg, even to look at him. I would describe it as harking back to a time irrelevant to now.”

By June last year, my hair had nearly all fallen out. I resorted to wearing wigs

She looks out of the huge windows, at the blue skies over the London rooftops, and notices a colourful bowl resting on the sill, shaped and painted to resemble an octopus furling its tentacles around itself. “Beautiful,” she says. “That’s a Kris Lemsalu.”

Lucas lives in rural Suffolk these days, with her partner, the composer Julian Simmons. Their house, nestling down a country lane, once belonged to Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears. “I still have a place in London,” she says, “so I’ve not totally given up urbanity. But quite truly, I am there more and more. To make these works, I got a studio in the town nearby. It’s a really historic town called Framlingham, but we just call it Lingham. It’s got a castle at the top, a beautiful church, a marketplace. Do you ever watch Detectorists? It’s set in that town.” She thinks the TV show does a good job of capturing the spirit and mentality of the townspeople.

“I grew up in London and didn’t have any rural connections. It’s been an adventure of its own. It feels really like home, but also kind of a retreat, a haven from the rest of my life – not just London but the travelling and everything else, with getting older especially.”

Lucas will be 58 later this year. How does the one-time hard-partying YBA feel about nearing her 60s? “It is a good question, and not having children doesn’t help you mature.” Do you ever wish you had? “No, not really. But a weird thing happened to me in October the year before last. I started losing my hair. I saw a tiny bald patch on my head, then gradually I started losing hair. It’s alopecia. By June last year, it had nearly all fallen out. My eyebrows had gone and everything. I’d resorted to wearing wigs a bit.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘I felt like I was disintegrating’ … Sarah Lucas. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian

“When I went to China in October for my next big show, I had a bit of white hair and still no eyebrows. But I remember getting to China, looking in the mirror, and seeing a dark shadow over my head. You can see I’ve got quite a lot of dark hair now, and some white hair, and my eyebrows have come back.”

She’s wearing it pinned up today and you’d hardly notice but she’s clearly still reeling from the experience. “It was dreadful, like disintegrating. And you don’t know if it’s going to come back. I had to go very rapidly through biting the bullet. It was a major upheaval and I’m sort of getting over it now. It’s made me feel a bit more accepting of myself as an old person. Until then, I hadn’t quite had to look it in the eye.”

When Lucas made her first Bunny, she described it as a “Eureka!” moment. Almost three decades on, that feeling of excitement clearly hasn’t left her. As we move back out into the gallery, she stands among her new additions, the stuffed-tights women and the knobby guys. Her eye is suddenly drawn to the pattern on the grey walls behind, which have a trace of white marbling up their surfaces. “It’s sort of like ejaculation,” says Lucas with a mischievous smile. “But maybe that’s just me.”"

Almost as soon as the schools close, we’re being presented with a colossal glut of no-fail kids’ entertainment. If you have children and can afford the subscription (£5.99 a month), it will be hard not to fall on Disney+ as your personal televisual childminder, grateful and weeping the moment it appears online.

My boys are five and two. So far – we yanked them out of school and nursery as a precaution last week when my wife’s health took a weird dip – our stay-at-home routine has worked. There’s some reading. There’s some garden play. I try to make them help me cook something every day, with wildly varying degrees of success. But the trickiest part has been screen time.

As we speak, I’m locked in battle with them over this. I want them to watch “good” things, such as CBeebies and Studio Ghibli films. They want to watch what they want to watch, which mostly consists of a single fan-made Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube video soundtracked by an objectively terrible 2014 Fall Out Boy song repeated over and over again for several hours. I cannot tell you how much I want Disney+ to solve everyone’s problems.

Fingers crossed, it should. The two-year-old is obsessed with elephants and the five-year-old is still fascinated with superheroes. For the former, Disney+ means that I can stop chasing Dumbo around the various streaming services like the guy from the Fenton video. For the latter, there are almost 40 Marvel shows, the overwhelming majority of which are animated (not to mention all the recent movies). Something vaguely wholesome, such as the 1981 Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends series, should keep him happy without turning him into a violent vigilante fascist, although at this point it’s basically damage limitation.

Disney+ claims that it will offer more than 500 films and 350 series, as well as 26 originals, at launch. But I cannot possibly allow myself to make it our primary form of entertainment, largely because everything about it is so heavily branded and relentlessly, insincerely, cultishly positive that it makes me want to tear my skin off with my fingernails and set it on fire. If we were to watch Disney+ every day, I am absolutely certain that we would all feel like we were drowning in treacle by the end of the week.

But these are desperate times. We’re going to be stuck inside for a long while yet, and our children are going to need as wide a variety of reliable entertainment as we can give them. If we can protect ourselves from the ickier strains of Disney’s suffocatingly ersatz optimism, there should be plenty here to keep everyone happy. Especially if it means I don’t have to hear that bloody Fall Out Boy song any more. Here’s a sample of what I hope will keep me sane during self-isolation.

Mickey Mouse Clubhouse

This 2006 animated show will have almost no appeal to adults or older children. It’s too bright, too repetitive and far too shrill. However, your preschoolers will probably lap it up. In every episode, Mickey and his friends confront an everyday problem and use cognitive, creative and social skills to solve it. Already, I’m planning for this to be my go-to if I want to keep the two-year-old in place when I need the toilet.

Bluey

A wildly popular Australian show in the Peppa Pig mould, Bluey is a bright, silly and fun cartoon about a family of dogs. It won’t turn your children into geniuses, but it may keep them at bay while you have a panic attack in the bedroom.

Forky Asks a Question

Now this one I am excited about. The plastic fork from Toy Story 4 harnesses his childlike naivety in order to ask big questions such as “What is art?”, “What is time?” and “What is cheese?” The running time – each episode is only three or four minutes long – suggests that Forky won’t receive satisfyingly thorough answers to his questions, but then again your kids probably won’t want to sit through Bronowski’s The Ascent of Man, so this will be a happy medium.

Be Our Chef

It’s a nuts-and-bolts cookery show for families. The plan is to make my kids watch this until they love cooking, and then they’ll want to help me cook dinner every night. This plan is absolutely doomed to failure, and I am prepared for that.

National Geographic

I’m going to lump all the National Geographic output together because I’m convinced that it will form the Eat Your Vegetables portion of our viewing habits. Shows such as Bizarre Dinosaurs, Brain Games and World’s Greatest Dogs all promise to balance education and entertainment in a way that will keep the children occupied and alert. And, if they need scaring, Free Solo is also available.

The Simpsons

And now my big plan. If I have my way, self-isolation will be when I finally force my children to love The Simpsons. I’ve been seeding it for a while, slipping Do the Bartman into YouTube rotation wherever possible, but now is when I can hit the mother lode. Every episode of The Simpsons ever made is on Disney+ (the company owns the Fox back catalogue). We could watch nothing but The Simpsons for weeks. Maybe we will watch nothing but The Simpsons for weeks. I promise that I will do everything in my power to brainwash my children into liking The Simpsons.

The Mandalorian

And then there’s The Mandalorian, by all accounts the best original available to watch on Disney+. My children are too young for it but, God willing, I’ll be able to watch it in the evenings after my kids are asleep and I’ve frantically caught up on all my work."

How did they do it?,"Last year one Oxford college admitted 96% of its students from state schools. How did they do it?

Erin Minogue has vivid memories of her Oxbridge application process. The words hard and daunting crop up frequently as she describes her journey from a Midlands comprehensive, then sixth-form college, to one of the most elite universities in the world.

Oxford has felt “one step removed from me”, she explains. “A friend of a friend had been, but I didn’t have any family reference points so it felt very tough.”

Now, about to sit her English finals, Minogue is a testament to one Oxford college’s stunning success in the rebalancing of state and private school Oxbridge entry, one of the most hotly contested issues in public education.

Only 7% of the school-age population attends fee-paying schools, yet typically between 30% and 40% of Oxbridge undergraduates come from the private sector. Attempts to redress this imbalance invariably lead to allegations of social engineering if private school pupils appear to be discriminated against, or unfairness and unconscious bias if the status quo persists.

Yet in the past two years Mansfield College has averaged entry from the state sector almost in line with the proportions who go to state schools nationally. The majority of students come from within the UK; 96% of the 2019 entry came from state schools, as do 90% of offer holders for this year’s admissions.

More significantly, the majority of those offers come from non-selective state schools and include a higher percentage of disadvantaged pupils, those from BAME backgrounds and from areas with low progression to higher education than the rest of the university. So how have they pulled it off, and why can’t others?

According to Mansfield’s new principal, Helen Mountfield, they could. Mountfield is a barrister and former south London comprehensive schoolgirl – although from a middle-class professional family – who made it to one of the most exclusive colleges, Magdalen, in the 1980s.

She believes Mansfield’s success, whereby the college has moved steadily up the Oxford Norrington table from bottom in 2007 to fifth this year, is down to its longstanding outreach work, its approach of putting each applicant’s achievements in context and the college’s “authentic” culture.

“My answer to the social engineering point is that we don’t believe we are taking less clever people to make up for disadvantage. We are looking for the cleverest people from a pool where everyone is clever. We want the people who will walk out of the door as the finished article, not those who will walk in the door as the finished article,” she says.

A decision was taken two decades ago to reach out to the further education and sixth-form college sector, which meant the numbers from those sectors gradually increased so the Mansfield applicant pool is now about 80% state school.

The college employs two expert access officers and makes a determined effort to present itself as a place that is open; the website’s headline reads: “Open, Friendly, Welcoming. Mansfield has the highest state sector intake of Oxford”.

“Applicants don’t have to worry about being in a cultural minority here, or whether they would fit in,” says Mountfield. “There isn’t really a cultural minority here. People come from all over and with different backgrounds.”

The college also takes a painstaking approach to analysis of contextual data such as progression rates to university and levels of disadvantage in different parts of the country, GCSE and A-level results and free school meals (FSM) eligibility of each applicant’s school and whether they are care leavers.

Perhaps the most contentious element of the Oxbridge admissions is the interview. A recent report from the Sutton Trust showed that six private schools and two state sixth-forms accounted for more Oxbridge offers than 3,000 other state schools and credited the availability of expert advice and preparation for that success.

Mansfield College’s senior admissions tutor, Lucinda Rumsey, recounts one applicant explaining that the only interview she had experienced before coming to Mansfield was at Greggs bakery. She got in and graduated with a 2:1. Rumsey believes the interview process is a powerful tool for equalising access.

“The important thing for selection is good pre-interview information, prior qualifications and a reference from a teacher who knows the student well and has seen them develop. Then we are trying to work out if candidates have aptitude for a particular subject and will thrive at it.

“The interview helps us to do some nuanced work around that. Tutors as subject specialists are in a good position to assess potential. Almost all the applicants we get are well-qualified, and we have to make fine distinctions.

“If candidates start out very well prepared by their school for interview, we try to see past that. If they have come from a school that rarely sends applicants to Oxford and have had no preparation, we want to see past that as well.

“Some candidates can be inflexible in their thinking if we take them off their comfortable ground. Interviews aren’t only about getting a right answer but engaging with what is asked and thinking through a problem that it is difficult and unfamiliar.”

The colleges’ access officer, Sara Harb, whose family moved to the UK from Jordan when she was five, recently graduated with a first in history after coming to Mansfield from an inner London comprehensive.

“There were people at my school saying, ‘people from this school don’t go to Oxford’ but as soon as I got here, I realised everyone seemed friendly and normal and not geniuses or very posh,” she explains.

“People from less well-performing schools often have to work really hard to get the grades and my school didn’t have the right interview prep but the tutors made me feel settled. I felt I was being challenged in an academic and friendly way rather than being set up to get caught out.”

For the team at Mansfield, their 90% access rate isn’t the end of the story. Rumsey says it is only when she reads the grant application forms for undergraduates in need, often to stay in college in the vacation period, that she grasps the full extent of their challenges.

“In these Covid-19 times we see the starkly different home circumstances of students. We have students who are alienated from families, students who have been carers, share rooms with siblings, don’t have a desk or wifi at home,” she adds.

“For us the next step is giving students access to equal chances after they leave, social capital as well as educational capital, so networks, grants for internships.”

Dan Hall, a third-year undergraduate in PPE from a state school in Manchester, agrees that different education backgrounds also show up after admission.

“For me it was ‘wow I am here, got to make the most of the experience’ rather than focus on career stuff. It is only later on that you realise you are behind the curve because they have been on a different path from the start.”

Both Rumsey and Mountfield believe the whole university is making a cultural shift, with a more sophisticated understanding of how state school admissions can be increased, to which Mansfield is contributing. Last year the number of successful state school applicants to Oxford was 69%, up from 56% five years ago.

Rumsey says there is a lot more pride in the state school access issue across the university, with conversations focusing more on the impact of privilege than disadvantage.

“There has been a presumption in the past that the latter group are riskier. But once you have made this shift, and seen the impact, you know that isn’t true.”"

We have a great dynamic and have always had amazing sex. I have a foot fetish and told her about it from the start. She is totally OK with it and we have incorporated it into our sex life here and there. I understand that it is new to her, but I wanted to try some more things with her slowly, and I asked her if she can sometimes initiate. She has her own quirks and although I don’t quite like some of them, I let her do them anyway and sometimes initiate them because I know it brings her pleasure. But when I talked to her, she said that I made her feel inadequate by asking. She believes that there is no point because it would feel weird for both of us. But if she really liked me, wouldn’t she want to try to leave her comfort zone? Isn’t that what lovers are for?

Every couple must navigate the divide between each other’s tastes and idiosyncrasies … and not only regarding sexual behaviour. It is part of the task of deepening bonds between you and learning the rules of compatibility. During this process, the style of negotiation can become more like a power struggle. One or both partners might start feeling coerced, ignored or frustrated. You are still at a trial and error stage. You have not yet discovered each other’s limits, or even your own. Try to be patient because this process always takes time. And it has to be OK for either of you to say: “I’m not comfortable with this.” You will find that your experimentation will sometimes be acceptable to your partner, and at other times you will be shut down. Fortunately, you seem to understand that there will probably have to be quid pro quo in terms of tolerating each other’s “quirks”, in your words – but it is important to remember that there is a fine line between doing something you find distasteful out of love or a sense of duty, and feeling coerced and resentful. Keep checking in with each other to make sure important boundaries are not crossed.

Last week, English National Ballet livestreamed a class from the company’s new studios in east London (still available on YouTube, with more being added). It’s more than 20 years since I took a regular ballet class, but who could turn down the opportunity of dancing with the one and only Tamara Rojo, ENB’s artistic director and one of the world’s finest dancers? I pulled on some leggings, pushed back the table and repurposed the kitchen counter as a barre.

Rojo explains each exercise while a few dancers are spread out in the background. The sound and lighting in the studio aren’t great, but that doesn’t impinge on the pleasure of spying the latest dancer fashions, the many incomprehensible layers they wear to keep warm – puffy boots, shorty dungarees and Rojo rocking one full-legwarmer in red and black stripes. All of these are gradually shed as the class goes on, to reveal a ballet butterfly underneath.

The pianist strikes up and it’s straight into some tendus (pushing the foot along the floor into a point), then lifting the leg to make tiny circles in the air – if you’ve done a barre fitness class, you’ll know this special kind of torture. A great sweeping port de bras, bending forward and (supposedly) doubling over at the waist, sees my hamstrings yelp into action.

Inevitably, as the dancers’ quicksilver feet pick up speed, and out of nowhere Rojo’s leg whooshes effortlessly up to her ear, they leave me far behind. I stop to marvel at a backbend. It’s in the very fabric of a dancer’s art to make it look easy, and after you’ve watched a lot of ballet you can become a bit blase about this crazy level of athleticism. But to dance along with a class is to physically feel how exceptional their ability is, and to observe the details of their technique undistracted.

Apart from hitting my knee on the dining table doing a pirouette, this was a welcome interlude to the day. When you’re cooped up inside (or usually hunched over a laptop), even just standing up straight, lifting your chin and majestically sweeping an arm above your head fills your lungs with air and your heart with peace. At which point the reality of current circumstances intrudes and my two-year-old bowls in demanding, “I want a biscuit, mummy! I want telly!” and all that zen calm crumbles. Ballet’s spell is broken.

The New York City Ballet principal is streaming a daily class on Instagram from the kitchen of her family home, dancing to Taylor Swift and showing she’s an absolute natural as a teacher. (“No soft knees!” she brightly scolds her virtual pupils.)

Claudia Dean

The upbeat Aussie enthusiasm of former Royal Ballet dancer Claudia Dean has made her a social media star for bunheads. Her first attempt at a livestream crashed because it was so popular. More are in the offing, but in the meantime there’s a whole YouTube channel of tips and tutorials for all levels to explore.

Andrey Klemm

Andrey Klemm is the central casting version of a ballet master, a terse, straight-backed Russian, dressed in black. But he’s the real deal, and you can see him teaching Paris Opera Ballet étoile Amandine Albisson on his YouTube channel. The camera sometimes lovingly lingers on Albisson’s face and forgets the feet, so perhaps you’re not entirely expected to follow along.

McOnie Company

It’s not just ballet out there, of course. Musical theatre choreographer Drew McOnie has moved the popular classes he usually runs at Pineapple Dance Studios online to Instagram Live, every Thursday at 7pm.

Steezy

Even before the coronavirus outbreak there were plenty of places to learn to dance online. Steezy is one of the most comprehensive for street styles (popping, breaking, waacking, house, krump, dancehall) and has nifty controls so you can slow down the speed or see yourself in split screen with the instructor. It’s a subscription site but there’s a seven-day free trial, and, until Thursday, a free class every day."
https://www.theguardian.com/international,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/24/growing-up-in-a-funeral-home-couldnt-prepare-me-for-my-sisters-death,2020-03-24T06:00:25,Growing up in a funeral home couldn’t prepare me for my sister’s death,"When I say my entire life revolves around death, it is not hyperbole. I am director of the Centre for Death and Society at the University of Bath, one of the world’s only research centres dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of death, dying and the dead body. My father is also a retired American funeral director. My younger sister, Julie, and I spent hours and hours of our youth in the different funeral homes Dad worked in. We never actually lived in a funeral home, much to the disappointment of Six Feet Under fans worldwide, but we did grow up watching our father moving RIP floral arrangements around, or vacuuming a visitation chapel’s carpet, and frequently disappearing on Christmas mornings because someone had died the night before. This was all totally normal for us. Our parents had made a point of not hiding anything about death, funerals or dead bodies when we were kids.

In late July 2017, my sister was diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma multiforme brain cancer and underwent emergency surgery to reduce the tumour’s size. She then received multiple radiation and chemo treatments for the next year before dying on 29 July 2018, in Milan, Italy, where she lived with her family and worked as a schoolteacher.

Despite my lived experience and academic credentials on human mortality, I was completely unprepared for Julie’s untimely death at the age of 43. I was not unprepared in that way many people are wholly unprepared for a person to die. There was an element of that emotion, but I was raised to understand that any person, especially the people we know and love, unexpectedly die all the time. My own form of unpreparedness came in a different form: throughout the year that Julie spent living with brain cancer I constantly felt that I should intervene and ask about hospice care, to make sure that my sister understood she was dying – but for reasons I do not fully understand, I did not say anything until the very end.

I finally said something on the night of 13 July 2018, when I was with my sister in Italy and she asked me what was happening. I held her hand and did what none of her medical team had done and said what the counsellors kept telling my brother-in-law not to say – I told my kid sister that she was never going home to Wisconsin, that she was going to die in Italy, and that we would do everything we could to make her end of life comfortable. Julie died 16 days later.

What I remember most about this experience is my sister saying three things: (1) thank you for telling me, (2) I know I’m dying (we did grow up the same way, after all), and (3) I am glad you are the one who told me because I would do the same for you.

This was one of the last conversations I ever had with my sister. Julie’s health was rapidly declining by this time. She had already lost vision in her right eye because of the tumour, the left eye was on its way out, she was bedbound because of severe balance problems also caused by the tumour, and her hearing was failing. On the upside, she was not in much physical pain because a local hospice recently started providing her with palliative drugs and outpatient medical care. But even after the local hospice got involved, no one said anything about dying. It was a matter of days after our conversation that an ambulance transported my sister to the same hospice’s comprehensive inpatient facility for comfort care. Julie requested that she not die at home, contrary to the conventional wisdom on where people prefer to die, so my brother-in-law dutifully made the arrangements.

Two nights after I told my sister that she was dying, I asked if she wanted to talk on Skype with Mom and Dad in Wisconsin. She said yes, so I stretched out next to her on the bed and held up my laptop so we could all see each other. The conversation was short, mostly because it was difficult for my sister to maintain even medium-length, focused conversations by this point, but we did talk about how much we loved each other and how Julie understood she was dying and how unfair it all felt.

A common narrative around terminal illness often describes dying people walking peacefully toward death, exhibiting stoic acceptance. My sister was angry about dying. She fully understood and accepted that death was coming, there was no supposed death denial in her final weeks, but her exact quote to my parents was: “Dying sucks. It really sucks.” Julie just wanted a longer life. We did, too.

Neither my parents nor I could know it at the time, but this conversation on my computer screen was the last all four of us ever had together.

In April 2018, I was in Italy with my partner and parents for Julie’s birthday, and it was abundantly clear even then that the cancer and its associated treatments were aggressively dismantling my sister. Looking back at that time, I realise I made a mistake by not saying anything about end-of-life care and dying. But it was also Julie’s birthday party, and my partner is always reminding me that most people are not ready to hear the word “dying”. My partner is absolutely correct, and I understand all this, but I still struggle with balancing what I professionally recognise versus what I personally say.

The whole situation felt bleakly ironic, since being a funeral director’s kid meant death was our familiar friend. One of my earliest childhood funeral home memories is touching the dead hand of an older woman before her visitation started. I remember her skin’s distinct coolness as she lay in the casket, and asking my parents why the hand felt cold. They both explained that the woman was dead, and that a person’s body temperature changed after dying. Her hand was completely normal, they said. Dead bodies were completely normal, they said. And this was when I learned, at a very early age, that human corpses were not scary – they were just dead and cool to the touch. I also remember the blue polyester trouser suit that the woman wore, mostly because this all happened in the mid-1970s.

When my sister took her final turn and died, I was in Bristol, where I live, preparing to board a 4.55pm flight for Italy. This was on a Sunday. A mutual college friend, already at the hospice, phoned while I waited to board the plane and told me that Julie had died holding her husband’s hand. My niece and nephew had said goodbye the day before. The friend had texted me several times while I waited in the airport to say that Julie’s breathing had become more laboured, so I was not surprised when the final call came in.

I made sure during all the pre-death texting that our friend knew Julie did not want any resuscitation, should the hospice decide to take measures keeping her alive. Everyone around Julie agreed on this point, and it would be strange to see a hospice make such a move, but my brotherly protectiveness took hold and I needed to make sure that my sister remained dead if and when she died. Communicating all this over text messages was surreal, but I also know it is how we humans die now. During that final phone call I kept repeating: “Do not move her body. Keep her body there. I want to see Julie when I get to the hospice.” Our friend said not to worry.

By the time I finally arrived at the hospice, my sister had been dead for several hours. The nursing staff had moved Julie from her room down to the hospice’s mortuaria level. I know this because I saw “Mortuaria” on the elevator signs as I descended to the basement, making a mental note along the way about experiencing the world’s weirdest version of Dante’s Inferno. Two extremely compassionate nurses showed me to the private room and told me in halting English to take as much time as I needed. I used my restaurant-level Italian to thank them.

I took immense comfort seeing my sister this way. In that room. On that stainless steel. In a mortuary.

Stainless steel. That is the first thing I noticed when I walked into the room. My dead sister’s body laid out on a stainless steel table, next to a stainless steel counter complete with a sink and retractable hose. She still wore her hospice gown, and a shroud covered her lower torso. In the room’s floor, at the foot of the table, sat a drain. It took me two seconds, using my advanced-degree critical thinking skills, coupled with my experience growing up in funeral homes, to realise I was looking at my dead sister in the hospice’s prep room. The prep room is where a funeral director “prepares” a body for a funeral.

What I am about to say may not make sense, but I took immense comfort seeing my sister this way. In that room. On that stainless steel. In a mortuary.

This was our youth. We grew up in these rooms. I was far more at ease talking with Julie in that familiar stainless steel room, holding her hand, hugging her and kissing her goodbye, than if we had been in her hospice room. I spent around 45 minutes with my sister, reading her what I had written on the different planes and making sure she knew that I would look after our parents. It took me a long time to actually leave. I wanted nothing more than to sit for days and hold my sister’s hand and think about all the prep rooms we saw as children.

Late that night, as I left the hospice with everyone, I noticed that the lampposts outside the building all had advertisements for local funeral homes, or funebri in Italian. And not small adverts, I mean large banners that were impossible to miss. They reminded me of banners announcing Fourth of July parades or pride festivals, but designed by goth kids who went into marketing. I asked my brother-in-law if this was normal in Italy, because, well, I did not think you would see banners advertising funeral homes outside US or UK hospices. He said it was normal(ish) and just proved that Italian businesses knew where to find their customers. Then we started laughing because we both knew that Julie would think the funeral home advertisements were funny and that I must tell Mom and Dad about them. Rest assured, I did. They eventually took photos of the banners.

Julie’s funeral service took place in an exceptionally stylish and modern Italian funeral home. A kind of funeral home very different from the midwestern American ones we knew as kids, but a funeral home all the same. She always appreciated marble floors and modernist architecture; the Jesus stuff (as we both called it) not so much, but, you know, this was Italy. Julie and I used to joke about spotting funeral homes of any kind in any city before anyone else. “That’s a funeral home,” I would say or she would say, well before any visible signage appeared. Our friends would then look at us with slightly terrified bemusement, as if we saw Death silently creeping up behind them in a New Yorker cartoon. We just intuitively recognised these places.

My brother-in-law organised the funeral within hours of my sister’s death, contacting the funeral home and meeting with someone while I made my way to Italy. Funeral planning is emotionally difficult no matter the circumstances, but I could tell that my brother-in-law needed to make these arrangements on his own out of love and devotion. Besides, had I gone with him to meet the funeral director, I would probably have spent more time asking questions about how and why Italian funeral homes did certain things than actually focusing on my sister. He also made sure that the funeral home staff knew his deceased wife’s father was a retired American funeral director, and I got the sense that the unspoken code many American funeral directors follow when helping a colleague’s family – a look that says you have carried the dead for so many others, now let us help you carry your dead daughter – also applied in Italy.

My parents flew in that day from Wisconsin, and we collected them at the airport on the way to the funeral. That last goodbye is when my familiarity with death, dying, dead bodies, funerals, funeral homes, funeral directors, grief and bereavement, the academic literature on when a loved one dies and watching parents weep over their dead child became profoundly conflicted. I knew exactly what to do with my parents when we arrived at the funeral home and my death professional mode immediately kicked in. At the same time, I remember thinking that this experience of death was never supposed to happen – that my younger sister was never supposed to die first and that our parents were never supposed to see Julie dead. She and I occasionally talked about who would die first, Mom or Dad. But we never seriously discussed what would happen if either one of us died first. I say seriously because I bought a motorcycle in my early 30s during a pre-midlife-crisis moment, which meant my sister told me in no uncertain terms that she would kill me if I died riding it. I thought about that motorcycle a lot after Julie died and how unfair it seemed that despite my best efforts, I managed to live, while she died from brain cancer. Connecting the two is not wholly rational, but it is often the way a person thinks while holding a dead sibling’s hand.

Mom and Dad spent a long time with Julie in the private visitation room where mourners can see the deceased before the actual funeral. Then it was time to move Julie’s body, put her in the European-style tapered-end coffin selected by her husband, move the coffin to the funeral chapel for the service and close the coffin’s lid.

I had spent time with my sister in the visitation room the day before, after filing the death notification paperwork, and she looked good, which was a relief because I did not want to call my parents and tell them that the funeral home handling their dead daughter botched the job. It seems crass, I know, to describe “botched jobs”, but this was my immediate concern. If you grow up around funeral homes, then you know what poorly done body prep looks like. Julie and I certainly knew.

My sister was not embalmed. Embalming is relatively unusual in Italy, so she was placed on an electric cold pad that slowed her body’s decomposition. The funeral home dressed her in the clothes provided by her husband, applied cosmetics and styled her hair. Again, she looked good. In addition to funeral directing, my father also taught mortuary science for many years – specifically, funeral cosmetology – so trust me when I say that Mom, Dad and I spent a long time scrutinising how the funeral home prepared my sister for public viewing – in between crying and occasionally chuckling at the enormous Jesus crucifix above Julie’s head, which she would never have wanted.

Then the funeral happened. The neo-rococo chapel quickly filled to capacity, so people spilled out into the funeral home’s foyer and quietly listened. The floral arrangements contained many sunflowers and gerbera daisies, my sister’s favourites. Musician friends played music. And everyone told funny stories about Julie in both English and Italian, which many of the Italians found quite different from their usual, more sombre funeral practices but very much liked. Julie was cremated the next day, and her urn sat for many months on a family bookshelf in Italy so that her children could say hello to Mama.

I argued with myself for a long time over how to describe my sister’s funeral – in that way writers sit at a keyboard and talk to themselves, not realising other people can hear them, saying, “Make sure and describe your dead sister’s body but don’t make it weird.” As an academic, one of my aims is to understand all the physical tools and technologies humans use to make modern death and dying visible. Defined. Knowable. Experienced. So, for example, when I saw the electric cold pad keeping my sister’s body from decomposing, I automatically recalled the history of non-invasive preservation technologies used in funerals since the 19th century.

But when it came to Julie’s funeral, all I really wanted to say is that it happened. She lived. She died. Everyone laughed and cried. People instinctively posted things on social media. Language seemed impossible. Words were not applicable. For years I had read academic articles and books that quoted grieving people describing what I was now feeling, which meant I unintentionally prepared myself for Julie’s death, but also meant I simply wanted to say I get it now. I think I get it now.

But this one could | William Davies,"The term “crisis” derives from the Greek “krisis”, meaning decision or judgment. From this, we also get terms such as critic (someone who judges) and critical condition (a medical state that could go either way). A crisis can conclude well or badly, but the point is that its outcome is fundamentally uncertain. To experience a crisis is to inhabit a world that is temporarily up for grabs.

The severity of our current crisis is indicated by the extreme uncertainty as to how or when it will end. The modellers at Imperial College – whose calculations have belatedly shifted the government’s comparatively relaxed approach to coronavirus – suggest that our only guaranteed exit route from enforced “social distancing” is a vaccine, which may not be widely available until the summer of next year. It is hard to imagine a set of policies that could successfully navigate such a lengthy hiatus, and it would be harder still to implement them.

It is now inevitable that we will experience deep global recession, a breakdown of labour markets and the evaporation of consumer spending. The terror that drove government action in the autumn of 2008 was that money would stop coming out of the cash machines, unless the banking system was propped up. It turns out that if people stop coming out of their homes, then the circulation of money grinds to a halt as well. Small businesses are shedding employees at a frightening speed, while Amazon has advertised for an additional 100,000 workers in the US. (One of the few, and far from welcome, continuities from the world we’re leaving behind is the relentless growth of the platform giants.)

The decade that shapes our contemporary imagination of crises is the 1970s, which exemplified the way a historic rupture can set an economy and a society on a new path. This period marked the collapse of the postwar system of fixed exchange rates, capital controls and wage policies, which were perceived to have led to uncontrollable inflation. It also created the conditions in which the new right of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan could ride to the rescue, offering a novel medicine of tax cuts, interest rate hikes and attacks on organised labour.

The 1970s inspired a vision of crisis as a wide-ranging shift in ideology, which has retained its hold over much of the left ever since. The crisis involved a contradiction that was largely internal to the Keynesian model of capitalism (wages were being pushed up faster than productivity growth, and destroying profits), and an overhaul in the dominant style of business: out with rigid heavy manufacturing, in with flexible production that could respond more nimbly to consumer tastes.

There was also an important spatial dimension to the 1970s crisis. Capital abandoned its iconic industrial strongholds in northern England and the American midwest, and (with help from the state) headed towards the financial and business districts of slick global cities, such as London and New York.

For over 40 years after Thatcher first took office, many people on the left have waited impatiently for a successor to the 1970s, in the hope that a similar ideological transition might occur in reverse. But despite considerable upheaval and social pain, the global financial crisis of 2008 failed to provoke a fundamental shift in policy orthodoxy. In fact, after the initial burst of public spending that rescued the banks, the free-market Thatcherite worldview became even more dominant in Britain and the eurozone. The political upheavals of 2016 took aim at the status quo, but with little sense of a coherent alternative to it. But both these crises now appear as mere forerunners to the big one that emerged in Wuhan at the close of last year.

There is a grim truth at the centre of the present crisis that makes it feel closer to a war than a recession

We can already identify a few ways that 2020 and its aftermath will differ from the crisis of the 1970s. First, while its transmission has followed the flightpaths of global capitalism – business travel, tourism, trade – its root cause is external to the economy. The degree of devastation it will spread is due to very basic features of global capitalism that almost no economist questions – high levels of international connectivity and the reliance of most people on the labour market. These are not features of a particular economic policy paradigm, in the way that fixed exchange rates and collective bargaining were fundamental to Keynesianism. They are features of capitalism as such.

Second, the spatial aspect of this crisis is unlike a typical crisis of capitalism. Save for whichever bunkers and islands the super-rich are hiding in, this pandemic does not discriminate on the basis of economic geography. It may end up devaluing urban centres, as it becomes clear how much “knowledge-based work” can be done online after all. But while the virus has arrived at different times in different places, a striking feature of the last few weeks has been the universality of human behaviours, concerns and fears.

In fact, the spread of smartphones and the internet has generated a new global public of a sort we have never witnessed before. Events such as September 11 provided a glimpse of this, with Nokias around the world vibrating with instructions to get to a television immediately. But coronavirus is not a spectacle happening somewhere else: it’s going on outside your window, right now, and in that sense it meshes perfectly with the age of ubiquitous social media, where every experience is captured and shared.

The intensity of this common experience is one grim reason that the present crisis feels closer to a war than a recession. In the end, government policymakers will ultimately be judged in terms of how many thousands of people die. Before that reckoning is reached, there will be horrifying glimpses beneath the surface of modern civilisation, as health services are overwhelmed and saveable lives go unsaved. The immediacy of this visceral, mortal threat makes this moment feel less like 2008 or the 1970s and more like the other iconic crisis in our collective imagination – 1945. Matters of life and death occasion more drastic shifts in policy than economic indicators ever can, as witnessed in Rishi Sunak’s astonishing announcement that the government would cover up to 80% of the salaries of workers if companies kept them on their payroll. Such unthinkable measures are suddenly possible – and that sense of possibility may not be easily foreclosed again.

Rather than view this as a crisis of capitalism, it might better be understood as the sort of world-making event that allows for new economic and intellectual beginnings.

In 1755, most of Lisbon was destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami, killing as many as 75,000 people. Its economy was devastated, but it was rebuilt along different lines that nurtured its own producers. Thanks to reduced reliance on British exports, Lisbon’s economy was ultimately revitalised.

Britain had a head start on Covid-19, but our leaders squandered it | Devi Sridhar Read more

But the earthquake also exerted a profound philosophical influence, especially on Voltaire and Immanuel Kant. The latter devoured information on the topic that was circulating around the nascent international news media, producing early seismological theories about what had occurred. Foreshadowing the French revolution, this was an event that was perceived to have implications for all humanity; destruction on such a scale shook theological assumptions, heightening the authority of scientific thinking. If God had any plan for the human species, Kant concluded in his later work, it was for us to acquire individual and collective autonomy, via a “universal civic society” based around the exercise of secular reason.

It will take years or decades for the significance of 2020 to be fully understood. But we can be sure that, as an authentically global crisis, it is also a global turning point. There is a great deal of emotional, physical and financial pain in the immediate future. But a crisis of this scale will never be truly resolved until many of the fundamentals of our social and economic life have been remade.

This union was formalised last week with the opening of a “Libyan embassy” in Damascus. The alarming partnership has been forged almost completely without comment. What happens with Libya no longer seems to concern anyone. It’s as though the whole conflict has ceased to exist.

Libya is not the Middle East’s forgotten war, it is the ignored war. Having burned for almost five years now, the country has almost entirely collapsed, a situation which minimal political will could have prevented. Not even the unprovoked attack of Tripoli was enough to inspire action. Last week there was a statement from the UK, the EU, the US, Tunisia, Algeria and others calling on the warring parties to call a truce to allow the country to tackle Covid-19.

Alas, the city remains the theatre of a “civil war” despite participation from no fewer than 10 other countries. A humanitarian disaster looms as more than two million people remain in the city, suffering daily shelling, failing electricity thanks to an oil blockade, and threats to cut off its water supply. All the while the attacking parties use terms such as “Aleppo” to describe the lengths they’ll go to win this fight. The war that was often dismissed by policymakers as too-slow-burning-to-worry-about has now inflamed nearby hotspots, like the eastern Mediterranean, and looks likely to spread further still.

At its core, Libya’s war has been driven by the aspirations of regional powers, after its transition was hijacked by them

Europe seems unconcerned by the chaos and instability smouldering on its doorstep. The blind eye the western world is turning to Libya has allowed it to become the world’s main theatre of drone combat, with the UAE and Egypt introducing Chinese-made drones to the field of Middle Eastern warfare. Not only does this undercut America’s shortlived monopoly on military drone technology, it has also shown the world that Chinese drones, as well as other equipment such as guided artillery, are the cheap and effective alternative for proxy warfare. It is a foreboding symbol of the future of arms proliferation and the technological upgrade that smaller, regional conflicts are set to experience.

Libya has no shortage of prescience in warfare, but the use of different mercenary groups to fight in the country may just be the most disturbing development of them all. With active fighters from private military contractors such as Russia’s Wagner Group, to rebel groups from Chad, Syria and those press-ganged by the UAE from Sudan – not to mention the multitude of special forces teams and “military advisers” – this is a dynamic that will have terrible consequences for decades to come. It should be a lesson for all about what the future will look like as middling powers run amok in the absence of any normative powers or forces, who remain too myopic to advance credible solutions.

At its core, Libya’s war has been driven by the aspirations of regional powers, after its transition was hijacked and run aground by them. It is this dynamic that explains why the situation is deteriorating so rapidly and why the west is turning a blind eye to it. Khalifa Haftar is merely the local face of a regional project propagated from Abu Dhabi. His assault on the capital is the culmination of plans that began in 2014 for him to follow in the footsteps of Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. It is a crude attempt to put the Arab Spring genie back in its bottle, and although one can only speculate on the logic behind it, the ambition is clear for all to see.

But Libya is not Egypt, and this determination to shove a square peg into a round hole has only triggered a response from Turkey, which is adamant it will not allow the UAE to reshape the region in its own image. It is driving a dangerous race to the bottom, at an important intersection between the African and Arab worlds, and should be a wake-up call to those whose interests lie in stability.

Unfortunately, those who recognise the need for fundamental change in the rentier region we call the Middle East, are isolated. The US has been absent under Donald Trump, who will never strain relations with his “favourite dictator” or the UAE over Libya while he has bigger, Iranian, fish to fry. Meanwhile, Europe has relied on the US for so long that its foreign policy muscles have atrophied. In spite of the best efforts of Germany, who tried to bring order to the international scrimmage over Libya, there is only so much it can do alone.

Despite pretensions of creating a geopolitical commission, EU states lack the unity, will and savvy to engage the Gulf and risk lucrative economic partnerships over a situation that has not yet become an existential crisis for them. Even the UN has found itself deeply undermined. Peace plans are upended and UN staff killed or intimidated by the Haftar project without so much as a word from a west that is unwilling to make things awkward with the Gulf.

If Libya continues to be the ignored war, the humanitarian cost will skyrocket, and the contagion of instability will continue through regions that are unable to contain it. If Syria’s own tragic war augured how other powers would exploit the space left by a pivoting US, and Yemen’s war symbolised the shifting west/Gulf dynamics, then Libya is the conflict where the past decade’s geopolitical trends are coalescing to formalise the dystopia we’re stumbling into and for the most part, we’re none the wiser about it."

Not even an ersatz People’s PMQs with spoon fed set ups from Classic “Let the old and the vulnerable die” Dom. Because in the last few days it’s become clear Boris Johnson can’t even prepare properly for a scheduled presser. Only the day before he was telling everyone to keep 2 metres away from other people when he was standing about a yard from the government’s deputy chief medical officer. There was a time when he could just about manage two pages of A4 as a briefing paper. Now his concentration span can’t even manage that.

So instead a we got a six-minute televised address to the nation. Less chance of any unforced cock-ups and mixed messages that way. Telling people that they should try to keep their distance from one another but a day out to Skegness probably wouldn’t hurt hadn’t proved a spectacular success. So this time Boris tried to get serious. People should stay indoors, other than to exercise on their own or with family members, do essential shopping or go to work. It wasn’t a total lockdown, but as good as.

Quick guide UK lockdown: what are the new coronavirus restrictions? Show Hide What do the new restrictions involve? People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes: Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible

One form of exercise a day – for example a run, walk, or cycle – alone or with members of your household

Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person

Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will: Close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship

Stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with

Stop all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.

The weird thing was, he was only telling most people something they had already clocked long before him. It’s been the country nudging the government into action, rather than the other way round. After all, these were the sensible measures many had already taken. On the coronavirus, the UK has had two months to learn from China what was coming and to to make necessary preparations.

And in that time Boris had managed to do next to nothing, apart from taking a week off over the half-term recess to pick a wedding date and argue over baby names. Still, he must be running out of possibilities by now. What was seemingly incomprehensible to Boris was that people really were now more interested in saving their own lives and those of others than being able to have a drink and a snout with Nigel Farage, Tim Wetherspoon and other members of the Brexit libertarian death cult.

Earlier in the day during the debate on the coronavirus emergency contingencies bill in the Commons, Needy Matt Hancock, who’s aged so much in the last few days he no longer needs to be IDed in offies, had said: “The government had made the most comprehensive public communications plans in history.” Presumably he reckons recent messages to be the best since “a leech a day keeps the doctor away”.

Still, better late than never. At least he had now heard of the police: a security enforcement service that had caught him by surprise the day before, though his hymn to the NHS felt hollow from a government that had cut its resources significantly over the past 10 years. But this was a last chance to head off a catastrophe on the Italian scale.

Boris looked thoroughly miserable as he was making the statement. Not just because of the gravity, but because even he couldn’t escape the irony. Imagine a person who has built his entire career on being economical with the truth having to implore everyone to trust him. A prime minister who doesn’t even look as if he could tell the truth to his reflection.

All his life Boris has wanted to be Churchill. Now he has met his Dunkirk, he realises he just can’t do it. He doesn’t have the leadership. He wants to be loved too much. Inside he’s a ball of foetal need. The tousled hair is no longer endearing. Now it just looks shambolic. And the mind is as confused as the barnet. He’s never come across a difficult decision he hasn’t wanted to fudge. Marriages, affairs, Brexit. All compartmentalised away into a happy place where there are no consequences.

Being Draco the Lawmaker just doesn’t sit well with him. Now the lives of thousands of people are at stake, and he can’t bear the responsibility. He was only ever in it for the lols. He clasped his hands, as if trying to hold himself together, but his body is folding in on itself. Bags upon bags upon bags. Soon all that will be left is a pool of blubbery blob, its voice a faint echo of Rob Brydon’s “small man trapped in a box”. With the odd bit of Latin thrown in."

The narrative about coronavirus, fanned by the details of every sad death announced, was that the virus was mainly a concern for those over 70, or people with serious underlying health conditions. These were the groups initially urged to socially distance themselves. But we’re beginning to see that coronavirus can make some younger people seriously ill. Crucially, although the majority of younger people and children will develop symptoms little worse than flu, they could be invisible carriers of the virus – and play a key role in its spread.

When you can’t easily tell if someone has a cold or coronavirus, infection control is far more difficult

Compared to other European countries, the UK was slow in closing schools – waiting until there had already been 104 deaths due to coronavirus to take action. Studies from China showed children were rarely diagnosed with novel coronavirus, and therefore presumably had little role in the spread of the disease.

But most of the diagnostic efforts in China, especially in the early phases of the outbreak, were heavily skewed towards hospital admissions. The majority of hospitalised cases involved adult patients. Did this mean that children and young people weren’t infected, or merely that they suffered more mild symptoms, which were going undetected?

Like many of my colleagues, I could see no obvious reason why children weren’t being infected: this was a virus spread by the respiratory route, not through a process unique to adults. If significant numbers of children were infected and suffered very minor cold-like symptoms, then their potential to spread the virus was immense.

One of the key differences between the novel coronavirus and Sars and Mers is that people with Covid-19 may have only mild symptoms – making it more difficult to detect. With Sars, most people infected quickly developed pneumonia. Identifying and isolating people with severe symptoms is a relatively easy task, and this made infection control through case identification and contact tracing comparatively easy.

The current coronavirus is different. In more than 85% of confirmed cases symptoms can go undetected or be easily confused with the common cold of mild flu. Its biggest weapon – the thing that has, according to one study, allowed it to spread so easily – is this ability to cause mild disease in the majority of people it infects. When you can’t easily tell if someone has a cold or coronavirus, case identification and infection control are far more difficult.

Far from being uninfected by this virus, children could in fact be its unseen carriers, important links in community transmission chains. But there’s still an important piece of the jigsaw missing. While many of us suspect that children have a key role to play in this outbreak, hard evidence to support this belief is still lacking.

In perhaps the largest study of its type, Chinese researchers examined infection outcomes in more than 2,000 confirmed or suspected childhood cases of Covid-19. Just over half of the children had mild cold-like symptoms, or no symptoms at all.

Severe and critical diseases, where body oxygen levels are low and various organs are under threat, were seen in around 5% of the children studied, with the youngest (under one year old) most at risk. There are still significant gaps in this analysis. Importantly, most of these were suspected rather than confirmed Covid-19 cases. But this study does at least reaffirm that most infections in children are mild.

Judging from past pandemics, school closures can be an effective way to reduce the spread of a virus – particularly when they form part of a larger programme of social distancing measures. Every school day, children congregate en masse, often in close proximity, and then return home, taking with them any new infection they’ve picked up. Intuitively, reducing this cycle should help slow the virus.

The fight against Covid-19 is being waged street by street | Zoe Williams Read more

By assuming that the young and healthy weren’t at risk, the UK government may have underestimated the effects of coronavirus. Indeed, reports of hospital admissions show that even among younger people this is a virus that can cause serious disease. A study from the US shows that 38% of 508 patients hospitalised with coronavirus were aged between 20 and 54 (children under 19 accounted for less than 1% of the total admissions). Of these 508 patients, 121 were admitted to intensive care; nearly half of this group was under 65.

As with most things in this pandemic, the idea that coronavirus only threatens older people is an oversimplification. Younger people and children are less likely to die from coronavirus, but their mild symptoms could make them contagious carriers of the virus – and they are more difficult to spot.

There was mid-January, when human to human transmission of coronavirus was confirmed. Then later that month Hubei province hit 500 cases, the unprecedented lockdown extended to almost 60 million people, and the Lancet published a study showing that a third of patients require admission to intensive care, and 29% get so bad that they need ventilation. By the end of February, a sobering WHO-China joint mission press conference illustrated the massive policy response in China – and, on 29 February, the UK saw its first case of local transmission.

Hancock accuses those still socialising in UK of being 'very selfish' Read more

In the UK we have had nine weeks to listen, learn and prepare. We have had nine weeks to run outbreak simulations, set up supply chains to ensure sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, and bring about the availability of rapid, cheap tests. We have had nine weeks to establish algorithms to support contact tracing, and start mass awareness campaigns not only about hand-washing, but about the risks that the virus would pose to social and economic activity if not taken seriously by all. Countries such as Senegal were doing this in January.



The UK’s head start in managing the outbreak continued as our confirmed case count remained lower than our neighbours’. However, on 12 March, Boris Johnson announced that all minor testing and contact tracing would stop and passive self-isolation would be introduced for those with symptoms, all part of a herd immunity strategy supposedly endorsed by the “best science”. After a backlash from scientists, the government clarified that it was not explicitly pursuing herd immunity, but would be taking measures at the “right time guided by the evidence”, all according to a plan which it did not share with the public.



On 17 March, Imperial College released a study noting that it had revised the model the government had been using, and stating that suppressing the virus was in fact the best way to avoid a vast number of people dying. The earlier model did not include the ICU data shared in the Lancet on 24 January. Instead, it was similar, but much later information from Italy, that changed their recommendation.



So, at the end of week, the UK government did a 180-degree turn, reversing what it had said only days previously. It made the decision to take the same measures other countries had in order to delay the spread of virus: closing schools except for the children of key workers, closing pubs and other gathering places, asking households to self-isolate for 14 days and focusing on scaling up testing to 25,000 tests per day over the next month. However, capacity issues and lost time mean that testing will take time to ramp up, PPE supply chains are strained, and all while patient numbers continue to increase as we follow Italy’s path.



The twists and turns described above have created a climate where the public do not trust that the government is responding in their best interests. Many cannot say what the government’s strategy is, or are confused about how serious coronavirus is for their health. Communication during a crisis must be clear, transparent, open and responsive. The confusion over herd immunity, for example, has made people reasonably think that the government wants everyone to get the virus to protect the economy, that it is not taking more decisive action because this is not a serious threat, or that the government does not know what it is doing. None of these are the whole story, but such perceptions are certainly not helpful in a crisis.



We had a choice early on in the UK’s trajectory to go down the South Korean path of mass testing, isolating carriers of the virus (50% of whom are asymptomatic), tracing all contacts to ensure they isolate as well, and at the same time taking soft measures to delay the spread. Instead, we watched and waited, and whether it was academic navel-gazing, political infighting, a sense of British exceptionalism, or a deliberate choice to minimise economic disruption over saving lives, we have ended up in a position where we are now closer to the Italy scenario than anticipated, and are faced with taking more and more drastic measures.



Perhaps the delay was due to fears about a second wave of the virus, next winter. But why not then work on buying time for the NHS to prepare, for health staff to get PPE, to make testing available, to boost beds and equipment, to trial antiviral treatments, or get us closer to the point that one of the vaccine candidates being investigated might actually work. Why not use the time to learn more about reinfection by the virus, about immune response, which seems to affect who needs ICU care, and about who recovers spontaneously? To understand where this virus came from, whether it is indeed seasonal, and how it could mutate? Why give in at such an early stage unless the goal is to get through this outbreak quickly so that whoever is left can help get the economy back to normal? It is still not clear who exactly is advising the government, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, and what factors the prime minister and his colleagues are taking into account in his decision-making.



Where does all this leave us now? Given that we lost the window of containment several weeks ago, the only feasible path forward seems to be to put in stringent physical distancing measures to delay the spread of the virus. But these alone will not be enough. We also need to backtrack and start doing the mass testing, tracing and isolating that are integral to breaking chains of transmission. Putting these measures in place does not mean that we will immediately solve NHS capacity challenges, or that we will not see a massive rise in patients dying. They will, however, help to slow down the spread. We must also continue to push for the protection of the health workforce and frontline responders who are exposed to high viral loads. And we must race to make up for the time lost during two months of passivity.

The British Olympic Association is expected to add to the voices calling for a delay in the Games until next year when it meets today, with its chair, Hugh Robertson, admitting that if the virus continues as predicted: “I don’t think there is any way we can send a team”.

Dai Greene: Tokyo Olympic Games must be postponed | Dai Greene Read more

If there is a postponement it would be first time in the Olympics 124-year modern history, although the Games were cancelled in 1916, 1940 and 1944. There seems little alternative for the IOC with so many athletes are unable to train properly because facilities are shut and countries in lockdown.

Canada and Australia have already confirmed that they will not send athletes to Tokyo this summer, while the British and French governments have urged the IOC to make a quick decision.

That view is supported by British Olympic chiefs, especially given many of the 600 Team GB athletes who are due to go to the Olympics and Paralympics are unable to train as planned. Robertson said: “We can’t see any way that this can go ahead as things are constituted at the moment and I expect we will be joining Canada and Australia shortly.”

Pushing back the Games until 2021 is by far the most likely option. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, has conceded postponement is now a possibility if the Games could not be held in their “complete form”.

The IOC president, Thomas Bach, has said he will take the next four weeks to deal with the complex legal and financial problems before making a decision.

A growing chorus of British athletes, including Dina Asher-Smith, Britain’s 200m world champion, are voicing their frustration at the IOC. “Does this mean that athletes face up to another FOUR weeks of finding ways to fit in training — whilst potentially putting ourselves, coaches, support staff and loved ones at risk just to find out they were going to be postponed anyway?” Asher-Smith wrote on Twitter.

Dai Greene, the former 400m hurdles world champion, said he was having to flip tractor tyres on his partner’s farm and use bales of hay for box jumps to keep fit. “On Saturday morning, I went to recce the local 400m track by one of the private schools near where I live,” he said. “I even had a look at the fence and wondered to myself – can I jump over it?

He added: “The world’s athletes need answers now, not in mid April.”

Ed Warner, the chairman-designate of GB wheelchair rugby and a respected voice in British sport, said Bach had misjudged the mood of athletes by setting a four-week deadline on Sunday to decide the fate of the Games.

“The IOC has said it will make a decision in four weeks,” he said. “It hasn’t got that long. It probably has only got four days. The right thing for the IOC to do is to announce it will postpone the Games immediately – and then use the next couple of weeks to decide when it will be. Athletes have led the way on this and the IOC have trailed far them. That has to change.”

Warner also urged the IOC to heed the voices of Paralympians who are particularly worried about Covid-19. Athletes with a degree of paralysis from the chest downwards have reduced lung function, which means they are more vulnerable should they catch an infection. “Athlete welfare must always be our top priority,” Warner said.

Opposition to holding the event in July has risen sharply in recent days, with US Track and Field and UK Athletics among those calling for a delay. Brazil, Norway and Slovenia have also pressed the IOC to consider postponement but have not threatened a boycott.

The head of safety at the London 2012 Games, Lawrence Waterman, also urged the Games to be delayed, saying the need for precautions against coronavirus such as physical distancing and self-isolation means groups of people cannot be safely assembled to test the venues for crowd control.

“These games need to be postponed and the sooner the IOC and the Japanese government face up to this the better. It’s simply not safe to put the Games on during a global pandemic,” Waterman said. “People’s safety and health should come before the costs of delaying contracts.”

The veteran IOC member Dick Pound told USA Today the Games would be postponed, likely to 2021. “The parameters going forward have not been determined but the Games are not going to start on 24 July, that much I know.”

Pound said the IOC would announce its next steps soon. “It will come in stages,” he said. “We will postpone this and begin to deal with all the ramifications of moving this, which are immense.”"

Coco Gauff’s career is idling along with those of all her locked-down rivals, but her mentor, Patrick Mouratoglou, who has guided Serena Williams to 10 of her 23 grand slams, thinks the American teenager can win a major whenever the tour resumes.

“I can see Coco getting to a final and winning a grand slam,” he says, “and I feel she is not that far away.”

That is a serious – if hardly impartial – vote of confidence in a 16-year-old who has risen from 685 in the world 15 months ago to 52 when the WTA suspended the women’s Tour this month because of coronavirus. Tennis is tentatively scheduled to return in June, although it is more likely to reappear much later than that.

My favourite game: Venus Williams v Lindsay Davenport, 2005 Wimbledon final | Tumaini Carayol Read more

Mouratoglou has worked with Gauff at his academy in the south of France for six years but was as surprised as anyone when it took Simona Halep to stop her in the fourth round at Wimbledon last summer. Gauff was, at 15 years and three months, the youngest in the Open era to reach the main draw. Halep, in the form of her life, went on to crush his main client, Williams, in the final.

The French coach was less shocked when Gauff made another impressive run at the Australian Open in January. She beat Venus Williams for the second time in the first round of a slam, then the defending title-holder, Naomi Osaka, before losing, again in the fourth round, to the tournament’s eventual champion, Sofia Kenin, her 21-year-old friend and compatriot.

Mouratoglou is encouraged that Gauff is very much a work in progress. “The match against Sofia Kenin in Melbourne showed Coco needs to improve. Of course she does. She still plays at an incredible level and the self-belief she has is so strong that she can surprise and maybe win a grand slam. The Australian Open is gone, but why not another one?

“Coco’s tennis is already big. She has a lot of things to her game; a big serve, unbelievable backhand, she does a lot of things. She is able to come to the net. When it is a pressure point, she is able to go for it. She will also play a return volley to put pressure on her opponents.

“She already understands a lot of things in tennis, but still it is not enough. There is still some space for her opponents to win the points.

“Definitely there is still room for improvement. Her maturity is incredible at 16. That’s what stands out most for me. The ways she handles matches, it’s unique. But she is still only 16 and, when you are only 16, you still have so many things you need to improve, which is great.

“The players she has beaten in the slams – Venus Williams, Naomi Osaka – and making the second week of a slam again after making the second week at Wimbledon, at that age, having so much to improve, it says so much about her as a person.”

Gauff has won eight of 11 matches in three of the four grand slams and has placed herself alongside young contenders and champions such as Kenin, Osaka, the 19-year-old US Open champion Bianca Andreescu, Aryna Sabalenka, Elena Rybakina and Marketa Vondrousova.

Gauff, along with her peers, can do little more than work on her game and fitness while the global halt to sport expands by the day. She had hopes of going to the Tokyo Olympics in July, but that door is closing by the hour. However, the unscheduled tennis break could benefit a young player who is still growing towards physical and emotional maturity at extraordinary pace in an unrelenting environment."

Not in my young lifetime anyway, maybe some distant day when I was old and grey, and athletics had changed out of all recognition.

Remember watching him set it at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996? That idiosyncratic style of his, back straight, carriage low, arms tucked, legs spinning so quick his gold spikes were like sparks from a Catherine wheel. He had a technique all of his own and maybe that explained why he was so fast. He finished in 19.32sec, three-tenths ahead of his own world record. The man in second place, Frankie Fredericks, ran faster than any one else ever had and he finished five metres back.

Over the next decade, no one got near. Tyson Gay ran it in 19.62, Xavier Carter in 19.63, Wallace Spearmon in 19.65. They were the second, third, and fourth quickest 200m sprints in history, and Johnson’s time was so far beyond them it was in another realm altogether. Three of the fastest sprinters in history, and they were pootling around in Olympus’s foothills. There was another wannabe contender, a 20-year-old lean streak from Jamaica called Usain Bolt – a lazy trainer, they said, but lightning quick in the juniors.

Bolt broke the 100m world record in May, two months before the Beijing Games. Then that Sunday night in Beijing, he did it again, in the Olympic final. You remember it, everyone does, how he started like a runaway armoire but gathered up so much track in the middle metres he stopped sprinting and spread his arms down wide, then turned to the crowd and slapped his hand against his chest as he came up to the finish line. There are lots of athletes who are so good they make winning look easy, very few so good they really find it so. He was one.

What is less well remembered now is just how upset some people got about it all, how the president of the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, called him out for “disrespecting his competitors” and said it wasn’t “the way we perceive being a champion”.

Watching in the Bird’s Nest stadium, it wasn’t the swagger that bothered me but the split seconds it had cost him. We didn’t know, then, whether Bolt would run that fast again – Johnson never did – which meant he, and we, might never find out what he was capable of, where his limits, our human limits, really lay.

Until four days later, when we found out.

Bolt explained he had not been bothered about breaking the 100m world record, since it was already his. The 200m mark, Johnson’s impossible 19.32sec, was the one he wanted. Some day, maybe, Johnson said, but not now, not yet. Bolt did not have the speed endurance, he said, or the technique to handle running the curve, not at the levels he would need to beat that time. And who knew better? So far all he had done was trot through the heats and here he was clowning around on the start line without a care in the world.

Then the gun went. His start was smooth and fluid, by midway around the curve Bolt had made up the stagger on the four men outside him, by the end of the curve he was metres ahead of them, and now it was just him racing history, chasing Johnson’s ghost.

Bolt was out there on the very limits of possibility, pushing, pushing, pushing. This time he did not slow, there was no early celebration, he even threw his head and chest ahead in a dip finish. The clock stopped on 19.30sec. He had done it by two hundredths. I remember thinking, up in the stands: “So this is what it looks like when God tries for the line.”"

A fixture in my Brixton local, he hadn’t been in since Christmas and the cancer did for him pretty quickly in the end. Nobody in the pub, not even those closest to him, had known he was ill because he seemed the type who probably didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for him.

A retired drayman, Del was a sweary old-school Londoner who loved his football, rooted for “those facking Gooners” and was England till he died. We’d even fallen out over it once; nothing serious, a clash of nationalities more than personalities. He knew this mick co-presented a Sunday morning radio show on TalkSport and always made it abundantly clear he tuned in whenever he could. Occasionally in the strongest possible terms.

More often than not, however, he came armed with a good-natured dig regarding anything he perceived to be controversially anti-Arsenal or England that I or my co-presenter Max Rushden might have said on air with which he disagreed. Our shared Sunday mornings in completely separate places meant we were never short of things to talk about when our paths did cross in the pub.

Shared experiences between people in completely separate places are quite the thing now, whether they are cyber booze-ups on Zoom, Mother’s Day meet-ups on Google hangouts or groups of friends staying in touch through the medium of gallows humour on WhatsApp. And as people struggle with the anxiety of uncertainty in these weirdly unprecedented times, it seems plenty find the familiarity of old friends, some of them people they have never met on the radio, weirdly comforting.

Sitting alone typing this column for a newspaper’s sport section at a time when there is no sport to write about, I am almost certainly not the only listener being kept amused by the sound of sports commentator Sam Matterface jovially bickering with his sidekicks – the former footballers Perry Groves and Stuart Pearce (each of whom I have met through work) – on a nearby radio.

With four hours to fill on a Saturday afternoon that should have been jam-packed with football action, the panel are instead discussing the profundity of their urbane and dapper host’s ignorance on the subject of what a “larder” is. The word had cropped up in conversation, Perry had been agog that Sam had never before heard it and now all three are arguing over whether or not having a room specifically devoted to food storage in your house means you’re “posh”. I am prepared to concede that maybe you had to be there.

Fast forward approximately 24 hours and Max and I have just come off the air after our two hours on TalkSport and, while tricky, it was highly enjoyable. Even in the absence of sport the show must go on and as purveyors of jovial, utterly inconsequential mid-morning tomfoolery we are apparently somehow considered key – if not absolutely key – workers at this difficult time.

During a frightening period when we have seen the very best and very worst of people, medics, shelf-stackers and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus have been rightly lauded for their heroic efforts. Meanwhile the challenges being met by a pair of idiots with hours of sports radio to fill and precisely no sport with which to fill it have gone unheralded. That’s OK, we’re not in it for the glory or the plaudits. What Nick Cave once memorably described as “this tumbrel – this bloody cart of severed heads and glittering prizes”.

There are those out there who will argue that filling time by “playing” the postponed FA Cup game between Sheffield United and Arsenal through the medium of a quiz is considerably less stressful than pulling 48 hours on the A&E ward only to wind up weeping in the car park of an empty supermarket. What’s more, they would be absolutely correct. Nevertheless, the fact of the matter is those questions didn’t ask themselves on Sunday, ultimately resulting in a highly controversial Arsenal win that comically enraged many listeners who support Sheffield United.

Meanwhile on the Guardian’s Football Weekly podcast, Max and I have vowed to continue delivering our twice-weekly show covering all the football that is not being played for as long as it takes and feedback has been heartwarmingly pleasing even if results have been mixed. A recent episode featured discussions about Australia’s A-League, Stuart Broad’s evolution as a top-class bowler and a monologue on the finer points of wood-chopping.

It is a privilege to be lucky enough to have radio shows and podcasts to look forward to producing in the company of likeminded individuals at a time when so many people have never felt so isolated, utterly bereft of companionship and downright bored. The inherent sense of camaraderie and community is a source of comfort and it is to be hoped our inane natter provides some sort of company and sense of familiarity to listeners whose ears are otherwise under constant assault from others engaged in far more important and largely depressing chat.

I suspect Big Del would have got a kick out of tuning in to radio coverage of Arsenal denying Sheffield United a place in the FA Cup semi-final in a preposterously complicated radio quiz, effing and jeffing throughout and making a mental note to remind me of how the Blades had been the victim of “a facking stitch-up” when next he saw me down the pub.

Although I never told him, I got a similar kick out of hearing from him and others who were out there tuning in to and laughing (or seething) at the latest drivel Max and I had dreamed up. With the world halfway to hell in a handcart, now seems as good a time as any to make sure each and every other one of our other listeners knows."
https://www.theguardian.com/international,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/23/polly-swann-continues-tokyo-preparation-in-isolation,2020-03-23T16:32:07,Polly Swann: 'We have to believe there’s light at the end of the tunnel',"Until last week, Britain’s rowers were some of the few sportspeople in the country still engaged in full‑blooded competition. Great Britain’s squad trials for Olympic selection were held behind closed doors but brutally fought. It was, says the Olympic silver medallist Polly Swann, one of the closest trial meetings she has experienced in her career.

Swann’s pairs race was a “real ding-dong” against a pair including her own housemate, Rebecca Shorten. Sometimes, she says, trials can be more stressful than international competition. “You have to try to beat your friends, and you know how much it means to them.” The 31-year-old Swann and her partner, Emily Ford, were squeezed out in the last 200m.

Tokyo 2020 Olympics in doubt as Canada becomes first team to pull out over coronavirus Read more

Swann is now off the water for the foreseeable future. On Saturday, Caversham closed its training facilities and moved all its athletes to at-home training programmes. Covid-19 had already caused the cancellation of all World Cup rowing and while the European Championships in June remains for now, the probable postponement of the Olympic Games is dominating the International Rowing Federation’s agenda.

Having recently completed the medical degree she began 13 years ago, Swann has no illusions about the seriousness of the pandemic and yet her desire to compete at the Olympics remains as strong as ever. “We have to believe there’s light at the end of the tunnel,” she says. “The Olympics is almost like a drug. That’s why athletes are able to put our lives on hold, move away from our loved ones, get up at ridiculous o’clock in the morning. So until there’s any kind of announcement that says there’s a postponement, we have to trust the Olympics will go ahead and we’d be silly not to do everything we could to prepare.”

Isolation plans for the rowers had already been drawn up: exercise bikes and rowing machines will now take up space in lounges or bedrooms but Swann is used to awkward training regimes. Having resumed her medical studies after finishing second with the women’s eight in Rio, a sense of unfinished business drew her back to the sport. Trying to fit a bursting schedule of hospital rotations, exam revision, gym work and sleep into each 24-hour cycle nearly broke her.

The week before her finals, a 5km indoor session left her in tears. “My coach was saying: ‘Polly, you’ve just got to do it.’ And I said: ‘I don’t know if I can.’ At the time it felt like the worst thing I’ve ever had to do. Now I’ve got a bit of perspective. It wasn’t a global pandemic, put it that way.”

Swann grew up in Edinburgh; her mother is a former midwife and her father is a doctor, providing frontline help during the crisis. Swann, who is not yet registered with the GMC and will need a training post before she can practise, never imagined doing anything other than medicine.

At school she showed some sporting aptitude, but her height made her “ungainly” – “I didn’t know where my legs and arms were in space and time,” she says, laughing. Struggling with hockey – she had an extra-long stick but still found reaching the ball on the ground difficult – she swapped to rowing and was quickly smitten.

Back injuries kept her out of contention for the 2012 Games; the following year, she found herself paired with Helen Glover, who had won Britain’s first gold in London with Heather Stanning. “We first got into a boat together in January of 2013 and I just remember being petrified,” says Swann, who remembers thinking: “‘Do not make a mistake.’” But Glover was a perfect mentor who “poured her heart into rowing” and by August that year they had won the world championships together.

When Glover reunited with Stanning for their second Olympic gold in 2016, Swann took a place in the women’s eight, who nearly pulled off one of the most dramatic comebacks seen on the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon. Up against a USA boat unbeaten for a decade, the GB eight’s strategy was simple: start fast and stay with them. They did neither. At the halfway mark Britain were last.

Swann remembers thinking all was lost when cox Zoe de Toledo made a bold call and began their sprint finish nearly a kilometre early. A surge of energy coursed through the boat, which soared up the field. “You get this all-encompassing belief from moving through the other boats,” Swann says. “Within 300m I was like ‘We’re going to win the Olympics.’

“We were coming hot and heavy on the Americans and then with 100m to go my legs gave in and my lungs were exploding. I could hardly move.”

USA took gold by two seconds but Swann and her teammates were thrilled with their fighting silver.

Swann still wants a gold but her attitude to the Olympics has changed. Desperate just to make the team in 2016, she feels Tokyo would be, by comparison, “a bonus – the one I get to enjoy”. Which boat she may compete in remains a matter for the selectors. Swann enjoys the art of pairs racing – “you really get to feel the glide of the boat and how to move it well” – but also enjoys the sprint style of the eight, a charge she calls “vicious and electric”.

The anxiety caused by the virus cannot be avoided – not in a sport overseen by a 73-year-old coach who must take special precautions to self-isolate as per government advice. Jürgen Gröbler’s charges had been joking he would probably self-isolate in a caravan by the side of the lake so he can keep an eye on them; now he’ll be poring over data from their machines. A natural extrovert who thrives on teamwork, Swann finds the prospect of physical distancing challenging but she already has plenty of her favourite tea in the house and has made a deal with Shorten that they will learn the guitar together.

Whether she can fingerpick by the summer is uncertain; whether the Olympics will happen even more so. But it’s a guarantee Swann and her fellow rowers will not sacrifice an iota of their training, wherever they have to do it. “We know the rest of the world will do the same,” she says. “And I think there’s something quite powerful behind that motivation.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/international,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/23/womens-game-is-now-riddled-with-uncertainty-for-clubs-and-players,2020-03-23T15:00:06,Women's game is now riddled with uncertainty for clubs and players,"Most players are on short contracts, and because of coronavirus some teams may also find themselves cut adrift by their parent clubs

It has been said repeatedly, recently, that football, like many other things, no longer exists in a bubble. No area of society is able to stay immune from this crippling disease. There will be casualties in every sphere of life. Football is no different. Women’s football is no different.

Amanda Vandervort, the chief women’s football officer for Fifpro, the global players’ union, said the coronavirus pandemic could be “a major setback to the growth and progress we’ve made as an industry” and called for a “smart and collaborative approach, a common vision that unites national strategies and implements regulatory interventions to ensure we minimise setbacks.”

Having spoken to sources at Women’s Super League and Championship clubs, a picture has emerged of the challenges clubs, players and the FA face in trying to mitigate an inescapable crisis.

Women’s teams in England operate overwhelmingly at a loss with, generally, parent clubs of varying financial strengths footing the bill. With clubs across the men’s pyramid facing the financial consequences of postponed games, it is inevitable women’s teams will, apart from those associated with the biggest Premier League clubs, be impacted.

For the majority of women’s teams, turnstile and other matchday income does not cover the cost of ground contracts or hire, staffing and travel. The broadcast rights for the women’s game are owned by BT Sport and the BBC, who cover their costs rather than paying for rights. This means postponements are significantly less impactful on women’s teams. The biggest losses will be felt through covering player, coaching and staff contracts through an extended season and a potential loss of sponsors.

They face the same questions as the men’s game. Who wins the league? Who gets a Champions League place? Who gets relegated? Who comes up? Except the financial implications of those decisions, or that of a voided season, are insignificant by comparison.

That puts pressure on the FA to maintain a united stance on the resumption, or not, across professional football; the Premier League, EFL, Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship. There is a logic to a united position: split things up and they could be accused of mixed messages at a time when clarity in society is sought after.

However, the huge sums of money involved in the men’s game and the consequences of season cancellations or premature conclusions are very different to the problems faced in the women’s. And, even with the best will in the world, it is impossible to not see the teams who have the most to lose or gain, those in the Premier League, dominating decisions.

There is widespread sympathy towards the situation the FA is having to deal with. It does appear that support for women’s teams may be on the cards, with clubs being asked to submit their expected losses and costs to the governing body.

An FA spokesperson said: “These are unprecedented and challenging times for all industries around the world and football is no different. We continue to work tirelessly with the football community, across every level of the game, to assess the impact of coronavirus, while taking the important steps to support the welfare of clubs, players, staff and supporters.”

The lack of a definitive decision on the season is stopping clubs from being able to plan for the future and provide answers to players and staff. On the other hand though, one source voiced concern that the outbreak could be a perfect storm for some clubs that would see it as an excuse to cut loose their women’s teams and that wrapping up the league now could prompt a dismissal of players and staff.

Either way, players stand to lose. Footballers in the top two tiers of the women’s game are rarely on contracts of more than one year. Bar a handful at the very top, they are not yet afforded the security of lengthy contracts familiar in the elite men’s game. With the majority of contracts ending in June, and some only paid until the season was set to end in early May, players have been anxious to learn their fates and it is not implausible that, should the FA seek to play out the league season, players could find themselves playing their remaining games for other teams.

Many players at Championship level on semi-professional contracts have second jobs and will also find their off-field employment impacted too. Scarily, these are players in one of the most secure footballing environments for women in the world.

Vandevort highlighted the extent of the struggle globally. “After speaking with a number of players over the past several days, a few things have become clear to me,” she said. “First, communication is all over the map and, for the players, crisis management is happening largely at a club-by-club level. Some clubs are communicating consistently and clearly with their players, while others seem to barely share any information at all.

“Second, there is a great deal of variance on whether clubs are allowing players to leave and return to their homes and families. In such a time of a global pandemic, players deserve the ability to make the choices that are best for their individual health and well-being. Lastly, we’re hearing situations where player contracts are already being cancelled, and others where clubs have already restructured their budgets to eliminate women’s football altogether.

“These times are unsettling and players are finding themselves in precarious positions regarding where they’ll be throughout the quarantine.”

Vandevort said players should continue to contact Fifpro, but is also keen to direct them to local player associations. “We welcome players to get in touch with us if they have questions, but as a first point of contact wherever possible, I’d advise players to first reach out to their domestic unions since they’ll be most familiar with local labour laws and domestic footballing environments. It’s also worth sharing that over the last few years many of the advances in women’s football have come when players and their national unions have worked together to achieve progress.

“From Denmark, to Ireland, Colombia, Chile, Cyprus, Spain and the US, women have achieved progress collectively. On an individual basis it can be challenging but with teammates alongside you can become much more influential and can create long-lasting positive impacts.”

It is highly likely teams will fold and players be discarded. Collective organising and experience sharing could be key in helping players navigate through this tumultuous period. Hopefully, clubs and governing bodies will rise to the challenge of providing support."

Football Federation Australia announced on Tuesday morning the competition would be put on hold for the foreseeable future with the “heartbreaking” decision to suspend competition to be reviewed on 22 April.

FFA remains optimistic of resuming the 2020 season at some stage, although CEO James Johnson admitted concern over the impact of the decision on the governing body’s finances.

On the horns of a dilemma – finding an A-League exit plan | Richard Parkin Read more

“As a national competition played in all parts of Australia, as well as New Zealand, mission complicated became mission impossible,” Johnson said.

“We will feel this. We will feel the financial pressure on the game at all levels. “The game will survive ... will we need to make changes? Be different? I say yes.

“Whenever there is a crisis we need to look for opportunities. Once we get through this, we need to look at what’s on the table.”

Monday night’s game between Newcastle and Melbourne City, won 2-1 by the Jets, proved to be the last for the time being, despite FFA’s hopes of playing out a condensed version of the season.

“To get so close to completing the competition, only to pull up a few weeks short, has been heartbreaking for the players, clubs and fans,” Johnson said. “That said, the health and safety of our fans, players, volunteers and staff has always been the overriding consideration for us.

“That is fundamentally what led – with the unanimous support of the state and territory member federations – to the suspension of grassroots football until 14 April 2020. Today’s decision was equally difficult to make but it is borne form the same rationale.

“As the largest club-based participation sport with nearly two million participants, we have a clear and obvious duty to play our part in doing whatever we can to support the efforts to slow down the spread of Covid-19.”

The A-League was one of few major sporting competitions globally still running at the beginning of the week, but the federal government’s advice on Monday against all non-essential travel within Australia effectively made the continuation of the season untenable.

The decision follows that of the NRL on Monday to suspend its season indefinitely, while the AFL had put its men’s competition on hold a day previously and cancelled outright the AFLW season.

The W-League season was able to be completed over the weekend, with Melbourne City crowned champions after the grand final was played in an empty stadium.

The decision to put the season on hiatus received the approval of the players’ union and Professional Footballers Australia CEO John Didulica said the break could be used to the game’s advantage.

“During the league’s pause, we can take some control back by ensuring the players can work with FFA, the clubs, the broadcasters and the government to collectively secure the professional game’s future.”"

At 3.24pm on Tuesday, it will be exactly 64 years since Devon Loch performed the most famous bellyflop in sports history. We’ve all seen some glorious examples of defeat being seized from the jaws of victory but, for sheer, sudden dismay, it’s hard to beat the horse who jumped all the fences in the Grand National, battled clear on the run-in and then fell over with just yards to go for no evident reason whatsoever.

Here’s the footage one more time:

I make it seven strides that the winner, ESB, takes from the point where he passes the capsized Devon Loch to the winning post. All that work to cover four miles and all Devon Loch had to do was take another seven strides …

Poetic Flare shows real promise as Irish Flat season gets under way Read more

In all my years watching racing, I don’t think I’ve seen a single other example of a horse doing exactly what Devon Loch did, so it’s very hard to know what happened to him and why. A popular theory is that he saw the wing of the water jump in the side of his eye and thought he’d better take off at the last second.

Some reckon he was shocked by the noise of the crowd, in full throat as it anticipated victory for a horse carrying the Queen Mother’s colours. Attendance would have been a lot bigger than the modern 70,000 in those pre-health and safety days, four years before the National was first shown live on TV.

Perhaps he slipped on a false patch of ground? It was reported that a stop cock was found leaking by the water jump and supposedly it had led to a damp patch on the run-in.

But, looking at the replay just now, I found myself thinking: “Cramp.” So it’s interesting to open the autobiography of his jockey, Dick Francis, and find these words: “In the actual second of his fall, I thought he had broken a hind leg, for he collapsed from the back, but when I found that he was unhurt, cramp seemed the only solution.

“Obviously, Devon Loch did not suffer from any prolonged cramp, for he was walking normally within two minutes of his fall, but a violent spasm equivalent to stitch seems a reasonable possibility. Veterinary opinion seems to be that it is so rare as to be almost unknown. On the other hand, a retired huntsman told me he used to ride a mare that did the same thing. She collapsed twice without warning in the hunting field while galloping, and after that he felt that she was more of a risk than a pleasure …”

Anne Holland also turned up some evidence in favour of cramp in her 1988 book Grand National: The Official Celebration of 150 Years. She quotes Alex King, who worked at Devon Loch’s yard, as suggesting that research at the time showed a link between human athletes taking glucose and suffering cramp. “We used to buy glucose for the horses by the crateful from Boots …. There was never a barrel of glucose at Fairlawne again after Devon Loch.”

Anyway, you can relive the race here and tell me your theories below. Once we’ve solved this one, we can crack on to the question of how The Lamb managed to change colour from his first National win in 1868, when he was grey to his second, in 1871, by which time he was nearly black.

The returning clinicians are one of the main elements of the NHS’s drive to expand its workforce in readiness for dealing with the large number of people the Covid-19 virus will leave seriously ill.

“These are difficult times and they have risen to the call of the nation’s needs and we know that many more will join them.”

Dr Kieran Mullan, the Tory MP for Crewe and Nantwich, is also returning to his role as a doctor in a hospital emergency department.

Former Lib Dem cabinet minister Sir Ed Davey said there were many qualified healthcare professionals in the UK’s refugee community.

He added: “I’ve spoken to a refugee charity, RefuAid, who says they have 514 qualified healthcare professionals on their books – people who are willing to work, fully qualified in their own country, but there are bureaucratic barriers to them coming forward.”

Hancock said he would examine the details, noting there was a need to make sure people were capable of doing the required work.

Local authorities filled 1.5m potholes in the 2019-20 financial year compared with 1.9m during the previous 12 months, according to the Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA).

Over the same period, councils’ average highway maintenance budgets fell by 16%, while the typical amount they paid in compensation for damage caused by poor road conditions increased by 17% to £8.1m.

It would take 11 years and cost £11.1bn to get all roads back into a “reasonable, steady state”, the researchers found. This is up from £9.79bn and 10 years in 2018-19, according to the analysis, which was based on council responses to an annual AIA survey.

The AIA chairman, Rick Green, said highway maintenance budgets had dropped to 2018 levels because councils were given only short-term cash injections.

“This stop-start approach has been wasteful and does nothing to improve the condition of the local road network on which we all rely,” he said. “In fact, it has just contributed to a rising bill to put things right.”

David Renard, the Local Government Association’s (LGA) transport spokesman, said councils shared motorists’ frustration about road conditions and were fixing a pothole every 21 seconds on average despite financial pressures. “Our roads are deteriorating at a faster rate than can be repaired by councils,” he said.

The LGA is calling for local authorities to be given devolved infrastructure and public transport budgets to ensure a funding allocation that covers five years.

The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced £2.5b of extra funding over the next five years to tackle potholes in England in his budget this month.



The AA president, Edmund King, warned this “won’t do the job”, adding: “With roads being resurfaced on average once every 76 years, we’d recommend lucky residents celebrate the moment as it truly is a once in a lifetime achievement.”

Steve Gooding, the director of the RAC Foundation, said: “Given the huge coronavirus spending pressures the chancellor is facing, now doesn’t feel like the right moment to demand a further boost on road funding.

“But looking further ahead to the post-coronavirus period, and the likely need to stimulate a deadened economy, this report should prompt government to consider committing to an ambitious maintenance initiative for the most important local roads.”"

Three teenagers have been arrested after an elderly couple were allegedly coughed at and assaulted in Hertfordshire.

Police said the couple were approached by three males before one coughed in their faces in Paynes Park in Hitchin shortly before 1pm on Friday.

One of the alleged victims, a woman in her 70s, sustained a black eye and was taken to hospital for a checkup before being released, according to a spokesman for Hertfordshire constabulary.

A man in his 30s who tried to intervene to help the couple also sustained bruising to his face, police said, and his vehicle was attacked.

Three males, aged 16, 18 and 19, were arrested and interviewed under caution before being released under investigation.

Police warned people not to post details of the case or footage of the alleged incident on social media as it could jeopardise future legal proceedings.

A spokesman said: “It has also come to our attention that there is footage circulating on social media and we would politely ask that people refrain from sharing the video for the same reasons.”

The incident in Hitchin came 24 hours after a man was arrested in the West Midlands after coughing on shop staff and claiming to be infected with the coronavirus. Officers had been called to Dudley High Street to reports of a theft on Thursday afternoon.

They detained a 57-year-old man on suspicion of theft and assault after several people reported a man coughing on shop staff who suspected him of stealing.

In a statement, West Midlands police said: “The man, who is from Dudley and has suspected mental health issues, has been taken into custody and will be questioned in due course.

“Those affected have been given appropriate advice and referred to the non-emergency NHS helpline for further support and guidance.”"

The government does not have the ability to send advice on coronavirus directly to Britons’ mobile phones, after repeatedly ignoring its own findings that an emergency messaging system could help the country in times of crisis.

South Korea’s aggressive use of emergency alerts has been credited by some for helping to keep the country’s infection rate relatively low, while many other European countries have built systems allowing governments to issue warnings about threats to life.

When politicians in the Netherlands became concerned on Sunday that too many people were flouting physical distancing rules and congregating in parks, they used their emergency messaging service NL-Alert to send a message urging the public to avoid congregating in open spaces and keep their distance.

veronica (@veronica2710) NL-Alert is our government's alert that warns and informs the Dutch people about an emergency. We receive an NL Alert for life and health threatening situations.... today we received the message to stay 1,5 m apart from each other and stay indoors when you’re sick! #Important pic.twitter.com/IyhpqePsQT

But seven years after the UK Cabinet Office conducted successful trials of an emergency alert system and set out how the country could build a similar system, there is still no sign of it being developed. So when Britons began congregating in parks at the weekend, there was no way to issue a formal warning to the public in real time.

Instead the British state is reliant on traditional media outlets and social media sites to communicate indirectly about isolation measures, competing with disinformation on messaging services such as WhatsApp. This has resulted in suggestions that mixed messages from ministers and a lack of a major public information campaign are hindering efforts to highlight the severity of the pandemic, with the government yet to take up the offer of free advertising space on sites such as Facebook.

Toby Harris, who has long campaigned for a UK alert system, said the British emergency messaging service had been a victim of inter-government squabbles and concerns over who would provide funding.

“It’s fallen between government departments as to who is going to pick up the bill, who’s going to lead on it, and all sorts of issues,” said Lord Harris, who highlighted the effectiveness of similar systems in Australia and Portugal for warning about risks from forest fires.

The Labour peer said the inability to inform the public of an impending risk to life was a major flaw in the government’s toolkit: “What is ridiculous is that you haven’t got the facility available.”

In 2013 the government concluded that “not only would alerts be seen as a useful service by the public but that it would also be an effective way of getting people to take specific protective action during an emergency”. Although the proposals focused on the potential for using the system to deal with environmental disasters or terrorist attacks, there is no reason it could not have been reconfigured to spread official health advice in serious medical emergencies.

The government’s communications strategy has come under fire in recent days, with some pointing to the prime minister’s sometimes mixed tone regarding the need to allow people to visit parks.

The NHS on Monday began sending text messages to many of the 1.5 million people considered to be at severe risk if they are infected with coronavirus, telling them to stay inside for 12 weeks. The health service’s ability to communicate with all of this group is limited by the lack of contact details, although it is aided by the fact that many in this category are receiving ongoing medical treatment for issues such as cancer. The industry lobby group Mobile UK also said it was in discussions with the government over ways it can help the fight against coronavirus, including the use of widespread text message campaigns.

Q&A How can I protect myself and others from the coronavirus outbreak? Show Hide The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.

Prof David Harper, a former chief scientist at the health department, said it was necessary to wait until post-pandemic scientific studies had been completed to have a full analysis of whether an emergency messaging system would be effective but there were reasons to suggest it may help risk management. “The demonstration in other countries, where people can be notified directly by text of where there were – or are – cases of Covid-19 … seems to have had an impact.”

He also said there were real concerns about the impact of disinformation clouding the public message and suggested the prime minister’s comments about the pleasures of going out in parks showed the importance of tone in public health warnings. “It’s not exactly that what was said was wrong – the intention is laudable. It’s the nuance,” said Harper. “Something was missing; it’s not the substance of what is said because people should be staying inside. To me there’s a relatively straightforward message but there’s clearly confusion.”

In addition to the enormous number of people tuning in to traditional television news broadcasts, many private media companies are taking matters into their own hands and ramping up efforts to communicate official guidance. Facebook is increasing the prominence of its coronavirus health advice within both its main app and its Instagram service, while Sky News has also started showing a video in its advertising breaks encouraging people to spend the time between news segments washing their hands."

In updated advice, the FCO said British citizens abroad who were resident in the UK should make urgent plans to cut short holidays and other trips and come back home straight away.

Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said: “We are strongly urging UK travellers overseas to return home now where and while there are still commercial routes to do so. Around the world, more airlines are suspending flights and more airports are closing, some without any notice.

UK doctors stuck abroad criticise Foreign Office for lack of help Read more

“Where commercial routes don’t exist, our staff are working round the clock to give advice and support to UK nationals. If you are on holiday abroad the time to come home is now while you still can.”

Officials fear anyone who delays may not be able to secure flights by the end of the week, leaving them potentially trapped far from home. However, critics of the government point out that many people are already marooned abroad because of travel restrictions in other countries and are in desperate need of repatriation flights.

Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, is seeking an urgent meeting to force a government repatriation programme with up to 1 million Britons stranded abroad with no commercial flights or no free seats running from countries such as New Zealand.

After New Zealand announced it was going into lockdown this week, a WhatsApp group of more than 300 people claimed the British embassy had been “appalling”, with airlines not taking calls or simply cancelling flights with no notice.

On Saturday, Raab announced he was laying on flights for more than 500 Britons stranded in Peru, after an avalanche of criticism.

The British government has also been criticised for allowing flights to continue from the worst hit countries such as Italy and Iran. However, Whitehall sources have defended the continuation of commercial flights, saying it is essential that Brits should be able to get home.

Doctors who are among those stranded overseas told the Guardian they were desperate to return to help their NHS colleagues battle the coronavirus outbreak but that they had received little help from the Foreign Office.

One doctor, who works at one of the busiest A&E departments in the country, said he was due to fly home to the UK from Pakistan on Sunday night but arrived at the airport to find his flight was cancelled and that they were stopping all international flights with immediate effect. He was told there would be no flights for another fortnight at least.

“At a time when doctors are being called out of retirement, and everyone is being asked to pull together and help amidst this crisis, I feel so helpless as I am stranded abroad with no means to come back home,” said the doctor, who asked not to be named.

One GP who is stuck in New Zealand with his wife, who is also a doctor, said he was “trapped” with no way to come back to the UK after travel restrictions were imposed. He said he tried to contact the consulate by phone and social media, and ended up taking a flight to physically visit the office in Wellington only to be turned away on arrival with nothing but a list of generic websites.

Another said he and his friend had gone out to New Zealand to work for six weeks in Auckland City hospital and Starship children’s hospital, but were stuck with no help from the embassy. “Our colleagues are fighting a war back home that we should be helping with,” they said.

The Foreign Office did not respond to the accusations about embassies, but said in a statement: “We recognise that any British people currently overseas may be nervous about the impact of coronavirus on their travel and their health.

“We are in close contact with travel providers and our international partners to provide support to those British people affected by ongoing measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.”"

The Labour chairman, Ian Lavery, has hit back at criticism after he was recorded saying the coronavirus outbreak gave the party a “great opportunity” to bring people together and get on the “front foot”.

His comments sparked outcry among rightwing commentators, Tory politicians and a former Labour MP. They suggested he should apologise for allegedly seizing on the crisis to make political gains.

Lavery claimed reports about the recording, obtained by rightwing Westminster blog Guido Fawkes, were misleading and he had been trying to rally grassroots party members to help their local communities and explain that Labour’s established network of campaigners had a significant role to play.

‘Corbynism without Corbyn’ will destroy Labour, says Wes Streeting Read more

Speaking to thousands of young members who joined an online chat forum on Friday night, the close ally of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was recorded saying: “By the way, when something like this happens, we’re going to see lots of our own dying as a consequence.



“But, you know apart from that, it’s going to give the fantastic battalion of Labour party members, community champions out there, a great opportunity of showing how Labour, and why Labour, is best when it gets on the front foot and best when it brings people together.”

Responding to the recording of Lavery, former Labour MP Ian Austin, who quit the party over the way it had handled antisemitism complaints, wrote online: “This is shameful.”

Lavery, who is MP for Wansbeck in the north-east of England, tweeted that he had been “extremely proud” of the Zoom call, which reached young party activists and that everyone had a role to play in trying to combat the spread of the virus.

He wrote: “We have a battalion of over 580,000 members and we need them to help in this crisis.”

In another Tweet he wrote: “Intentionally misleading reporting is really disappointing at a time like this. I’ve spoken about the opportunity for people to get out there and help their local communities and those in need. Nonsense to suggest otherwise. We all need to do our bit to get through this crisis.”

Young Labour, which organised the conference call, said more than 3,000 members had joined in, with Corbyn also taking part in the discussion. It is part of a series of mass calls being organised by the party to deal with Covid-19, including sessions on workers’ rights and mutual aid groups.

After Friday’s call, Young Labour tweeted: “The Labour party will continue to demand more from the government to support insecure workers and the most vulnerable, and Labour members in communities will be the centre of local support.”

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he was disgusted by Lavery’s remarks, accusing him of “salivating” at the thought of tens of thousands of people dying.

A former Tory MEP, Steve Bannerman, who was also a member of Ukip, tweeted: “This disgusting and naked opportunism shows why we suddenly have so many social media attacks on Boris and government handling of Covid-19. Shameful. @UKLabour – would Attlee have done this??”

Leftwing commentator and author Aaron Bastani said Lavery was simply highlighting that the response to Covid-19 would “demonstrate the uses of central planning and need for grassroots activism”."

An NHS intensive care doctor working on the frontline of the coronavirus crisis has moved into a motorhome to protect his three-year-old son who has cancer.

Nick Dennison is an anaesthetist at Frimley Park hospital in Surrey, but is now working as an intensive care doctor to help put the most ill Covid-19 patients on ventilators.

His son, Alfie, has recently started a three-year chemotherapy programme as he fights cancer, so Dennison made the difficult decision to move out of the family home so he can continue treating coronavirus patients without putting Alfie at risk.

“I have had to make the difficult choice: to do my job and save lives of people I don’t know, or to be with my son whilst he battles cancer,” Dennison said in a Facebook post that has been shared more than 90,000 times. “This virus is a big threat to his life and, as I am going to be exposed this week doing my job, I can no longer live at home.

“Later this week I’ll be moving into a motorhome and will not be able to take any further part in his care for the next 6 months.”



Alfie celebrated his third birthday last week and is suffering from lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune system.

“Alfie hopefully will survive his cancer and chemo, but many people will die from flu. My heart is broken making this decision, but I choose to save the lives of strangers and leave him in the care of my beautiful wife and family,” Dennison said.

On Sunday, Frimley Park hospital reported the deaths of five patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 and Dennison said the intensive care unit was already full, with 12 patients on ventilators after contracting the virus.

“My hospital usually has 4-10 patients on ventilators and is planning and EXPECTING 80 patients to require ventilation,” he added.

He said two of his ICU colleagues at other hospitals are off work after contracting the infection and fears he could soon be in a similar situation. “As healthcare workers, we are now EXPECTING to catch it despite PPE.”

His post finished with a plea to the public to socially distance themselves from others to stop the spread of the disease and ease the burden on the already stretched NHS.

“Pubs have been busy, offices open, social events happening, kids parties etc. It all needs to stop,” he said.

“Infected people shed virus and it must be everywhere by now. It is your social responsibility to engage in social distancing. Actions NOW can prevent further disease transmission, ICU admissions and deaths in 10-20 days. Bottom line. SOCIALLY ISOLATE or people die in two weeks.”"

The 30-year-old woman, who has not been named, has been sectioned, Greater Manchester police (GMP) said on Monday. The force said the criminal investigation was ongoing.

She was arrested on Sunday afternoon shortly after a girl was stabbed to death in front of her parents in Queen’s Park, Bolton. The woman was not known to the family, GMP said.

A member of the public reportedly chased after the suspect and pulled her off the girl, and detained her until police and paramedics arrived.

Russ Jackson, an assistant chief constable, said: “We have informed the family of the detention. They are understandably distraught over what happened yesterday and we will continue to support them with family liaison officers in the coming months.

“It is hard to describe how terrible this incident was. It happened in front of the parents of this little girl who had taken her out yesterday afternoon to enjoy the spring sun and play in the park.

“Having seen this horrendous attack, a member of the public bravely chased after the suspect and detained her until police arrived and made an arrest. I would like to thank him for his actions, which enabled us to quickly make the arrest and prevent anything else from happening.

“Several officers who attended the park were very young in service in the police, some with only weeks on independent police patrol. They and all the officers who went to the scene are incredibly upset over what has happened and all of us have this little girl and her family in our thoughts.

“I want to stress that this is not an end to the criminal investigation, we will consider the evidence and consult with the Crown Prosecution Service and if appropriate we will be seeking criminal charges.”

Mark Logan, the Conservative MP for Bolton North East, said: “I’ll be praying for the young girl’s family tonight, and fully support the police’s investigation into the motive behind this most inhumane of acts. Now more than ever we must come together for one another.”

Police said they had finished their forensic searches at the park on Monday afternoon but that the park was now closed as a response to the coronavirus pandemic."

The health minister Greg Hunt has asked for an urgent briefing about the clinical trial of a decades-old drug in the prevention of Covid-19, as countries race to find a way to prevent serious cases and slow the spread.

But infectious disease experts have warned the drug, hydroxychloroquine, is far from proven as effective in treating Covid-19 and that it could take several months for results to be conclusive. In previous studies for other conditions, hydroxychloroquine has been shown to cause heart damage and toxicity.

On Tuesday Hunt spoke about government support for two trials involving hydroxychloroquine, which is an anti-malarial drug also used to treat autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

Australia is crying out for clearer messaging on coronavirus, 'rambling' politicians told Read more

The first trial, announced one week ago and being conducted by the University of Queensland, is looking at whether a hydroxychloroquine and an HIV drug used either in combination or on their own can reduce severity and length of Covid-19 if given to patients with the virus early after diagnosis.

The second trial, being conducted by Melbourne’s Walter and Eliza Hall Institute and which Hunt said had “the potential for possible prevention” of the virus, will focus on giving 2,250 health workers around Australia hydroxychloroquine preemptively before and while they are exposed to patients with the virus. Researchers want to see if health workers taking the drug for four months are prevented from getting it.

Infectious disease physician Prof Marc Pellegrini is leading that study and said health workers were at the frontline of treating the virus so any preventative drugs would be valuable.

While hydroxychloroquine is effective for treating autoimmune conditions, Pellegrini said researchers were not sure exactly why it worked. They also do not know if it will have the same effect in viruses.

“The little bit we do know about the drug is it changes the way the cells make and distribute proteins, so we have speculated it might interfere with the ability of coronavirus to make its essential proteins,” he said. The trial is yet to receive ethics approval, but Hunt said the trial would be reviewed with urgency. Even fast-tracked, ethics approval can take six weeks and it would be up to six months before researchers had initial trial results, Pellegrini said.

The French, US, Indian and many other governments are rolling out trials for hydroxychloroquine in combatting Covid-19. The World Health Organization announced a large global trial, called SOLIDARITY, to find out whether existing drugs, including hydroxychloroquine, can treat or prevent the virus.

There are many benefits to looking at existing drugs to treat Covid-19, as they have already been tested and approved for use in humans, side effects are already known, and that means clinical trials can be conducted more quickly.

But there are good reasons media do not normally report on these clinical trials until they are complete and have undergone peer-review. Last week US president Donald Trump touted hydroxychloroquine as possibly “one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine”. He also said that “it’s not going to kill anybody”, and incorrectly announced the drug’s approval had been fast-tracked. Soon after a US man died after he began drinking chloroquine because he was scared of getting sick.

The US drugs regulator also warned the drug could do more harm than good. There is months, if not years, of research that needs to be done to prove that something that kills the virus in a test tube will be both safe and effective in Covid-19 patients. There is a real risk of building false hope in a drug that has not been well-tested for this particular disease. Evidence from trials to date has been inconclusive and other evidence has been purely anecdotal.

Dr Gaetan Burgio, from the John Curtin School of Medical research at the Australian National University, said “recent results from clinical trials indicated a possible improvement in shortening the duration of the infection”.

So you think you have coronavirus: what Australians should do if they are unwell Read more

“However the results are disputed and the clinical trials are inconclusive,” he said. “To date there are no clear indications that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are a treatment option. Additional clinical trials will tell us whether hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine are viable options for Covid-19 treatments.”

Covid-19 is an exceptional case because it is novel, is rapidly spreading, and countries are uniting to combat it, expediting ethics approvals for trials. Politicians are talking about these potential treatments almost daily, leading to media reporting on them, and the public, fearful of deaths, are hopeful for a cure.

Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician who has worked as an advisor to the World Health Organization, said there were no quick fixes. “If I got Covid-19 tomorrow, I wouldn’t want any of those drugs being tested [on me],” he said.

“It could help with treatment, it could do nothing, or it could be very harmful, and at at the moment we don’t know which of those statements are true,” he said.

“Hydroxychloroquine is quite a worry for two reasons, including that people are already using it when there are marginal benefits for it, and people can take too high a dose and experience toxicity. So often, clinical trials give preliminary results that look promising but in doing the proper larger studies you realise not only that it doesn’t work, but it does more harm than good.”"

'Staggering number' of human rights activists killed in Colombia, UN reports Read more

When cities across the country introduced local quarantine measures last week, three social leaders were killed, and as the country prepares to impose a national lockdown on Wednesday, activists have warned that more murders will follow.

Marco Rivadeneira, a high-profile activist, was murdered in the southern Putumayo province, Alexis Vergara was shot dead in the western Cauca region, and Ivo Humberto Bracamonte was killed on the eastern border with Venezuela.

Colombia is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for activists and community leaders, who often fall foul of armed groups fighting for territory.

Since a historic peace deal was implemented in early 2017 with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), a leftist rebel group, 271 activists have been killed. Now, with the government focused on the pandemic, activists say they are even more at risk.

“I’ve been getting more death threats since everyone started talking about coronavirus,” said Carlos Paez, a land rights activist in a cattle-ranching region near the northern border with Panama. “One message said that they know who I am – and that now is the time to take me out.”

Some of the armed groups are dissident Farc fighters who refused to hand in their guns; others belong to smaller rebel armies and rightwing paramilitary militias.

Whatever their purported ideology, all make their money in drug trafficking, illegal mining and extortion rackets, and all view social social leaders as an obstacle to those lucrative economies.

And as the government focuses its resources on stemming the coronavirus outbreak – which has now claimed three lives in Colombia amid 277 confirmed cases – normal security protocols have been thrown into disarray.

“They are playing with our lives because they know that our bodyguards, the police and the justice system are going to be even less effective they usually are,” said Paez. “It’s horrible. I’m scared for my life.”

Colombia’s war with Farc and other armed groups has claimed at least 260,000 lives and forced 7 million people from their homes. Now, with much of the country confined indoors ahead of a 19-day nationwide quarantine that begins on Wednesday, non-state actors are operating more brazenly.

Activists fear that a nationwide quarantine – to be imposed on Wednesday – has put them in a deadly bind. Moving around puts them at risk of infection, but staying in one place makes them sitting targets.

“We are being killed, like always,” said Héctor Marino Carabali, a rights activist in Cauca, who usually travels in an armoured car with a security detail provided by the government. “The government has taken drastic measures to fight the virus, but done nothing to protect us now or to tell us about how we can do our work. Curfews and lockdowns always affect the most vulnerable.”

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights last week reported that armed groups were continuing to commit brutal human rights abuses in Chocó, the province where Paez leads a community. Three people were beheaded, with one executed in front of their village, and a pregnant woman was murdered.

A coalition of local NGOs and over 100 rural communities called for a ceasefire among armed groups during the outbreak. “The emergency situation deserves our focus as a country and as a society to take on this challenge,” the communique read.

Many leaders and watchdogs have accused president Iván Duque of not doing enough to quell the bloodshed. They are not optimistic that will change as the virus spreads.

“Unfortunately, all critical issues in Colombia are being surpassed by the coronavirus health crisis,” said Gimena Sánchez, Andes director at the Washington Office on Latin America, a thinktank. “Coronavirus gives the Duque government more elements to excuse themselves from properly protecting social leaders and investigating cases of killings.”"

Although the majority of Italy’s population of 62 million are complying with the regulations, the interior ministry said on Monday that 92,367 citizens had been charged for breaking them since the lockdown was enforced.

Quick guide What to do if you have coronavirus symptoms in the UK Show Hide Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either: a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back

a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days.

If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start. Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days. If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days. If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible. After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine. If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal. If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.

Staying at home means you should: not go to work, school or public areas

not use public transport or taxis

not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home

not go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people. If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the NHS 111 coronavirus service to find out what to do.

One of the mayors said: “I saw a fellow citizen amiably jog up and down the street, accompanied by a dog that was visibly worn out. I stopped and told him: ‘Look, this isn’t a film. You are not Will Smith in I Am Legend. So, you have to go home.’”

Another said: “Where the fuck are you all going? You and your dogs … which must have an inflamed prostate?”

The death toll from the outbreak rose by 601 on Monday, an increase to 6,077 but a decline in the daily rate from 651 on Sunday and 793 on Saturday. Giulio Gallera, the welfare councillor for Lombardy, the region worst hit, said: “It is not the time to sing victory but we finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.”

The Italian government on Sunday banned any travel inside the country and closed all non-essential businesses to stem the spread of coronavirus.

Supermarkets, banks, pharmacies and post offices are among businesses permitted to keep trading.

Italians are banned from moving across municipalities other than for “non-deferrable and proven business or health reasons or other urgent matters”.

Prime minister Giuseppe Conte told La Stampa on Monday that “everyone’s efforts are needed as the survival of the social and economic fabric of our country is at stake”.

But “too many people are still out and about” despite the new lockdown rules, according to Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus. “I hope more rigorous norms can be applied,” he told Italian TV.

The Corriere della Sera newspaper reported that on Sunday police stopped 120 people from Milan who were trying to board a train to the south of the country.

Citizens must complete a self-declaration form to justify why they were leaving their home, with the only valid reasons being for work, health-related issues or to go to the supermarket.

One of the most serious transgressions happened last week in Sciacca, Sicily, when a man who had tested positive for Covid-19 was discovered by police while out shopping, despite the strict order to self-isolate at home. Another man, aged 60, who had also tested positive, was charged by police as he walked his dog in Lavinio, in the Lazio region.

Officers have also come across people who were dishonest on the forms, writing that they were “going shopping” when instead they were doing something else.

Roma Today reported on Saturday that two men went out to sell drugs. Others have written they went out for “love” so that they could meet their partners, and two women wrote they were visiting their elderly and sick aunt, who turned out to be a healthy woman in her 40s. Others said they were going to work, when in fact they were meeting friends for a game of cards."

Electric vehicles produce less carbon dioxide than petrol cars across the vast majority of the globe – contrary to the claims of some detractors, who have alleged that the CO 2 emitted in the production of electricity and their manufacture outweighs the benefits.

The finding is a boost to governments, including the UK, seeking to move to net zero carbon emissions, which will require a massive expansion of the electric car fleet. A similar benefit was found for electric heat pumps.

In the UK, transport is now the biggest contributor to the climate crisis and domestic heating has been stubbornly stuck on natural gas for much of the country.

Across the world, passenger road vehicles and household heating generate about a quarter of all emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. That makes electric vehicles essential to reducing overall emissions, but how clean an electric vehicle is also depends on how the electricity is generated, the efficiency of the supply and the efficiency of the vehicle.

That has made some individuals and governments question whether these technologies are worth expanding. The study, published on Monday in the journal Nature Sustainability, produced a decisive yes.

Scientists from the universities of Exeter, Nijmegen and Cambridge conducted lifecycle assessments that showed that even where electricity generation still involves substantial amounts of fossil fuel, there was a CO 2 saving over conventional cars and fossil fuel heating.

They found that in 53 out of 59 regions, comprising 95% of the world, electric vehicles and domestic heat pumps generate less carbon dioxide than fossil fuel powered cars or boilers. The only exceptions are heavily coal-dependent countries such as Poland.

In countries such as Sweden, which gets most of its electricity from renewable sources, and France, which is largely powered by nuclear, the CO 2 savings from using electric cars reach as high as 70% over their conventional counterparts.

In the UK, the savings are about 30%. However, that is likely to improve further as electric vehicles grow even more efficient and more CO 2 is taken out of the electricity generating system.

Heat pumps use electricity and heat exchange systems – similar in principle to those found in fridges – to take advantage of the difference in temperature underground and at the surface, in the case of ground source heat pumps, and between the outdoor air and indoors in the case of air source heat pumps. If they were widely used, the study found, they could reduce global carbon emissions by up to 0.8 gigatons a year by 2050, or the equivalent of Germany’s emissions today.

“The idea that electric vehicles or heat pumps could increase emissions is essentially a myth,” said Florian Knobloch of Nijmegen University in the Netherlands, the lead author of the study. “We’ve seen a lot of disinformation going around. Here is a definitive study that can dispel those myths.”

Jean-Francois Mercure, of Exeter University, a co-author of the study, added: “The answer is clear: to reduce carbon emissions, we should choose electric cars and household heat pumps over fossil fuel alternatives.”

Among the detractors has been Bjørn Lomborg, the climate controversialist, who argued in a column published in newspapers around the world last week that electric cars were “simply expensive gadgets heavily subsidised for the wealthy to feel good while doing very little for the planet”.

Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “Electric vehicles and heat pumps are absolutely critical for meeting climate goals so it’s good to see this favourable report. In the UK, both technologies will continue to make big carbon savings alongside our switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy to power the electricity grid.”

But he warned that insulating homes and improving public transport remained important goals, alongside electric vehicles and heat pumps, and called for much more government action to realise the benefits.

“Where the UK is dragging its feet is supporting the necessary rapid rollout of electric cars and heat pumps as well as the infrastructure to support them,” he said."

The East Cape of New Zealand’s North Island is a remote and picture-postcard idyll – boasting a historic lighthouse, wild beaches and mist-cloaked mountains. But as the country prepares to lockdown for four weeks of national self-isolation to fight the spread of Covid-19, indigenous groups in the region say the measures will not go far enough to keep them safe and plan checkpoints on highways into their towns to turn away anyone who doesn’t live or work there.

“Our people are scared,” says Tina Ngata, one of the organisers of the checkpoint to be set up outside the town of Te Araroa; another will spring up outside Ruatoria with more planned further up the coast. “We want to minimise people coming to the region.”

New Zealand has 102 cases of the virus, with no reported deaths. But Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, announced on Monday that she would raise the country’s alert level to four, the highest possible, from Wednesday night in a preemptive effort to prevent thousands from dying.

But Ngata and others worry that people of Ngāti Porou – her Māori iwi, or tribe – will fare much worse than the general population, even with the new restrictions.

After more than a century of colonisation, Māori in New Zealand suffer much worse health outcomes than Pākehā –New Zealanders of European descent – and for Ngāti Porou, the figures are even worse.

“We are far more prone to chronic illnesses like diabetes, renal disease and heart disease, and we have more people with cancer than the rest of the population, we have more people with chronic respiratory illnesses,” Ngata says. “Basically all the illnesses that feature in the chronic Covid-19 descriptors feature really highly in our population.”

The impoverished region, where forestry jobs are suddenly under threat from Covid-19’s spread and unemployment sits at 5.2%, the country’s second-highest rate, also lacks proper healthcare infrastructure.

“We can often go two to three weeks before we will see a doctor come to our region for one day, and usually they’re booked solid for that one day,” she says, adding that even in the nearest city, Gisborne – three hours’ drive away – there are only six intensive care beds, which could easily be filled as the virus spreads.

“It’s about our extreme vulnerability, the fact that we have a worse health profile than the average New Zealand citizen here, and making the people who come here understand that they’re not safe because we don’t have adequate health services,” says Ngata.

From Wednesday, those approaching the towns of Te Araroa and Ruatoria will be waved off the road – organisers say they will not block the road or make physical contact with people or vehicles – when arriving between 8am and 6pm. Travellers will be asked to show identification, including passports for tourists, and register their details at the checkpoints.

Visitors or holidaymakers who refuse to turn back will not be forcibly barred from entering the towns but will likely face short shrift when they do. Those volunteering on the checkpoints will spread the details of the non-compliant visitors throughout the town, and they will not be served at businesses or engaged with by locals.

Other tribes have expressed interest in barring entry to their lands too. Half an hour’s drive north, the iwi Te Whānau ā Apanui said on Saturday that it would operate a round-the-clock checkpoint with travel restrictions for visitors to its lands between Hāwai and Pōtaka; in an unusual step, the council and police published a press release supporting the move.

“No one has set out to establish illegal roadblocks,” said Wally Haumaha, New Zealand’s deputy police commissioner. “This is about community police and iwi taking the lead to ensure rural communities that don’t have immediate access to support services are well protected.”

“This is not a time for egos,” Rawiri Waititi, an iwi leader, said in a Facebook video announcing the checkpoints on Saturday. “The cost of death for our iwi will be catastrophic.”

Other iwi have expressed interest in similar action –Anahera Herbert-Graves from the Far North iwi Ngāti Kahu told Radio New Zealand it was considering closing its tribal borders too.

While plans for the checkpoints were made before Ardern raised the alert level for the country on Monday – meaning that from Wednesday, people are urged to stay at home, only traveling for essential reasons – Ngata said they would still go ahead. Locals are not confident that recently-arrived tourists are complying with directives that they self-isolate for 14 days, she said, and the visitors keep arriving.

“They’re coming for the beaches and the scenery and the laid-back paradise vibe,” she says. “But it’s not as laid-back, it’s very tense in our communities. So it’s not a good time to be visiting.”

The prime minister, Stefan Löfven, on Sunday night called on all Swedes to accept individual responsibility in stopping the rapid spread of the virus as the number of patients in intensive care in Stockholm continued to rise sharply.

“There will be a few decisive moments in life when you must make sacrifices, not only for your own sake but also for those around you, for your fellow humans and for our country,” Löfven said in a rare public address. “That moment is now.”

But while the prime minister said “more invasive decisions” may yet come, he announced no further restrictions. “Everyone must do their part,” he said. “I understand it’s frustrating … But right now it is necessary.”

Sweden, which on Monday reported 2,016 confirmed coronavirus cases and 25 deaths, has shut universities and senior high schools, banned gatherings of more than 500, asked all citizens to avoid non-essential travel and advised those who feel ill and are aged over 70 to stay at home.

Unlike most EU countries, however – including its Nordic neighbours Denmark, Norway and Finland – it has not introduced stricter suppression and social distancing orders such as closing bars, restaurants non-essential shops and lower schools, nor has it placed citizens in near-total lockdown, as in Italy, Spain and France.

I’m an epidemiologist. When I heard about Britain’s ‘herd immunity’ coronavirus plan, I thought it was satire | William Hanage Read more

Sweden’s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, has denied the country’s approach is to rapidly build group immunity to the virus, a tactic seemingly pursued in Britain and the Netherlands until both recently changed tack after warnings that their health systems could be overwhelmed and death tolls would soar.

But Tegnell conceded to the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper last week that such an objective was “not contradictory” with what he described as the government’s core strategy, which was to ensure “a slow spread of infection, and that the health services have a reasonable workload”.

On Sunday night, Tegnell told Swedish TV the outbreak would “calm down” in May but return in the autumn. “It will be important how much of the population is infected,” he said. “It will determine what happens in the autumn.” Coronavirus could be stopped either by “herd immunity, or a combination of immunity and vaccination”, he said. “It’s basically the same thing.”

Swedish health professionals are increasingly expressing concern that the government may be favouring the health of the economy over that of the public. Leading experts last week were fiercely critical of the Swedish public health authority in an email thread seen by state broadcaster SVT, accusing it of incompetence and lack of medical expertise.

“I’m deeply concerned,” Fredrik Elgh, a virology professor at Umeå University, told SVT. “I’d rather Stockholm was quarantined. We are almost the only country in the world not doing everything we can to curb the infection. This is bloody serious.”

Another expert in the thread, Joacim Rocklöv, a professor of epidemiology and public health at Umeå, said: “Does this mean this is a calculated consequence that the government and public health authority think is okay? How many lives are they prepared to sacrifice so as not to … risk greater impact on the economy?”

The Journal of the Swedish Medical Association has published a highly critical paper on the government’s approach, while the daily Dagens Nyheter has printed multiple strongly worded op-eds, including one on Saturday by by Stefan Hanson, an international health PhD, and Claudia Hanson, an epidemiologist.

“We see the situation in Italy,” the authors wrote, “and we are only a few weeks behind … We can’t surrender! The UK, which had the same strategy as Sweden, has now changed completely. It is Stefan Löfven’s duty to do the same in Sweden.’’

Marcus Carlsson, a mathematician at Lund University, has published YouTube videos arguing that there is no evidence of a “herd immunity” approach controlling a virus outbreak anywhere in the world. He described the government’s approach as “a mad experiment with 10 million people”.

Tegnell and Löfven were “playing Russian roulette with the Swedish population,” Carlsson said. “At least if we’re going to do this as a people … lay the facts on the table so that we understand the reasons. The way I am feeling now is that we are being herded like a flock of sheep towards disaster.”

Löfven on Sunday night urged Swedes to get a takeaway lunch from a local restaurant to support local business. Carl Johan Sonesson, a senior local politician in Skåne county, said on Facebook that while protecting older and other at-risk people, Swedes should “consume, eat out, have fun, but responsibly” and “think of all the smaller businesses”."

Russia may be forced to put off a public vote on amendments allowing Vladimir Putin to hold office potentially until 2036 as the coronavirus threatens to upend a busy political season in Russia.

The Kremlin so far has not rescheduled the 22 April vote that was intended as a public endorsement for Putin’s surprise plan to “reset” his term limits, allowing him to run for a fifth or even sixth term as president under a revised constitution.

But as Moscow and other Russian cities introduce stricter preventative measures against the coronavirus, election officials have discussed the possibility of home voting or other ways to pull off a nationwide plebiscite in a country of 140 million when health officials desperately want to reduce face-to-face contact.

“The vote is set for 22 April, but the health of the country’s citizens is most important,” said Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. “If the growth of the epidemiological situation gives cause to reschedule then it will be done.”

On Monday the business daily Vedomosti reported the vote was likely to be rescheduled to June because of fears of the disease spreading in Russia. The decision would probably be announced this week, the newspaper said, citing three sources in the presidential administration. One of the sources said the vote as scheduled could coincide with the projected peak for the number of coronavirus cases in Russia.

The spread of the disease could also threaten Russia’s celebration of the 75th anniversary of Victory Day on 9 May, which the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the US national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, have pledged to attend. The event serves as both a memorial to second world war veterans and as a showcase for Russian military hardware, including aircraft and intercontinental ballistic missile carriers. Russia has already cancelled the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, an important business conference scheduled for June.

Russian officials announced on Monday that they had identified 71 new cases of the disease, bringing the country’s total to 438. Of the known cases, 262 are in Moscow. The country has closed its borders to most foreigners and Moscow’s mayor has announced a new mandatory self-isolation for people over the age of 65 until 16 April, a week before the vote is scheduled to take place.

The coronavirus pandemic has coincided with one of the most consequential political seasons in Russia since 2014, as Putin laid the groundwork this month to potentially becoming the longest-serving ruler since the tsars, outdoing Stalin. Analysts say Putin may not be inclined to serve for another 12 years as president, but needs to leave the option open to avoid becoming a lame duck.

The Moscow-based Centre for Current Policy thinktank said in a note on the effects of coronavirus that a delay of the vote could “negatively affect the perception of government efficiency”.

While the vote is not a referendum and does not have any legal power, it is seen as an endorsement of Putin’s leadership. A delay of the reforms to the constitution, including the amendment on terms limits, could “create the feeling of a dangerous vacuum”, the thinktank wrote.

Public health measures have also had a chilling effect on protests against Putin’s political manoeuvres, with the Moscow government banning public events with more than 50 people present."
https://www.theguardian.com/international,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/24/to-the-maxxx-the-handmaids-tale-star-o-t-fagbenle-on-his-gloriously-daft-new-comedy,2020-03-24T09:00:28,To the Maxxx: The Handmaid's Tale star O-T Fagbenle on his gloriously daft new comedy,"O-T Fagbenle is on his knees in a bloodied toga, singing a cappella and begging Jourdan Dunn for one more chance. The supermodel looks wholly nonplussed, so Fagbenle – playing the eponymous deluded narcissist in the new E4 comedy Maxxx – sweeps out imperiously, only to creep back to tug the trailing toga fabric free from the door.

Comparing Maxxx with Fagbenle’s best-known role in The Handmaid’s Tale, where he plays June’s (Elisabeth Moss) husband Luke Bankole, offers a fine illustration of the actor’s versatility: the gentle, measured Luke, risking his life to try to save his wife and child, could hardly be further from the self-absorbed clown that is Maxxx. But Fagbenle has been quietly doing eye-catching work for years on both sides of the Atlantic, notably in Looking, Andrew Haigh’s underseen HBO drama about gay life in San Francisco, and the BBC’s fine Zadie Smith adaptation NW, as well as lead roles in thrillers including Sky One’s The Five and BBC One’s The Interceptor. You will have seen him in something, just nothing like this.

Once one-third of the fictional boyband Boytown (signature hit: Can I See Your ID?), Maxxx is now a bankrupt, pill-popping joke, getting bottled off at nightclub PAs. His desperation to win back Dunn (gamely playing herself) drives him to plot an unlikely professional comeback. What ensues is a wincingly funny portrait of a man prepared to do anything and everything in order to clamber back up to the stars. It is a mordant, unhinged and probably pretty accurate depiction of life on the margins of celebrity.

“Maxxx is like the dude who took Beyoncé to prom,” says Fagbenle after the scene has wrapped. “His memory of the relationship is a lot sweeter than reality, and reality for Maxxx yesterday involved him shooting a music video and getting covered in dove shit. I didn’t love [filming] that, but you’ve got to go for it.”

You certainly have to when the show is one you are writing, co-directing and headlining. Fagbenle’s brother Luti, whose music videos for Drake, Jay-Z, Beyoncé and more have had more than 4.5bn YouTube views, is exec-producing. Their fraternal dynamic feels, aptly enough, like Bros gone right: respectful, self-aware, rooted in genuine talent. Even months later, when Fagbenle arrives at Channel 4’s HQ looking a legitimate star in tailored check suit, suede shoes and fedora, his relaxed demeanour belies a relentless work rate: “I landed at 2am, was up at eight to record the Maxxx theme tune at my brother Rockwell’s studio … But I have all the problems I’ve asked for.”

Maxxx’s problems are more severe. He cuts a tragic, even sympathetic figure because, Fagbenle feels, his aspirations hit close to home. “We all know people who think ‘likes’ represent genuine popularity. Those ideas of presentation versus reality, of chasing the one thing you think will give you meaning when it does the opposite, fascinate me.”

So should Fagbenle prepare for a backlash from Brosettes, Directioners or the BTS Army? “Hand on heart, it’s not based on any particular pop star,” he laughs. “If anything it’s more my own failings and insecurities, those times where I’ve chased vacuous things or felt depressed because I didn’t feel valued. Ambition can make you do and say crazy stuff. And I’ve got hung up for way too long on a couple of bad break-ups. Basically, I looked at all the ways I’m a fucking idiot and wrote about that.” Fagbenle is no one’s idea of an idiot: engaged, opinionated, casually referencing Walt Whitman, Abraham Maslow and Steven Pinker in his answers. But ambitious? Absolutely.

The fourth of 12 children, O-T (short for Olatunde) had to make himself heard. His siblings include TV producer Luti, music producer Rockwell XL, singer Tito, women’s basketball star and Olympian Temi, and Daps, who has directed videos for artists including Migos and Stormzy … Even those out of the public eye are singers and dancers on the quiet. It must have been a noisy household, I suggest. He shows me a video of his recent birthday gathering: “It is,” he cackles, “a lot.”

Already an accomplished alto saxophonist, the 18-year-old Fagbenle did lighting for a school play and decided that day to audition for drama school. Although few teenagers – and even fewer BAME candidates – were accepted back then, he got into Rada where, sure enough, he was the only black person in his year. It’s a professional experience he has got used to: “Every time I go on set I play Spot The Black Person.” His first acting job saw him asked to “whiten up” in order to accentuate the blackness of his on-stage brother against his own mixed-race ethnicity. The reason given? “Up north they might not be able to tell the difference! My first job,” he says in disbelief. “I was panicking about representing a false idea of the truth to fit with someone’s stereotypical understanding. I’ve had a number of experiences like that.”

The sort of experience that could have derailed a young actor instead hardened his resolve to make it his way. After building a steady career on screen and stage (his performances in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom at the National Theatre and Trevor Nunn’s production of Porgy and Bess were particularly acclaimed), he decided to realise a long-held ambition to direct. A few short films followed, but more substantial material proved harder to come by, so instead he wrote something himself, working on Maxxx’s scripts with improv comedians in Toronto while filming The Handmaid’s Tale.

On the surface, Maxxx and The Handmaid’s Tale don’t have much in common. Maxxx prods at issues but ultimately plays it for laughs, while comedy is in short supply in the dystopian future where the US has been taken over by a totalitarian patriarchy, and fertile women – or “handmaids” – are put into childbearing slavery. But both examine toxic masculinity, albeit from different angles. With Maxxx, which was written just as the #MeToo movement was kicking off, Fagbenle “wanted to see a man out of time, trying to reconcile [his personification of masculinity]” with the expectations of the modern world.

In the era of Trump, The Handmaid’s Tale retains an electrifying currency: the donning of scarlet cloak and bonnet among pro-choice campaigners in the US has been adopted by protesters worldwide, while the show’s setting, Gilead, has become shorthand for any patriarchal regime. “We live in extraordinary times,” says Fagbenle [speaking before the current coronavirus outbreak]. “I’m generally an optimist, although there’s no silver lining to the environmental crisis. But it’s a privilege to be part of something that asks big questions.”

Fagbenle feels that the show has largely addressed accusations of gratuitous violence that circulated after a brutal second season. But its repurposing of slave narratives for the predominantly white women of Gilead, and not entirely convincing presentation of a colourblind world, remains troubling for many. “There’s work to be done,” he admits, “but there’s been a diversification behind the camera which there wasn’t earlier on, with black writers and black directors. If they continue to challenge themselves to do that, they’ll be over the humps.”

Fagbenle also pushed to make Maxxx as diverse as possible on- and off-screen, interviewing widely for cast and crew. “I don’t need to give anyone a leg-up, I just have to make sure they get in the interview room; when you do that, you find talent. If you just say: ‘We should make sure we get some black people in,’ nothing will happen.”

One fascinating exchange on the show sees Maxxx’s strait-laced black manager Tamzin (played by Pippa Bennett Warner) refuting the idea she might be “urban”. “It’s a really interesting question I wrestle with all the time,” says Fagbenle. “Is black a colour, a culture? Can a white person be urban? I wanted Maxxx to be funny but also explore philosophical things. And to have two love interests who are darker-skinned black women; you don’t see that so often.”

It has also allowed Fagbenle to overturn a different sort of expectation, acquired over years in British TV. “I became the professional boyfriend or husband,” he sighs. “Lazy thinking. Different opportunities exist in theatre, but there’s still a dearth of big, expansive characters for minorities and for women on screen. I trained classically for the most exciting texts known to man, and then you get the ‘charming guy in the bar’. Where’s the complexity? I wanted to write a role no one would cast me in: the maniacal egomaniac.”

His next project would have Maxxx drooling: playing agent Rick Mason – an ally from Scarlett Johansson’s character’s past – in Marvel’s Black Widow. “But we flirt, too,” he adds. “The fan scrutiny hasn’t been too crazy, although my poster hasn’t been released yet so we’ll see how that goes.”

My poster hasn’t been released yet? He laughs hysterically. “I’m really not someone who fantasises about being more famous, I’m not like Maxxx! Although maybe we all are to an extent; I hope this speaks to the narcissistic, egomaniacal and unnecessarily long-winded fool in all of us.”

Maxxx starts Thursday 2 April, 9.30pm, E4. All episodes will be available afterwards on All 4"

Were you or I part of the 80s New York nightclub scene, we might have been swept away by the thrill of it all. But even at 17 – her mother had sent her a fake ID – Visage was there to work. “Fun was always involved,” she says. “But I was there to show my wares.” She wanted to get a record deal, and if that didn’t happen, she says, “I’ll be on Broadway. And if I can’t be on Broadway, well, I’ll get a movie. My dreams were ridiculous.” She laughs. “But the beauty of being a child is being able to dream big.”

It paid off – for a while at least. At 19, Visage was in a girl band with a hit single. It only lasted a year, and for the next couple of decades she built a career as a host on US radio. It wasn’t until her 40s (she’s 51), that Visage became the star she had always planned to be, as a judge on the reality show that has become a phenomenon – RuPaul’s Drag Race. In the UK, a stint on Celebrity Big Brother was followed last year by Strictly Come Dancing, the show that brought Visage to an even bigger mainstream audience. When we met, in a hotel suite, she was in London to start filming her own show for BBC Three, Get Off Your Ass, in which her no-nonsense advice is given to people who need a bit of a jolt. She was going to be hosting Drag Race’s Werq the World tour, starring nine of the show’s faces, but the dates have been pushed to later in the year.

Visage is smaller than I imagined, and while dressed down somewhat in glamorous leisurewear, is no less fabulous for it. She can talk and talk, and delivers it all with passion and laughter. There is her hair (styled), her skin (flawless), her nails (deadly), but her noticeably round-as-glitterball breasts – previously a key part of her look – are gone. Visage had her implants removed last yearbecause she believed they were connected to an autoimmune disorder she was diagnosed with in her late 20s, Hashimoto’s disease. She says she feels: “Unbelievable. My health has increased so much in just a year. My thyroid numbers are better, all my blood counts are better.” When she had her breasts done, she came round from the operation and was furious with the surgeon for not making them bigger. “I was so irate,” she says, laughing. “I didn’t want natural. I said: ‘How could you give me natural boobs?’” Does she regret having them? “No, I don’t live my life regretting.”

Visage stretches out like a cat in the sun that streams through the window. She was adopted as a baby and grew up in a loving and close Jewish family in smalltown New Jersey. Her father ran a trophy shop, and her mother was a supply teacher (Visage met her birth mother when she was 25, and they formed a close relationship). At 13, Visage got her first paid role in a play at a local theatre. “I was awkward and chunky, being made fun of, no boys liked me and all my girlfriends had already lost their virginity – yes, at 13, which is crazy but true.” Getting cast in the play made her feel “like I had accomplished something. It was like: I am good enough. Whereas everybody else told me I wasn’t pretty enough, skinny enough, tall enough, cool enough.”

Her parents, she says, knew “fuck all about showbiz”, but they encouraged her to go to New York to attend drama school, and her mother sent her that fake ID, saying: “Go to the clubs, meet people, network!” Visage’s 2015 book, The Diva Rules, is ostensibly a motivational self-help book, but it’s the memoir parts that dazzle. Her description of the New York club scene, particularly the gay ballroom world, where different drag “houses” – each formed of a large group of friends – battled it out against each other in categories such as vogueing or catwalking, are particularly evocative. Visage joined the Magnifiques, a 30-strong house or “family”. “Being allowed in – especially being a cisgender, white, middle-class female – was unheard of. So I felt really special and I still feel really special. It changed my life because this once not-cool girl was in with a whole group of people. When we were hanging out at the Christopher Street piers, just vogueing and having fun, there was never any shade or negativity, it was just a family. That was the most amazing feeling in the world.” It is only recently, she says, that people have questioned her place within the community. “Which is unfair, because I’ve been an ally for 30-plus years. So I do consider myself part of the community. I know how hard the community has struggled to get to where we are today, so now is not the time to start saying you can’t sit with us. We should be inclusive.”

In her New York club days, she slept with women as well as men. Didn’t she identify as bisexual? “No, when I grew up that wasn’t really a thing. If it was, it was gay boys who would come out as bisexual first because it was easier for them. It was just if I saw a pretty girl and I was attracted to her, why not?” Wouldn’t it be easier to answer those who say she doesn’t belong in the LGBT community if she did? “It would be easier, but I don’t feel like the easy way out is always the right way out,” she says. “I don’t want to take anything away from somebody who’s truly living a bisexual lifestyle.”

Visage had moved to New York in 1986, as the city was in the grip of the Aids crisis. “So many of the people that I’d known through the ballroom scene are gone. To see that many people go, and to see relatives not come to their funerals because of the shame, it just wasn’t necessary. It was so tragic.” There were also a lot of drugs, she says. “I lost a lot of friends in that community to drugs, or to being sex workers who were killed by tricks. Just dangerous living. These kids needed to be taken care of.” Visage wasn’t into drugs, and while she did drink, briefly, she soon stopped. “I realised really early on that this this wasn’t the way for me. I had no boundaries at all – I would do whatever, wherever, with whomever. I took every risk possible.”

Instead, she focused on her goal – to become the next Madonna. “She was and still is my ultimate diva,” says Visage. (Incidentally, Visage’s story goes that Madonna saw her vogueing at the nightclub impresario Susanne Bartsch’s legendary Love Ball; soon afterwards, Madonna’s Vogue video came out. When, on her Blonde Ambition tour, the popstar dressed suspiciously like Visage in knee pads and high blonde ponytail, “I was like: ‘What the fuck?’ Now, did she steal that from me?” says Visage. “I don’t know, but she definitely ran in the same circle that I ran, with the same people.”)

When she was 19, Visage joined the girl group Seduction. The group was a hit, but lasted only a year and Visage left with no money. “I will say that it was a great experience. We had a platinum record, we got to tour with Milli Vanilli, playing arenas. It was the most incredible time of my life, and I would do it again. But we weren’t being paid the way we should have been paid – at 19 you don’t care.”

She took a job in a strip club, not taking her clothes off, but hosting the club’s hot-oil wrestling show – in which the female wrestlers and whatever man paid to be in the ring with them were covered in oil – “and I got to use my wit on the microphone every night. I learned a lot about not being taken advantage of, and I also realised I don’t give a shit. Meaning: ‘Yeah, I was in a pop group, and yeah, it failed. So I’m working in the strip club. You want a seat?’ Once you stop caring about what people think about you, you’ll be free.”

Visage has been her family’s breadwinner – her husband, David, was a writer and actor, but decided to stay at home and raise their two daughters. It has been tough being away so much, especially since both girls have had mental health problems. “They have a very close relationship with their dad, which is wonderful because a lot of times dads are at work and kids don’t get that connection. My daughters are lucky to have a dad who has given his life for them. They have good days and bad, mostly good these days. But when they were younger and really going through it, it was tough. And I tried to stay there as much as I could, but at the end of the day, money’s running out, rent has to be paid, so I have to take the jobs.”

Drag Race changed her life, but it has also had a wider cultural impact (it has won multiple Emmys; the New York Times called it “the most radical show on TV”). “What I see is a lot more acceptance, a lot more tolerance,” she says. “I have a gay daughter, so the most rewarding thing is to see a parent stand by their queer child, whereas maybe even five years ago, they wouldn’t have understood.” Gay children are “being heard, being validated as human beings. I try to tell parents who are struggling that they don’t have to approve, they just need to accept. So how it’s changed mainstream is that. It still is made by gays, for gay people, but it’s now for everybody to find their colour in the rainbow and realise that they’re not alone.”

Would she have women, known as bio queens, competing on the show? In 2018, in an interview with this paper, RuPaul said he wouldn’t allow women, including post-transition trans women, to compete (several queens have come out as transgender after appearing on the show). “I mean, I am one, so technically we are on the show,” says Visage. “I would love it. I would actually love to host my own version – with bio queens and trans women.” She says there’s no rule that they’re not allowed on. “Everybody’s welcome to audition – we just don’t get a lot of bio queens.” Visage says she understands “that the transition is greater from a rugged male to a drag queen, versus a female to a drag queen. But that doesn’t exclude the art of bio-queendom.” She gets up from her chair. “I’m going to yank my drawers down.” She pulls down her trousers to show a tattoo reading “drag queen” at the top of her thigh. “Because that’s who I am and that’s what I identify as.”

What makes Visage – she of the exaggerated lipliner, blow-out hair, sparkly talons and certainly the charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent necessary for Drag Race winners – consider herself a drag queen? “Ru said it best – that you’re born naked and the rest is drag. It’s true. We become somebody else when we get done. This is my shield, my superhero costume. When I put on my makeup, my drag, I feel like I can take on the world.”

Peter Swanson

Faber, £12.99, pp288

Malcolm Kershaw runs a bookstore in Boston specialising in mystery fiction. He is contacted by an FBI agent, Gwen Mulvey, who believes someone has been using the blog he wrote years earlier – in which Kershaw picks eight “perfect” murders in fiction – to knock off a host of real victims. Their deaths appear to be linked with the likes of Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders, Patricia Highsmith’s Strangers on a Train and James M Cain’s Double Indemnity. What does Kershaw know?

This is a fiendishly good slice of crime fiction from Swanson, who goes from strength to strength. Layered and clever, Rules for Perfect Murders is an ode to the genre of mystery writing, with its obsessive protagonist Kershaw, a man who wonders what Ian Fleming would have his hero do in times of crisis – and who bemoans the fact that being an avid reader of mysteries is no preparation for real life.

The Familiar Dark

Amy Engel

Hodder & Stoughton, £14.99, 256pp

Eve has been anticipating disaster from the second her daughter Junie was born. Twelve years later, as The Familiar Dark opens, it arrives, as Junie and her best friend Izzy are murdered in the local park.

“When my daughter was born, I had anticipated a million ways my clawing, desperate love for her could go sideways… but her throat slit in the park where she’d played as a little girl? No, that was never a horror story I had entertained,” says Eve, who grew up in the poorest part of the Missouri Ozarks, and who now digs deep into the past she vowed to leave behind as she sets out to get justice for Junie.

“I thought about all the press conferences I’d seen over the years, parents trotted out for missing kids, killed kids, abused kids,” she says. “We can be sad, distraught, confused, pleading, forgiving. But not furious. Fury is reserved for other people. The worst thing you can be is an angry woman, an angry mother.” But Eve is angry, and now she has nothing left to lose.

The second adult novel from the author of The Roanoke Girls, this is uncompromising, fierce and brilliant.

The Second Wife

Rebecca Fleet

Doubleday, £16.99, pp336

In Rebecca Fleet’s The Second Wife, Alex is walking home along the seafront one evening when he smells smoke and realises his house is on fire. His wife, Natalie, has escaped, but his daughter, Jade, is still inside. She is rescued by a firefighter, but when she wakes, she tells her father that she was hiding when the fire began, because there was a man in their house.

Her words prompt Alex, already furious with his new wife for leaving Jade behind, to start asking questions, and as the narrative flicks back and forth between Alex and Natalie, and between past and present, it starts to become clear that there’s a lot she hasn’t told him about her past. “Later, when he was asleep, I lay there and wondered if anything I had told him was actually true.”

Well handled and enjoyably twisty, this is most impressive for its chilling insights into obsession and where it can lead.

Black River

Will Dean

Point Blank, £14.99, pp384

Will Dean’s series about deaf Swedish reporter Tuva Moodyson is a must read – and this book is his best yet.

Tuva has been off the booze and living in the south when she learns that her best friend, Tammy Yamnim, has gone missing from Gavrik. She rushes back north to find her, only to discover that no one is taking Tammy’s disappearance seriously, and that someone appears to be actively sabotaging her search.

Set during the endless light of Sweden’s Midsommar, in “a one-horse town surrounded by a one-thousand moose forest”, Black River is eerie, unnerving and buckets of fun. “Too much wilderness this far north. Too much space. Too many hiding places,” thinks Tuva. Indeed.

https://www.theguardian.com/international,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/24/no-modernism-without-lesbians-diana-souhami-review,2020-03-24T07:00:26,No Modernism Without Lesbians by Diana Souhami – review,"As Diana Souhami sees it, lesbianism is much more than a sexual preference: it extends into an artistic vocation, an enraptured emotional cult and a political campaign that challenges the bullyboy patriarchs who assumed that “women’s bodies belong to men” and should be consecrated to perpetuating the male line. Souhami has written several fine biographies of what Truman Capote once reprehensibly called the “daisy-chain” of “butch-babes”; now, in a comprehensive cultural history, she awards lesbians the credit for modernising art, manners and morals in the early 20th century.

Like a tabloid headline, her book’s title is intended to provoke, and it depends on a somewhat tenuous analogy: “modernism in art upended 19th-century rules of narrative and form”, so why shouldn’t modernity in life revise the “codes of conduct for sexual exchange”, licensing women to defy men or dispense with them and love each other instead? To paraphrase her slogan a little more modestly, what Souhami shows is that there might have been no modernism if the lesbian bookseller Sylvia Beach had not arranged to publish James Joyce’s Ulysses in Paris when editors in London and New York, fearing prosecution for obscenity, refused to touch it.

Beach, who founded the Left Bank bookshop Shakespeare and Company, behaved towards Joyce with a wifely devotion that was lacking in his actual spouse, the rebarbative Nora Barnacle. She happily performed the endless editorial chores he set her, and glorified the labour as her “missionary endeavour’. The moment that wealthier backers became available, Joyce of course forgot about her service to him. The ancient female function of helpmeet was hard to shed. Beach’s shop, installed in a former laundry, was a domestic space, furnished with comfortable chairs and vases of flowers; brewing tea or lending books to customers who could not afford to buy them, she officiated as a mother hen.

Souhami rails at the “old-style masculine domination” that results in war, mass murder and sexual repression

Another of Souhami’s characters dispensed patronage on a grander scale. Bryher – born Annie Winifred Glover, though she reinvented herself by borrowing a new name from one of the Scilly Isles – was the munificent daughter of a shipping magnate. She bankrolled the artistic whims of everyone she knew, paid Freud a small fortune to psychoanalyse her lover Hilda Doolittle, and presented Edith Sitwell with a house. In her saintlier or dottier moments, she played Lady Bountiful to strangers in the street: she bought new dentures for a woman she found toothlessly chomping in a bread queue, and replaced the ill-fitting wellington boots of a woebegone fireman.

Throughout her book, Souhami rails at the “old-style masculine domination” that results in war, mass murder and sexual repression. As the jack-booted invaders march into Paris in 1940, trampling what was once “the sapphic centre of the western world”, she calls patriarchy “militaristic, fascistic”. Yet power is not an exclusively male preserve, and it lurks in the relationships between women examined here. The painter and poet Natalie Barney appears as a reckless predator who breaks a sofa when pouncing on a supine seducee; the Princesse de Polignac – another heiress, born Winnaretta Singer, whose liberation was bankrolled by her family’s output of sewing machines – brings the skittish Violet Trefusis to heel with a whip.

Gertrude Stein and Alice B Toklas act out a paradoxical variant of this power play. Stein was cubistically solid, gruff and glowering, while Toklas, even with her bristly moustache, looked meek and dainty. Alice kept house, cooked, and allowed Gertrude to be a full-time genius, which was hard work because “you have to sit around so much doing nothing”. Yet the apparent weakling in this menage turned out to be the slave-driver, as Ernest Hemingway testified when he overheard Stein beg for mercy as she was tongue-lashed by the partner she called “Pussy”.

Stein made up for such grovelling when she announced her artistic status by declaring that “20th-century literature is Gertrude Stein”. Her self-puffery now sounds absurd, and Souhami’s view of her as “the mother and father of modernism” is not much more persuasive. At best, Stein was the fairy godmother of modernism. Like Beach and Barney, she kept a salon where she performed the traditional role of hostess, supervising the camaraderie of the male painters, writers and musicians who attended; armed with the inevitable private income, derived in her case from San Francisco streetcars, she amassed an uninsurably valuable collection of paintings by Cézanne, Picasso and Matisse, which she left unframed and sometimes casually stashed in closets.

Daunted by Stein’s droning epic The Making of Americans, Souhami has better luck with the avian burbling of her libretto for Virgil Thomson’s all-black opera Four Saints in Three Acts. Here Stein’s verbal tics are subsumed into music, and Souhami writes about the witty, frothy piece with verve. Then, getting overzealous, she claims that Four Saints was more epochal and innovative than Ulysses, if only because Joyce’s novel was still fuddy-duddily “bound within the covers of a book”.

Souhami ends with some blithe mimicry of Stein’s echolalia, rejoicing in a Parisian paradise where “lovers of love and refreshment in life still loved, and loved lovers and loved love”. I abbreviate a long alliterating paragraph of hallelujahs: here is Capote’s daisy chain made of words, though the repetitions hardly erase memories of the miserable childhoods and agonising affairs Souhami has chronicled. Love is lovely and even heavenly, but sex, regardless of gender, can be diabolical.

Last Tuesday, Jessica Altchiler led a ballet class. But instead of the long, sleek barre she would normally rely on for support, she grasped on to a TV stand. And if that alone didn’t prove she wasn’t at a conventional dance studio, the red-and-black plaid pet bed in the background gave her away.

Still, she tendued, relevéd and coached other dancers, even though she couldn’t see them.

“I’m already sweating!” she said as she ducked into the camera frame. “I hope other people are sweating, too.”

Not even a week before she was teaching on Instagram Live, Altchiler had been in Detroit as part of her first professional job in the national tour of Fiddler on the Roof. While she and her fellow cast members performed in the show, they saw headlines about Broadway shutting down and March Madness being cancelled. Then, their own tour dates were postponed, and a suddenly unemployed Altchiler boarded a nearly empty flight back to her family home in Connecticut.

“It’s strange for me to think about people still having a job because, for me, the world was just turned upside down,” she said.

All of the savings that she and her co-workers had been carefully growing to move to New York, pay for an apartment or invest in classes now have to be redirected toward survival during this unprecedented time in theater history, and some of her colleagues are scrambling to find a place to stay after months on the road.

As the world wrestles with Covid-19, Altchiler’s new reality isn’t particularly uncommon among artists. Theater professionals are frightened, and they’re mourning a lot of art that may never again see the light of day as venues shutter at least temporarily and would-be audiences disappear. But even as performers suffer great personal and professional losses, they’re working overtime to send messages of hope and peace, provide necessary resources to others who are struggling and offer a balm for the social-distanced and self-isolated.

On an at-home edition of The Tonight Show last Wednesday, Lin-Manuel Miranda joined Jimmy Fallon to raise money for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights Aids’ Covid-19 emergency assistance fund. The Hamilton star performed his song about parents wanting to give the best possible version of the world to their children, as parents everywhere, including Fallon and Miranda, stare down a global crisis alongside their own kids.

Also online, the theater legend and radio host Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley, his producer husband, quickly organized twice-daily at-home performances to fundraise for the Actors Fund. A long list of Broadway A-listers immediately signed up. Kristin Chenoweth was all dressed up when she appeared on the web series from her bathroom over the weekend, and on Saturday, Lea Salonga will call in to sing at 2am Manila time.

“Artists love the world, and they love helping,” Rudetsky said. “So every single person we wrote basically just wrote back right away and said: ‘I’m in, I’m in, what do I do?’”

Meanwhile, theaters are trying to figure out how to stay afloat and take care of their own as the very notion of live entertainment has become taboo. Susi Damilano, co-founder and producing director of the San Francisco Playhouse, said she hasn’t had to fire anyone, and she’s asking hourly workers to submit their schedules on a week-to-week basis for compensation. She’s hoping patrons will donate the value of a ticket and landlords will ease up on rent; if not, her playhouse will only be able to pay people for a few months.

“I think that the arts and culture are proving to be where we all turn in times of difficulty, and yet are the first and hardest hit economically,” said Damilano. “And people are realizing that.”

As theaters take a financial clobbering, some are requesting that playwrights refund advance payments. Lynn Nottage – one of America’s foremost playwrights who has earned two Pulitzer prizes for her work – was asked by a large regional theater to return her advance, even as everything she had scheduled was cancelled before her eyes and she lost what would have probably been the majority of her income for the year.

Nottage said most companies aren’t making such requests, but she did worry about what’s going to happen as theaters – another place where people go to heal – close down for the time being. She empathized with the young artists who had debuts in Seattle, New York and Chicago, the up-and-coming actors, playwrights and directors who usually present work during this time of year and even the singers who were performing in her first opera at Lincoln Center.

On Broadway, young performers who were ready for their big breaks got caught in limbo, some even before their first performances. Michael Lepore, who is making his Broadway debut alongside 12 others in Sing Street, had just walked on the Lyceum Theatre stage for the first time when all of Broadway closed at least until April.

“It was all these dreams come true, with this thing hanging in the air of like, ‘Oh God, this is going to be it for a little bit,’” he said.

With everything delayed, he retreated to his parents’ home in Connecticut with all his instruments – as a cover, he’s required to know the show on acoustic and electric guitar, bass, piano, synthesizer, baritone electric guitar and stylophone. He’s been getting his notes in order and making sure he’s off-book. But he’s also started working on his own music, and he’s recording a few things.

People are adapting, Rudetsky said. Quoting the musical Closer Than Ever, he started to sing: “‘If someone told me even just a week ago … I would have said you’re crazy, I’d have burst right into tears, but here I am.’

“Yes, the things we plan on happening are not gonna happen,” he said. “But, who knows what will happen?”"

In 1973, Soviet Central Television aired a new drama series called Seventeen Moments of Spring, about a Russian secret agent posing as a high-ranking Nazi official called Stierlitz. Stierlitz, James Bond’s Soviet equivalent, was a deliberate propaganda creation – the book on which the series was based was commissioned by the then head of the KGB, Yuri Andropov. In one concrete sense, the effort was successful: it made 20-year-old Vladimir Putin want to become a spy.

The three-part documentary series Putin: A Russian Spy Story (Channel 4) portrays the Russian leader – who, if you include his contrived second stint as prime minister, has outlasted three US presidents and looks well positioned to see off a few more – through the prism of his past. It features interviews with those who have worked with him, those who have known him well and those who have run up against him. Some, including Boris Yeltsin’s daughter Tatyana Yumasheva, are speaking on UK television for the first time.

The first testimonial about Putin’s character comes from the opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza, who has had the misfortune of being poisoned by people he is certain are connected to Putin and his state security apparatus not once, but twice, nearly dying both times. “I have no doubt absolutely that this was done as retribution for my political activities in the Russian opposition,” he says. Kara-Murza sees Putin as a product of his background, specifically of his KGB training: “He’s doing what he was taught to do – manipulate, lie, recruit, repress. He seems to be quite good at his job.”

This first instalment takes us only as far as Putin’s election to the presidency in March 2000, but his early days have plenty of insight to offer. Born in St Petersburg in 1952, Putin was, in the words of the author Alex Goldfarb, “a schoolyard thug” who escaped prison only because of his talent for judo; in those days, the KGB kept an eye out for anyone proficient in martial arts. In 1975, two years after Stierlitz first caught his imagination, Putin joined up.

His first posting, to dreary, mid-80s Dresden, came with none of the glamour he had hoped for. To make matters worse, the Berlin wall came down a few years later, taking Putin’s career prospects with it. By the time he returned home, the Soviet Union was on the brink of collapse.

Putin resurfaced in the 90s as a fixer for St Petersburg’s democratically elected and prodigiously corrupt mayor, Anatoly Sobchak. One person who encountered him in those days describes him as “a very dry, obviously very humourless man of small stature”.

Putin mostly kept himself in the shadows, but a 1992 documentary about the city’s administration features him driving around town accompanied by the soundtrack from Seventeen Moments of Spring. There is also a scene in which the interviewer asks Putin if he takes bribes. Putin answers evasively, but with enough menace that the interviewer apologises for asking.

Sobchak found graft and popularity hard to combine. When he lost his bid for re-election in 1996, Putin learned a valuable lesson: never to trust the outcome of an important election to voters. Starting his career over for a second time, Putin packed up his bag of tricks and moved to Moscow.

He rose quickly through the ranks to head the FSB, the main successor of the KGB. At the time, Boris Yeltsin could barely walk in a straight line, let alone run the country, and Russia was in search of a leader who could bring stability. Nobody thought it was Putin. “That was just simply impossible to sort of grasp,” says Mikhail Fishman, the former editor of Russian Newsweek, “because we just didn’t know his face.”

Yeltsin, however, had benefited from Putin’s skilled use of kompromat: the president’s enemies were entrapped and exposed. Yeltsin made Putin his prime minister and his successor. There was the small matter of getting a charmless nobody elected, but, in a country crying out for order, Putin’s KGB history was not considered a drawback.

The most chilling voice to grace this documentary is Putin’s own: prosaic, earnest, flatly recounting his story in his peculiar, dull-but-still-untrustworthy manner. At the end, though, its menace was in its absence. On the night of the March 2000 election victory, a camera crew sat with Yeltsin as he called Putin to congratulate him. But Putin was busy; he would have to call back. The crew waited with Yeltsin, but the call did not come. An hour and a half later, it still had not come. According to those present, it never did."

There are many memorable “firsts” in my life. The first time I freewheeled a bike down a hill, and understood what the exhilaration of flying must feel like. The first time I found myself gibbering: “Ohmygodohmygod” after putting a blue cheese toastie into my mouth. Or when I tried breaking into my own house after forgetting my keys and my mum called the police on me.

Hey, they all make for good stories.

But my favourite first? The one that will make me cherish the sheer beauty of life until my dying day? Which, at the time made my head spin like the universe had just spent 50p on a fairground carousel? And which did so while feeling like an extremely bizarre romcom? The first time that I met the woman who would be my wife.

The year is 2012, the location: my living room. Luscious mullets flutter in the breeze, dramatic smoke envelops shellsuit-clad forms and the air is thick with Chesney Hawkes. It’s a party atmosphere: people dance, others sing, wine flows like wine. And I stand in the midst of it, awestruck. Because as bouffant lycra wearers mill around me, I am locking eyes with Adam Ant. And Adam Ant is the most beautiful woman I have ever met.

See what I mean? That, right there, is the opening scene to a romantic comedy straight out of the minds of the creators of Stranger Things. When me and my future wife met, we did so at a 1980s house party I was throwing – she was in fancy dress as a dandy highwayman, I was clad from head to toe in a highly synthetic (and highly flammable) tracksuit. I’d been hoping to look like Public Enemy’s Flavour Flav. But in reality, I looked more like a member of ex-noughties Welsh rappers Goldie Lookin’ Chain. Or one of Harry Enfield’s scousers. When I met the love of my life, I was a walking fire hazard in sweatbands.

At this point, my confidence with women was not high. The preceding years hadn’t been a good time for my love life. In fact, only an extreme optimist would even use the term “love life” of the disastrous string of blind dates, month-long relationships and fruitless subscriptions to dating sites with which I frittered away most of the decade. I had pretty much given up even talking to people I found attractive by this stage. If I’d seen someone this beautiful in a bar, I wouldn’t have even bothered. But this: this was different. It was my living room. Everyone knows that you can’t be crushingly rejected in the same room as your lovely, comfy sofa. So, in what was an extremely rare act for me, I wandered over and said the most spellbindingly bewitching and romantic words ever to emerge from the mouth of this silver-tongued Casanova.

“Hi. Nice costume.”

You see why I was single.

Fortunately, she was flattered by the compliment – coming as it did, from someone whose dedication to fancy dress made them look like they’d just tried out for Accrington Stanley’s 1980s Milk Cup squad. And, to my utter giddy joy, we hit it off instantly. We spent most of the night together: talking, dancing, sampling 1980s drinks such as Babycham and wishing we hadn’t sampled 1980s drinks such as Babycham. As the evening drew to an end, we found ourselves snuggled up on a sofa, sharing a moment during which it was pretty clear that a romance was blossoming. I looked down at her, she looked up at me and our eyes locked in a long, lingering moment that could only end in our first kiss.

Until one of my flatmates burst in and shouted: “Quick! You’ve got to go into the lounge!” Apparently, there was an urgent “situation” that needed taking care of. A really, really bad one. Something that was about to destroy our entire party. A situation that he described as: “A sex vibe”.

Not only did this sound like utter nonsense: it was (I blame the Babycham). But after leaving the room to discover a total lack of “sex vibe”, I ended up finding something way worse. On my return to my spot on the sofa, the beautiful highwayman had disappeared. I would later find out that the “sex vibe” nonsense was so strange she assumed it was a bizarre attempt to rescue me from an unwanted romantic entanglement. She’d thought she was being given the cold shoulder and had left. And when I saw that she wasn’t there any more? I thought it was me who was being spurned. That night, I slept alone in a shellsuit.

And then, exactly one year later, we bumped into each other in a bar. Now with no flatmate to separate us, we quickly cleared up what had happened. Our strange initial meeting became a shared joke, and though neither of us said it, I think the fact that we’d assumed we’d never speak again somehow made this chance encounter feel weirdly romantic. By the end of the night, we’d arranged our first date.

Well, I say “we”. She got bored of waiting for me to pluck up the courage, so she asked me out. Still, we got there in the end.

But if it weren’t for the bizarre circumstances of our first meeting, we never would have. I’d most likely have never said hello to someone I fancied if I hadn’t been buoyed by the confidence of being in my own flat. It wouldn’t have felt so special if we hadn’t resigned ourselves to never meeting again. And I wouldn’t have realised how much more I fancied her when she wasn’t dressed as a facepaint-wearing male pop star. As I said, it’s the story of your classic Hollywood romcom: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy goes to sleep alone in shellsuit before girl gets him back.

It’s a story that we cherish as being uniquely our own. It’s one we love to tell people. In fact, we love it so much that only 12 months ago, I told it at our wedding. That “first” changed my life for the better forever – and there are not many things you can say that about.

https://www.theguardian.com/international,https://www.theguardian.com/the-power-of-firsts/2020/feb/12/seven-facts-that-will-convince-you-to-make-the-switch-to-an-electric-car,2020-02-12T13:07:17,Seven facts that will convince you to make the switch to an electric car,"EVs such as the New Renault ZOE that cost less than £40,000 new are exempt from road tax. Model shown is GT Line from £28,620 MRRP

Making the leap from an internal combustion engine (ICE) car to a fully electric vehicle (EV) can feel daunting. Charging, running costs and range are all common areas of concern – but they shouldn’t be.

EV technology has come on in leaps and bounds in recent years, meaning electric cars can rival their petrol and diesel competitors at every turn.

Want to know more? Then here are seven facts to help you decide whether it’s time to switch ...

1) You can rapidly charge in just 30 minutes

With its 52kWh battery, the New Renault ZOE will get 90 miles of range from a 30-minute charge with a rapid charger(1) – which can be found at service stations, on the side of the road and in car parks. However, with a range of up to 245 miles(2), you are unlikely to need to charge anywhere apart from at home – especially as Renault offers a free home wall box(3) with eligible purchases making home charging a breeze.

2) Charging costs less than filling up with fuel

In general, an EV will work out at about 2-3p per mile(6) based on the price of electricity, which is a more affordable “fuel” than petrol or diesel – it’s as simple as that. The most cost-effective way to charge your EV is at home overnight when you’ll get the lowest rate, which could be as little as 8p per kilowatt-hour(6).

3) There are now more public EV charging locations than petrol stations in the UK

The UK’s charging network is growing and evolving every day – so you’ll never be far from finding a top up should you need it. In fact, according to Zap-Map (a leading charging point platform), there are more than 10,000 locations throughout the country where you can charge an EV. Considering there are fewer than 8,500 petrol stations in the UK, it’s an eye opening statistic.

4) Electric car batteries are more powerful than ever

Battery technology has come a long way in the last five years, and is only going to continue to improve. A great example of this is the New Renault ZOE. The first Renault ZOE had a range of 90 miles(4), while just seven years later, the New ZOE can do up to 245 miles(2) on a single charge.

Battery life is another common concern but, according to Renault ZOE product manager Emily Rice, all signs are positive on that front too. “Renault EVs and their batteries are designed to last the test of time, with a whole host of technology built into them to ensure the batteries last, such as a thermal management system, to stop the battery overheating and an automatic cut off once the battery has reached 100% to avoid ‘over charging’. All of this put together with an eight-year battery warranty(5) ensures maximum peace of mind for our customers.”

This means that you can see your EV as a long-term investment, rather than a short-term purchase.

5) An electric car will help you do your bit for the environment

On the road, electric vehicles have zero emissions – they don’t even have exhaust pipes – which means that unlike petrol or diesel vehicles, they don’t negatively affect air quality. If you choose an energy supplier which provides energy from 100% renewable sources, when you charge your EV at home you’ll also be doing your bit to help the UK meet its commitment to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.

6) You don’t have to pay additional charges or taxes

Another great financial bonus, vehicles with ultra-low emissions are exempt from congestion and ultra-low-emission-zone charges around the UK. While driving, the New Renault ZOE emits 0 gCO2/km, making those city-centre payments a thing of the past.

In addition, from April 2020, fully electric cars like the New Renault ZOE will pay no company car tax, which could save you thousands of pounds a year depending on your tax bracket. On top of this, you’ll benefit from free road tax if your EV – like the New Renault ZOE, which starts at £25,670 MRRP – costs less than £40,000 new. A nice little bonus.

7) Electric cars can rival ICE cars when it comes to performance

If you’re assuming that EVs are slow and dull to drive, you couldn’t be more wrong. In fact, they’re known for being smooth and nippy. “This is due to an electric car having ‘instant torque’,” Rice says. “In an ICE vehicle, you have to rev the engine to reach maximum torque and this can take a few moments, but in an electric car, maximum torque is provided from the moment you hit the pedal so, therefore, you can accelerate faster.”

What’s more, although EVs are often heavier than their ICE equivalents due to their batteries, that weight is usually distributed along the floor of the vehicle; this means many EVs have a low centre of gravity, which improves handling.

I own, conservatively, 5 trillion instructional books on parenting.

Some of these books offer ways to “hack” your child’s bedtime – by shushing them aggressively until they are terrorised into sleep, for instance, or hypnotising them into slumber by intoning bedtime stories in a slightly creepy whale-song soprano.

Others measure childhood in a series of “developmental milestones”, like “first roll on to his back”, or “first time following a light with her eyes”. “First time laughing at a TV show” isn’t on any of the lists (I mean, I assume it isn’t; what parent has time to read an actual book?), but it should be, because, when I was a new mum, that’s where it all started to come together.

Since (his admittedly tricky) birth, my first son, Herbie, has been a terrible sleeper – only falling asleep if physically attached to a warm parental body; waking several times during the night, apparently furious that his father and I had tricked him into this sleeping business; and rising obscenely early the next day.

On this particular January morning, the moon still sailed high in the black sky, and the central heating was hours away from clicking on. I wrapped my wide-awake baby against me in my fleecy dressing gown, plonked us both in front of the TV, and tried to unglue my eyelashes.

New parenthood can be a grind, especially if your baby is a bad sleeper; like my son. Of course, I loved my baby beyond all measure. I loved his sapphire-blue eyes, and his single flaxen cowlick, high thigh-dimples, his inexplicably French accent. However, by the time he was six months old, I was averaging less than four hours’ sleep a night – and attempting to return to the workforce – so essentially I was a burnt-out husk of a woman.

But on this morning, as we sat there gently babbling at a toy giraffe (my son), and huddling over a mug of coffee for warmth (me), suddenly it happened. Suddenly, I heard it: the tiniest, tinkliest little laugh.

On TV, a brightly coloured clown was pratfalling and cartwheeling. My son was transfixed, his jaw slack, a smile tickling the corners of his mouth. Very briefly, he shot me a wondrous, are-you-seeing-what-I’m-seeing glance, and pointed at the television. “Ha,” he offered by way of explanation. Then the clown fell over and honked his nose, and my son erupted in a stream of giggles that came bubbling up out of him.

It was the best noise I’d ever heard.

My son had laughed before, of course, although he wasn’t initially an easy audience. For some months he refused to laugh, regarding his father’s and my silly faces and stuck-out tongues with all the impassive judgment of Joaquin Phoenix’s stone-faced Roman emperor in Gladiator.

Finally, we cracked it by blowing raspberries on his belly, and flying him through the air like Superman. But those were reflexive, sensory giggles and laughs of exhilaration.

This laugh was something new; not a tickle or an exciting new sensation, but a glimpse of the person he was becoming, and the personality that was growing beneath all those dimples. And in just a couple of seconds, I felt entirely differently about motherhood.

Sometimes the very early days of parenthood can feel like a really intense Tamagotchi challenge: someone has given you this little lump of life, and you must feed it, and care for it, and keep it alive at all times during the day – even when you are in the toilet.

But, after this day my husband and I recorded every instance of this cartwheeling clown we could find. And, as he continued to offer us daily shards of his personality – creating complex emotional dioramas using forks; a preference for elephants and the colour red – for a while we went a bit mad, showering him in forks and red elephants just to make him laugh.

As a new parent, you can easily lose yourself to the minutiae of nappy changes, bottle-warmings, and breastfeeds; freaking out when it’s time to cut their delicate – but somehow razor-sharp – nails; wondering if anyone would notice if you popped to the shop in your pyjamas. You might forget that all this effort is in support of – not a Tamagotchi, or even a new pet you feel very strongly about – but an actual, bona fide person.

Albeit one who’s really into clowns.

My son’s first laugh was almost four years ago now. Today, he’s in his first year of primary school, and has a younger brother (who also loves laughing, and elephants). My older son’s passion for clowns has been replaced by a slightly frightening obsession with the Incredible Hulk (the other day, he hulked out in public, and roared so loudly he scared an innocent bystander), but he’s still recognisable as the little boy who was so tickled by the funny, falling-over man. He is sweet and funny and imaginative, with a wonderfully developed sense of the absurd.

And I can’t wait to see who he’ll become next.

Photograph: Melanie Kintz/Stocksy United

At the back of many motorists’ minds, there’s a nagging question: should my next car be electric? Increasing numbers of them are deciding – yes, it should. Electric vehicle (EV) sales are accelerating rapidly, with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) figures for September 2019 showing a 236.4% rise year-on-year.

There’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.

‘Are electric cars cheaper to maintain?’ – and four other common EV questions answered Read more

“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”

When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”

According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest If you need to charge up when out and about, the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations

And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).

And with cheap running costs, electric cars can be good for your bank balance as well as your conscience. The initial cost of an electric car tends to be higher than that of a petrol or diesel equivalent – though the government currently offers a grant of up to £3,500 towards brand new 100% electric vehicles.

But it’s in the daily running costs where electric vehicles really excel. Fully electric vehicles with a list price of under £40,000 are exempt from vehicle excise duty (AKA road tax) as well as London’s congestion charge and its ultra low emission zone (ULEZ) charge. EVs don’t need oil changes and have fewer moving parts, so you could save 20-30% on servicing and maintenance costs compared with a petrol or diesel car.

Do you have a pressing question about electric cars? Submit it above for your chance to have your question answered by an EV expert...

And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.

But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”

“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”

It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?

This demand for an unpaid fine can go straight in the bin

I have just received a £188 demand from a firm of debt collectors for a parking offence that allegedly took place in Italy back in 2017. I had hired a car but had not visited the town in question, Pompei.

A year after the trip, I received a notification from the Italian authorities demanding the fine be paid. This saga rumbled on until Hertz customer services sent me an email saying it had all been dropped and my administration fee had been refunded.

I was therefore somewhat surprised to receive a letter last month from CLI, a UK-based debt collection company, demanding £188 in relation to this unpaid parking fine. Repeated attempts to sort this out via email and phone have not resulted in any response from Hertz, and I am turning to you to see if you can help me get this matter finally put to bed.

Martin, London

Status update on me: I am spending every day, all day, inside my home with three children under five and a deranged, underwalked terrier who barks incessantly at his own reflection in the window. Am I lucky? You bet: I have a home and, so far, everyone has their health. But does my life also resemble a Channel 5 reality TV show? Maybe just a touch.

It is perhaps because of this that I spent most of the weekend wanting to shout at people. Not at the children or the dog because that would only add to the noise, and if we go up by just one decibel I honestly think we would break international law. No, I wanted to shout at the people I could see casually strolling outside as if it were just another Sunday, la la la, is that cafe open for lunch? Oh no, it isn’t, how strange, la la la, we’ll just wander around until we find some coffee, we’re too busy taking a selfie of our lovely weekend to move off the pavement and give two metres of space to that elderly woman walking past us, la la la. The ones I saw playing football in the local park when I took the poor dog for his now very hurried daily 10-minute walk. The ones shaking germ-ridden hands with careless abandon while I mentally nosedived between them in slow-motion while screaming: “Noooooooo!”

By the time a woman came up to me (while I backed up nervily in order to maintain the requisite two metres and she edged ever closer, as if we were about to break into some kind of traditional dance) and asked where the playground was, I had reached my endpoint.

“You shouldn’t be taking your child to the playground anyway!” I barked. And then, as if to prove my kid-advice credentials, I added: “I have three children locked up at home! It’s the best way!” Realising that I had made myself sound a bit like Josef Fritzl, I reckoned it was probably time to head back to the bunker.

When it comes to failing to self-isolate or practise social distancing, surely everyone feels free to tell off members of their family. Telling each other off is what having a family is all about! OK, maybe it is about a bit more than that, but if you can’t be honest with the teenagers or older people in your family and tell them – for their own sakes and the sakes of others – to stay the frick inside for Gawd’s sake, then you really need to work on your familial relations.

Friends, too, deserve your honesty. So, if you have friends that mention they are heading to their (heretofore never mentioned) second home, you are fully within your rights to tell them to stop being selfish Typhoid Marys, bringing their germs to a little country village that is unequipped to handle a pandemic, all because they want a nice view from the kitchen.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘You have to go home’ ... Italian mayors lose patience with citizens who refuse to self-isolate.

The strangers issue is, I accept, slightly more awkward, especially in Britain, where being approached by a stranger is considered by some to be a breach of their human rights. My favourite online video at the moment shows various Italian mayors screaming at people to stay at home, per l’amor di Dio!

“I saw a fellow citizen amiably jog up and down. I stopped him and said: ‘Look, this isn’t a movie. You are not Will Smith in I Am Legend. You have to go home,’” one recalls. “I’m going to address you all,” another begins. “Where the fuck are you going?!”

Sure, we can blame the UK government for failing to give advice as clearly as Italian mayors are doing. Yes, Boris Johnson is a useless bit of lettuce who always bottles his big moment – NOT NEWS. So, it is not entirely some people’s fault if they do not know what to do. But acknowledging that does not get us very far and, the fact is, the virus is spreading. So, in the absence of the government getting the message across, it is up to us to make like an Italian mayor and tell our fellow citizens what they need to know: you are not Will Smith in I Am Legend. Go home.

Even if you don’t have any coriander stalks to hand you might learn a thing or two

As someone approaching the midpoint of a 14-day quarantine, with a dwindling store cupboard and a fridge that basically now exists as a home for three agoraphobic Mini Babybels, I’ve been awaiting Jamie Oliver’s new daily Channel 4 coronavirus show Keep Cooking and Carry On with a mixture of hope and dread.

Hope, because few television chefs are lucky enough to have Oliver’s flair for mass communication. His school dinners campaign changed an entire industry, his 30 Minute Meals inspired a million copycat cookbooks. In short, when Jamie Oliver says something, people listen. So if he’s rattling out an entire cookery series in less than a week, designed to help self-isolators make the most of what they already have in the house, you can believe it’ll have impact.

But dread, because, well, TV chefs don’t exactly have their finger on the pulse when it comes to knowing what people actually have in the kitchen. Jamie Oliver is a fan of filo pastry and pine nuts and preserved lemons, in a world currently made up of tinned tomatoes and panic-bought penne. There’s a well-established phenomenon where, whenever a TV chef introduces a new ingredient to the world, viewers instantly rush out to supermarkets and buy it. If Oliver was to get too ostentatious by straying from staples and using, say, quinoa flour in a recipe, there’s a real danger he could cause a stampede that the already-struggling food supply chain couldn’t handle.

And, in all honesty, these feelings of dread were borne out during episode one. After greeting us with a surprisingly statesmanlike intro – “We can do this, we can absolutely do this” – Jamie laid out his modus operandi for the series. This was going to be about flexibility, he said. If you don’t have one of the ingredients he suggested, you could always swap it out for something else.

Once he got cooking, though, there was a sense that we were just falling back on Default Jamie. The first recipe was chilli. Despite his assurances – “If you haven’t got an onion, use a leek” – he quickly listed a number of ingredients that were nowhere like anything I have in my house. I kept a list as he went along. I don’t have any garlic. I don’t have any peppers. I don’t have any chickpeas or yoghurt or sweet potatoes. I absolutely don’t have any coriander stalks. Were I to attempt this, I would end up with a bowl of hot tomatoes that tasted vaguely of cumin. And I’m a fancypants Guardian writer, for crying out loud. God knows what those in Jamie’s target demographic have got left.

The second recipe was possibly a little more helpful. After chiding his viewers for nicking all the pasta from supermarkets, he showed us how to make our own. And, in true Jamie Oliver fashion, he made it look like a piece of cake. Bit of flour, bit of water, bish bash bosh, get the kids involved, lovely stuff. I guarantee you, thousands and thousands of homes will be serving homemade pasta tomorrow night as a direct result of this.

Jamie Oliver could do this sort of thing in his sleep. It’s nice to see him in crisis mode, too. There’s no twonking about on a pier with his farmer pal. It’s just Jamie Oliver cooking in a kitchen, which always makes for good telly. And the sheer pace in which this show has been made is massively impressive. There weren’t even any credits at the end of episode one. Between Jamie on dinners and Joe Wicks on PE, you can’t help but feel that the world will be saved by men who are twenty percent too chirpy for normal life.

And yet, despite this, there was still an element of Keep Cooking and Carry On that felt a little too much like Boris Johnson’s coronavirus press briefings. It was enthusiastic, but also quite vague in places, and it assumed a lot of knowledge that the public might not necessarily have. Luckily, like the briefings, this series is being made on the fly. There’s every possibility that he’ll respond to feedback and alter his recipes down the line.

On the whole, then, pretty good and really well intentioned. If ITV had any sense, it’d snap up Jack Monroe and get her version on the air as quickly as possible."

I asked him: “Are you single?”’,"How we met: ‘He was the most beautiful man I’d ever seen. I asked him: “Are you single?”’

Hannah was on her way home from work in London when she noticed the tube attendant on the platform. “I just thought he was the most beautiful man I had ever seen.” This was three years after a painful breakup, when she believed she was, finally, “totally at peace” with being single.

She felt “a fluttering feeling” as their eyes met. “I’ve never felt such intense magnetism,” she says. But afterwards Hannah, now 31, could not remember which platform, or even the station, she had seen the man on.

She looked out for him for weeks. Then, after leaving her office early one day, she saw him again – at Finsbury Park station. Next time, she promised herself, she would ask him out.

The next day, there he was again.

It was busy on the platform, so she hung back, steeling herself to go up to him. Ten minutes passed – and three or four trains. Imran noticed her still standing there on the platform. “You still here?” he asked.

It was not “the most confidence-building thing” that has ever been said to her, Hannah remembers – but she seized her chance.

“I said to him: ‘Are you a single man?’ He was very taken aback and said: ‘What, me?’ I thought: ‘Well, who else am I talking to?’”

Imran did not have a working phone – which Hannah would come to know as typical of his haphazard approach to comms – so she gave him her business card.

Imran, now 44, says he had never been asked out at work before. “It was a big surprise – a nice surprise.”

He had noticed Hannah on the platform: “I thought she was gorgeous.” He also thought she might be “dangerous”. “To be honest, I was a bit worried. I was thinking: ‘What does she want to get with me for?’”

At the time, Imran had been single for seven years, busy raising two children – then aged 16 and 17 – from a previous relationship. Dating had not been a priority.

Their first date was a few days later at a pub near the station – “not even a nice pub”, says Hannah. She still ribs Imran about meeting her round the corner from where he worked, so his colleagues wouldn’t see them.

She had worried there would be awkward silences, but they were still talking at closing time. It came as “a bit of a shock” to learn that Imran had two teenagers, Hannah says – “I took a huge gulp of my gin and tonic” – but it did not put her off. After the pub closed, Imran took Hannah to his favourite local chicken shop, and they ate sitting on a bench outside a club.

It was “relaxed and convenient”, rather than glamorous, says Hannah – but they went on only one more “datey date”. “It became quite domestic quite quickly.”

She remembers a point about six months in when Imran said he would be gone for an hour, then got caught up in errands and family, and went off-grid for the day – “a typical Imran thing”, she now knows. “I realised, as I was imagining these terrible scenarios, that I loved him, and that was why I was so irrationally worried and upset.

“It all came out in this blubbery mess. I thought there was no way that this man was going to tell me he loved me, too – that he was far too guarded – but then he did.”

A little over a year after their first date, just before Christmas, Hannah moved in with Imran and his younger son in Islington. “The house just feels better,” says Imran.

He describes his relationship with Hannah as “two worlds meeting”, but they share values and like to spend time in the same way. He says she is intelligent, articulate, caring, empathic. “I like everything about her. She’s so good at everything she does, she doesn’t take any shit – I like that a lot.”

Hannah says Imran is open-minded, patient, forgiving – “the yin to my yang”. “He’s got bundles of tolerance and compassion where I’m quick to be impatient, annoyed and judgmental. He’s definitely helped me to be a better person.”

They bring out the best in each other, Imran agrees – this interview being a case in point. “I really wouldn’t normally do something like this because I’m such a private person. I think what did it, was she said: ‘Maybe it will give hope to somebody else.’”

https://www.theguardian.com/international,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/salmonds-victory-in-court-leaves-questions-over-role-of-snp,2020-03-23T20:57:09,Alex Salmond's court win leaves questions over role of SNP,"Over nearly nine days of often contradictory and emotionally charged evidence, the jurors in Alex Salmond’s trial on 14 charges of sexual assault heard two conflicting accounts of the former first minister.

One version was of an often bad-tempered boss who drove his staff hard, with poor judgment about personal space. His defence advocate, Gordon Jackson QC, told the jury of nine women and six men that Salmond was flawed but not evil; he was certainly not a man guilty of criminality or an attempt to rape.

“This comes out of a political bubble with no real independent support of any kind,” Jackson said. Many of the charges smelled, he added, of political persecution. “This is a murky, murky world we live in,” he said. Salmond insisted some charges were “a fabrication from start to finish”.

The prosecution portrayed Salmond as a predator, who abused his power and authority to assault younger women, often at night in the seclusion of his Bute House official residence in Edinburgh’s Georgian New Town.

“This case isn’t about a plot or political conspiracy,” Alex Prentice QC told them. “This is about a powerful man who abused his power to satisfy his sexual desires with impunity.”

In the event, the jury – reduced on Monday from 15 to 13 after two jury members were discharged, accepted Jackson’s account. In a verdict that sent shockwaves through the Scottish National party, they acquitted Salmond of every charge on majority verdicts. He had already been acquitted of a 10th sexual assault after the prosecution withdrew the charge earlier in the trial.

Speaking outside court on Monday, Salmond issued a thinly concealed warning to his former party and Nicola Sturgeon, his successor as first minister and party leader, that he planned to disclose more evidence in coming days and weeks.

“There was certain evidence I would like to have seen [presented] in this trial but for a variety of reasons we weren’t able to do so,” he told the media. “At some point that information, that fact and that evidence will see the light of day.”

Salmond’s jubilant allies now believe a forthcoming Scottish parliament inquiry into the Scottish government’s botched handling of an internal investigation into two complaints against him by civil servants will dig deeper into the role played by Sturgeon’s staff and senior officials in that investigation, and the subsequent police inquiry.

He has now been exonerated by the jury of any crimes – but the parliamentary investigation could also be significantly expanded after the trial heard how complaints from several civil servants who raised concerns about Salmond’s behaviour were dealt with by their line managers and other senior officials.

The court heard that officials in Salmond’s office decided in 2013 and 2014 not to record or seek investigation of their complaints about his behaviour towards them.

The women involved told the jury they felt humiliated and embarrassed, and feared making formal complaints would damage their careers or, one told the jury, that the matter would be “swept under the carpet”. They opted instead to do so off the record.

After a young junior official accused Salmond of forcing her on to a bed in December 2013 – a charge Salmond denied – senior civil servants in his private office decided among themselves not to allow female officials to work alone at night with him at Bute House, according to evidence.

That complainer, known as F because his accusers cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed at Salmond’s trial that he pinned her on a bed and forced his hands up her skirt.

She said she did not report the full details of her allegations to her colleagues. Even so, the jury heard that one colleague in Salmond’s office told her the next day: “It could be a crime.” He told the court: “It gave me cause for concern that something serious had happened.”

Instead of an investigation, the jury heard that the officials and Salmond’s most senior aide brokered an apology from Salmond. Those officials told the court they felt F wanted the issue kept low-key, so were respecting her wishes.

Salmond told the jury that he and F had fallen on to the bed in a “sleepy cuddle” after drinking a potent Chinese spirit while they worked. The jury acquitted him of alleged sexual assault with intent to rape.

After a further allegation about an incident at Bute House four months later, the same officials told the court they tried to reinforce the practice of not allowing female officials to work alone there with Salmond.

In that case, the court was told, another male civil servant received a distressed late-night text from a younger female colleague, G. She alleged in court that Salmond cornered her in his private sitting room and tried to kiss her after pressing her to drink limoncello with him, which she refused.

G said initially she felt “it was never an option” to report the incident internally or to the police. “I felt a huge responsibility to protect his reputation. [I] thought if I got into some sort of scandal with him, it would lose the referendum,” she told the jury.

The court heard that a colleague persuaded G to complain informally but she remained deeply doubtful that the process would work. She told the court that she had doubts about the competence of the civil service and feared, correctly, that Salmond would sue the government.

In August 2018, Salmond launched a judicial review against his former government after being told an internal civil service inquiry had upheld two sexual assault complaints against him – findings that were not ultimately allowed to stand. After quickly raising £100,000 via crowdfunding to help with his legal costs, he won that challenge in January 2019.

The Scottish government repeatedly told journalists in 2017, 2018 and 2019 that no complaints of sexual misconduct or bullying had been made against Salmond until two of these complainers – the legal term in Scotland for complainants – came forward in late 2017, after the #MeToo movement pushed ministers into announcing a zero-tolerance stance on sexual misconduct.

According to their testimony in court, none of the women were told their allegations could have been investigated under the Scottish government’s then uniquely far-reaching “fairness at work” procedures, which it introduced in autumn 2010.

That policy – the only one of its kind in the UK – specifically included misconduct by Scottish ministers, including first ministers. It committed the government “to dealing with staff grievances fairly, consistently, quickly and no one will be penalised for raising a complaint in good faith”.

Appendix 1 of the document set out “examples of unacceptable behaviour”, which included “inappropriate physical contact, advances or propositions” and “inappropriate questions about someone’s personal life or questions about someone’s sex life”.

That policy was originally drawn up to handle bullying or mistreatment complaints against civil servants but civil service unions insisted it was expanded to include ministers because of alleged bullying incidents involving Salmond himself.

Salmond’s trial heard repeated testimony from defence and prosecution witnesses that he had a fierce temper and was notorious for being aggressive and highly critical with officials he thought were underperforming.

Union sources and those with knowledge of Salmond’s conduct told the Guardian of instances of Salmond swearing at staff, throwing documents at them, and reducing aides to tears.

Union sources acknowledge the policy was not written with sexual misconduct specifically in mind, but said it was clear the policy covered misconduct in its broadest sense.

Salmond told the jury he had signed off on the policy. It was also agreed by Nicola Sturgeon, then the deputy first minister, and Sir John Elvidge, then the permanent secretary of the Scottish government. Sturgeon agreed to be the arbiter of any complaints involving ministers, including allegations against Salmond.

Despite the fairness at work policy being in place at the time, one female civil servant, complainer B, told the jury she felt unable to complain after she claimed that he tried to force her into a kiss.

“I think I would’ve suffered in my career as a result. I never saw anybody in a senior position in the Scottish government tackle the first minister about his behaviour,” she said.

Salmond was found not guilty of that allegation. A senior member of Salmond’s policy team at the time, Alex Bell, told the court last week he had been sent upstairs by two other colleagues to ensure she was safe because they had inadvertently left her alone with Salmond.

Asked why he had gone up, Bell said: “To ensure that the welfare of my colleague was OK.” Their stance mirrored the policies followed three years later by Salmond’s private secretaries.

It took until late 2017 before these women felt confident to report these allegations, when Sturgeon and Scotland’s head civil servant, Leslie Evans, reacted to the #MeToo movement by introducing a tougher code of conduct that specifically included sexual misconduct. Crucially, it applied retrospectively to former ministers.

Two of the women who had felt unable to pursue complaints initially stepped forwards, triggering an internal Scottish government inquiry that upheld their complaints. That led the police to investigate, and resulted in Salmond being charged with 14 counts of sexual assault – but ultimately acquitted."
https://www.theguardian.com/international,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/23/remarkably-talented-the-epic-photography-of-kenny-rogers,2020-03-23T18:49:12,'Remarkably talented': the epic photography of Kenny Rogers,"From the fatalistic blues of The Gambler to the mournful lament of Lucille, Kenny Rogers sang songs full of emotion, courage, drama and heartache. Although his cautionary Americana fables didn’t always have a happy ending, the raspy-voiced musician delivered them with more warmth than a shot of bourbon around a campfire, somehow ensuring that you always ended up smiling.

But the celebrated country singer, who has died of natural causes at the age of 81, wasn’t just great at telling stories through song. He also used photography, releasing several books, and receiving an honorary degree from the Professional Photographers of America (PPA). “He’s obviously well-known as an entertainer,” said PPA president Ralph Romaguera when giving Rogers his award in 2014, “but he truly is a remarkably talented photographer, too.”

Covering landscapes and portraits, Rogers’ images shift between giddily capturing the larger-than-life personas of such friends as Ray Charles and Dolly Parton, to documenting the natural beauty of America’s vast countryside. He could make familiar sights look like a fairytale: his glowing night time shot of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, proudly uploaded to his Facebook page in 2017, makes the 16th US president look more like a mystical levitating god than a statue for tourists to mill around.

Armed with a 35mm Brownie Hawkeye, Rogers enjoyed taking long walks on the look-out for unique trees. The camera also became a way to stave off boredom while touring America and bringing his signature brand of accessibly nostalgic country pop to fan-filled arenas. “I only worked an hour a day,” Rogers said of life on the road in 2014. “That meant I had 23 hours with nothing to do.”

In that interview, with Sports & Entertainment Nashville, he added: “So we’d get up in the morning, get in the car, and drive around whatever city we were in and ask the locals whether there was anything good to shoot. A lot of the time they’d say, ‘No, I’ve lived here 30 year and there’s nothing.’ And then you’d turn round the corner and you’d find Niagara Falls.”

Although he loved taking portraits of his fourth wife, the model Marianne Gordon, Rogers clearly saw photography as much more than just a hobby. At the height of his fame in the 1980s and 90s, he found time for private lessons with acclaimed American photographers, from Yousuf Karsh to John Sexton. “Karsh taught me how to capture the personality of a celebrity by making them feel at ease,” said Rogers. “When you see them totally relaxed, that’s when you shoot. John taught me the importance of really loving what you photograph.”

Working under these giants of photography, Rogers reached another level. His equipment grew more sophisticated, too. He moved from a Linhof Master Technika 4x5-inch to larger-format cameras capable of producing more arresting 8x10 negatives. The Thumb, one of his most striking shots, captures a digit-like mountaintop in bold black and white. With the moon hovering low in the sky and the stark rock outlines, it resembles a still from a science-fiction movie, lit with dark mystique.

Like many of Rogers’s environmental photographs, it has real depth, accentuating the shadows. It’s as if he was suggesting that America, even at its most beautiful, had something sinister lurking in the darkness. You could say the same about many of his songs, particularly Ruby, Don’t Take Your Love to Town.

His celebrity portraits are particularly vivid. In 1987, Rogers published Your Friends and Mine, full of portraits of superstars from Elizabeth Taylor to Michael Jackson. He also photographed the likes of Willie Nelson and Tammy Wynette for his 2005 photo book This Is My Country. Most of these celebrities looks at ease and relaxed, acutely aware that the person behind the camera was one of them and had no agenda.

That said, Rogers’s shot of Michael Jackson awkwardly clutching his pet chimpanzee Bubbles like a ventriloquist’s dummy feels as if it was intended to be a little more ironic than his usual work. Here, arguably, Rogers captured the unnerving bombast of Jackson’s eccentric celebrity more clearly than just about any other photographer.

One of Rogers’s biggest lessons came from the Canadian portrait photographer George Hurrell, who taught the singer how to create a connection with his subjects that would spill over into the final product.

“He came down to my place in Georgia and spent some time with me,” Rogers told the Associated Press. “George said to me, ‘I am gonna tell you a trick. I call it the stolen moment!’ He said to talk to your subject about the happiest day of their life and also the saddest day of their life. Just as they respond to the question, you take the picture. It means they are not posing, but rather being who they truly are. It’s honestly such a great trick.”

Often, when celebrities announce that they enjoy taking photographs, we brace ourselves for a dire, staged selfie or shot of a lurid pink swimming pool. Rogers was proof that, occasionally, a celebrity could be just as arresting behind the camera as they were in front of it.

Last June, Rogers posted one of his photos to Instagram, something he did regularly in his later years. Taken while on tour, it deals with all the things the country singer seemed to be most fond of: epic mountaintops, gorgeous if slightly eerie moonlight, and trees that stand like gods. It’s easy to imagine a silver-haired Rogers, probably in a cowboy hat, smiling behind the camera, just taking it all in."

“Ultimately, I have to make a decision, but I certainly listen to them,” Trump said when asked if he would follow the advice of Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx about loosening national guidelines restricting the behavior of the American people.

The president spoke with reporters for over an hour and a half during a White House press briefing on Monday evening.

Trump said he had “respect” for Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx but suggested that they would likely err on the side of caution.

“If it were up to the doctors, they may say, ‘Let’s keep it shut down, let’s shut down the entire world … and let’s keep it shut for a couple of years,'” he said. “We can’t do that.”

When asked if Fauci agreed with him that the economy should open soon, Trump replied, “He doesn’t not agree with me.”

But the president said that he would be the one making decisions about the future, citing his “double obligation” to the American people. He also warned about the rising mortality rate as a result of losing the American economy:

We have people get tremendous anxiety and depression and you have suicides over things like this when you have terrible economies. You have death probably, definitely would be in far greater numbers than the numbers we’re talking about with regard to the virus.

He compared the mortality rates for suicides, car crashes, and the ordinary flu to the coronavirus death rate and said that had to be weighed before making a decision.

“The whole concept of death is terrible,” Trump said. “But there’s a tremendous difference between one percent and four or five.”

The president ultimately said that America could keep the economy going and fight the virus and said it would be irresponsible to shut down the country longer than necessary.

“We’re going to come up with a date and we’re going to do two things,” he said. “We can do two things at one time. At the same time, we’re going to be very vigilant.”

Trump said the tough restrictions on Americans would be “weeks not months” and said updated guidelines eventually might vary for certain age groups and different hot spots in the country."

“It’s very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world,” he said Monday during a White House press briefing.

“They’re amazing people. And the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, s, or form,” he added.

Leftists have claimed that Trump’s usage of the words “Chinese virus” to describe the coronavirus is instigating racism against Asian Americans. Trump said he uses the term because the virus came from Wuhan, China. China has been trying to deny that the virus originated in China and has even blamed U.S. Army soldiers for bringing it to Wuhan.

Several cases of racism in the U.S. have been reported, although some appear to be perpetuated by other minorities against Asian Americans.

Trump also tweeted earlier on Monday:

It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world. They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER!

….is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020

Asked what prompted his remarks about Asian Americans, Trump responded: “It seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language towards the Asian Americans in our country and I don’t like that at all.”

“These are incredible people. They love our country and I’m not going to let it happen,” he said. “They are making statements to Great American citizens that happen to be of Asian heritage and I’m not going to let that happen.”

“They’re working closely with us to get rid of it,” he said. “We will prevail together. It’s very important.”

A new poll released by Monmouth University on Monday indicates that 50 percent of Americans across the country believe the president is doing a good job in handling the crisis, compared to 45 percent who do not. When broken down along partisan lines, Trump’s performance was rated significantly better among Republicans (89 percent) and independents (48 percent) than Democrats, only 19 percent of whom thought the president was doing a good job.

Despite the partisan divergence, Trump’s management of the crisis was viewed more than favorable than that of both congress (42 percent) and the media (45 percent). In fact, the president only trailed the nation’s governors and federal health agencies when it came to who was handling the pandemic best.

The poll, which was conducted between March 18 through 22 by surveying 851 individuals nationally, is the first to come out since the coronavirus pandemic forced non-essential businesses, schools, and other venues to shut down across the country.

Trump, for his part, has taken an active approach in leading the U.S.’s efforts to fight the pandemic. The president was an early proponent of banning travel to-and-from China, where the coronavirus first appeared. Since then, the president has expanded his travel ban to include Europe and Canada, which have seen massive increases over the past three weeks.

In recent days, the Trump administration has also been negotiating with congress on a relief package for small businesses and workers impacted by the efforts taken to mitigate the contagion’s spread.

The public seems to be taking notice of such efforts. The Monmouth poll found that the president’s overall approval rating had climbed since the coronavirus outbreak. In February, Monmouth indicated that only 44 percent of voters approved of the job Trump was doing in the White House, while 50 percent disapproved. This month, however, those numbers rose sharply, with 46 percent approving of the job Trump was doing, while only 48 percent disapproved."
http://www.breitbart.com/,http://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/03/23/pelosi-stimulus-bill-imposes-nationwide-ballot-harvesting-without-any-limit/,2020-03-23T00:00:00,Pelosi ‘Stimulus’ Bill Imposes Nationwide ‘Ballot Harvesting’ Without ‘Any Limit’,"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s new stimulus bill would mandate nationwide “ballot harvesting,” allowing party operatives to return other people’s ballots to polling places without “any limit” on the number of ballots.

“Ballot harvesting” was legalized in California in 2016, and first used in the 2018 midterm elections. It allows anyone to drop off someone else’s mail-in ballot at a polling station. There is no process for vetting or verifying those delivering the ballots — no background checks or identification requirements. Democrats dropped hundreds of thousands of ballots off at polling stations in 2018, helping Democrats as they flipped seven Republican seats.

The practice is illegal in most other states, largely because it is susceptible to fraud and intimidation. Republicans were caught flat-footed in 2018; they experimented with the tactic in recent special elections, only to find that their voters adamantly refuse to give their ballots to strangers. Democrats are more open to the practice — often because the “harvester” previously registered the voter, according to Republican National Committeeman Shawn Steel.

California’s “ballot harvesting” law has yet to be challenged in court. It is one reason that California remains a one-party state, with little prospect for change in the foreseeable future.

Pelosi wants to take that system nationwide.

Her bill, released Monday afternoon, provides that every state:

A) shall permit a voter to designate any person to return a voted and sealed absentee ballot to the post office, a ballot drop-off location, tribally designated building, or election office so long as the person designated to return the ballot does not receive any form of compensation based on the number of ballots that the person has returned and no individual, group, or organization provides compensation on this basis; and (B) may not put any limit on how many voted and sealed absentee ballots any designated person can return to the post office, a ballot drop off location, tribally designated building, or election office.

In other words, paid party operatives can literally truck thousands and thousands of ballots to the polls, provided they earn a salary or fee, and are not paid by the ballot.

It is a practice that is known in Third World countries as “ballot stuffing,” and is outlawed in every democracy, no matter how poor — even in countries where the physical and administrative obstacles to voting are far greater than in the world’s most developed economy.

And it is Pelosi’s condition for saving the U.S. economy from coronavirus.

Host Chris Hayes asked Schiff about the criticism that Democrats “sort of see this opportunity to get a bunch of stuff you wanted anyway, in under the cover of emergency legislation. What’s your response to that?”

Schiff responded, “I think what they’re really focused on is, we want to make sure that we protect, not only the health of the economy, but the health of our democracy. And for that reason, we want to make sure that we provide that people can vote by mail, and have early voting. We saw the fiasco in Ohio. We don’t want that repeated. And I think what Donald Trump would like, what Mitch McConnell would like is a situation where they can create a corporate slush fund that they can do with as they choose, and the voters won’t be able to hold them accountable. Because they won’t be able to get to the ballot places without risking their lives. And so, we view the economic health and the health of our democracy as very much interrelated. They view the health of their slush fund and suppressing the vote as interrelated, and I think that’s part of the conflict.”

Schweizer offered his recommendation on Monday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. The two discussed Sen. Richard Burr’s (R-NC) recent selling of between $628,000 and $1.72 million in stock ahead of coronavirus-related market declines.

Congress’s access to information not made available to the public — via confidential briefings and other means — opens the door to insider trading, noted Schweizer, additionally highlighting Congress’s power to affect markets given its control of government appropriations.

Broad public distrust of Congress arises from people’s knowledge of representatives and senators making self-interested funding decisions that benefit their portfolios and financial interests.

“Here’s the problem,” said Schweizer, addressing proposed relief funds for airline companies and other industries particularly damaged by the coronavirus pandemic, “members of Congress can trade stock in Delta Airlines or Boeing while they’re working on this bailout — while they’re voting on it — and it just throws the integrity of the whole process into question.”

Schweizer added, “Members of Congress, is it worth it to have the American people distrust you so you can make some extra side money by insider trading on the market? Because that’s really ultimately what this is about. There’s no legitimate explanation or reason that they can give for them not to be required to put their assets in a blind trust.”

LISTEN:

Schweizer reiterated his call for the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Burr’s stock dump and to prosecute the North Carolina senator for insider trading based on violations of the STOCK Act.

“I can’t even believe they have the nerve to spit in the face of Americans who are now unemployed,” said Rosemary Jenks, policy director at the NumbersUSA. The GOP and President Donald Trump must oppose the “Foreign Workers First bill,” she said. “Americans are being laid off right and left … Americans are going to need all the help they can get.”

“Congress seems hell-bent on replacing Americans with foreigners,” said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “We’re going to have 30 percent unemployment or more — higher than the Great Depression — and yet we are going to bring in more people from abroad? It surreal.”

“This House bill is disgusting,” said Marie Larson, a co-founder of the American Workers Coalition, which organizes U.S. graduates to oppose companies’ growing use of foreign visa workers. “It is an overreach; it has to be called out.”

“During the public health emergency …. [officials] shall temporarily suspend or modify any procedural requirement with which an applicant, petitioner, or other person or entity must otherwise comply under the immigration law,” says Sec. 10607 on page 63 of the 1,119-page House draft.

The suspensions are intended to “ensure the timely and fair adjudication of applications or petitions … [to] prevent hardship to applicants, petitions, beneficiaries, or other persons or entities, including by granting automatic or other extensions or renewals when necessary to protect individuals from lapses in status or work authorizations.”

At a time when millions of Americans could lose their jobs, Pelosi’s bill includes a measure to automatically extend nonimmigrant work visas. https://t.co/t1n9nWFC0W pic.twitter.com/MvXTKrBnIn — Ben Goldey (@BenGoldey) March 23, 2020

The bill would even allow H-1B visa workers to stay long past the six-term limit on their temporary stays. For example, the foreign workers who are expected to go home in the next 12 months will instead be allowed to “automatically extend such status or work authorization for the same time period as the alien’s prior status or work authorization.” For H-1Bs, the “same time period’ is three years.

The bill would keep several hundred thousand white-collar visa workers and several hundred thousand blue-collar work-permit workers in the U.S. labor market, even as unemployment is expected to spike past 20 percent.

The bill would also provide a massive giveaway to the many technology, banking, insurance, and staffing companies that have replaced a huge number of U.S. graduates with large blocs of compliant Indian and Chinese graduates.

Without the House language, these wealthy companies would be forced to hire hundreds of thousands of American graduates if their lobbyists cannot persuade the administration to renew the foreign workers’ expiring permits during the massive surge of unemployment among white-collar Americans before the 2020 election.

The visa extensions are backed by FWD.us, a lobby group for West Coast Investors.

The legislation also matches the goals of Compete America. The lobby group has been pushing Congress to pass the S.386 green card giveaway to roughly 300,0000 Indian Hi-1B workers who are employed in the United States by technology, banking, insurance, and staffing companies.

In mid-March, the Department of Homeland Security said it had not stopped plans to deliver 85,000 college-graduate H-1B visa workers to U.S companies.

“You could make an argument for extending current visas, just to prevent disruption,” said Krikorian. “Paired with that would have to be a freeze on future visas [because] you can’t have it both ways – then everyone gets to stay, and more new people would be allowed in,” he said.

‘If your time is up, you should need to go home,” Krikorian added.

“I would hope that the administration would oppose it,” said Jenks, adding:

American workers are going to need all the help they can get. We need to focus on putting Americans back to work … Hopefully, we will start getting the economy rolling again in less than 43 months, and those jobs are going to be needed by Americans who are being laid off.

“I’m not sure this would be [bad] enough for Trump to veto this bill,” said Kirkorian, adding:

There is so much else going on and in such a panic. I expect that the tech lobbyists’ are counting on Trump being very reluctant to veto this bill. Really, the responsibility is on Republican legislatures to make sure he is not presented with that choice. The problem is that the Republicans are just as bad as the Democrats when it comes to preferring visa workers over Americans, but there are some honorable exceptions.

Democrats are trying to make Trump eat a “cap sandwich,” Krikorian said. The Republicans’ job “is to make sure the President is not presented with distasteful actions like this.”

American professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers. The new TechsUnite.US site was created to help U.S. graduates anonymously collaborate while shielded by encryption.

In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher.

Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries."
http://www.breitbart.com/,http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/tom-cotton-slams-democrats-for-delaying-coronavirus-relief-disgraceful/,2020-03-23T00:00:00,Tom Cotton Slams Democrats for Delaying Coronavirus Relief: Disgraceful,"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) criticized his Democratic colleagues in the Senate on Monday for delaying the coronavirus relief package, claiming such efforts were “disgraceful.”

Cotton, who has been a firm advocate of getting cash into the hands” of American workers displaced by the pandemic, accused Senate Democrats of reneging on legislation to provide immediate economic relief. Democrats, the senator claimed, were holding workers and small businesses hostage in hopes of attaining a more politically favorable deal.

Cotton said from the Senate floor:

There is a good bill, a bill that was negotiated in good faith . . . that [Democrats] are now blocking, they will not even start debate on [it] because of ideological wish-list items. It is disgraceful and it is dangerous to the lives of our people and their economic well-being.

Cotton’s comments came shortly after Democrats blocked a second attempt to move the relief package forward. Negotiated over the week by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, the deal, if implemented, would provide every American earning less than $75,000-per-year a $1,200 cash payment to stimulate the economy during the pandemic. The proposal also included a $500 billion grant and funding program for businesses adversely impacted by the virus.

On Sunday, the deal looked to be all but finalized, until Pelosi opted to walk away and craft her own stimulus package, claiming the original was too beneficial to large corporations. Many, though, believe the Speaker and her fellow Democrats are politicizing a national crisis.

That image was only enhanced on Monday when Pelosi released the draft version of her relief legislation, which included provisions for same-day voter registration, automatic extension of nonimmigrant visas, and mandates for “corporate board diversity,” among others.

Cotton, himself, took to social media after his floor speech to highlight some of the more “absurd provisions completely unrelated to the crisis at hand” that were stuffed into the Speaker’s relief bill.

1. Corporate pay statistics by race and race statistics for all corporate boards at companies receiving assistance 2. Bailing out all current debt of postal service 3. Required early voting 4. Required same day voter registration 5. 10k bailout for student loans — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) March 23, 2020

10. Retirement plans for community newspaper employees 11. $15 minimum wage at companies receiving assistance 12. Permanent paid leave at companies receiving assistance — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) March 23, 2020

Other Senate Republicans were just as quick to repudiate Pelosi and her counterparts in the Senate for their actions. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) had perhaps the most colorful of rebukes on Monday, when addressing his colleagues from the Senate floor.

“Do you know what the American people are thinking right now,” Kennedy said. “They’re thinking that the brain is an amazing organ. It starts working in a mother’s womb, and it doesn’t stop working until you get elected to Congress.”"

Mike Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Monday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) “highjacked” bipartisan negotiations to the detriment of the American public’s health.

Pelosi and Schumer decided to nix bipartisan negotiations over the third phase of the congressional coronavirus response package on Sunday. Instead, Pelosi decided to craft her own bill in the House, which would significantly delay the American people’s and businesses’ ability to receive relief in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

Senate Democrats blocked for the second time in 24 hours a procedural motion that would allow for the Senate to continue debating and subsequently pass the coronavirus package.

Braun told Breitbart News that there was “no doubt” that Democrats were playing with the American people’s lives by delaying crucial aid to the American public.

“I think, for the Democrats, it’s been highjacked by Pelosi and Schumer trying to extract more stuff out of it, maybe the far-left side of their party to do it as well,” he added.

The Hoosier senator said that he had talked to four or five Democrat senators that believe that they could still come to a bipartisan agreement on a coronavirus package after addressing a few minor issues.

Braun explained, “I talked to four or five Democrats today to see what the actual issues that were most important to most of them. And, it was stuff we could all live with, and that was plussing up a bit, not much, for hospitals, for defense against the coronavirus …. state and local governments are going to have issues with employees not showing up, especially in the urban areas. And, then, the last one was the full transparency on the emergency stabilization fund, especially as it would relate to the airline industry, and I was good with that. Everyone from ‘Main Street’ like me wants to make sure when the government starts interfacing with larger businesses, there’s full transparency.”

Instead of focusing on these issues during their negotiations with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Braun said that Democrats had moved forward with a “laundry list” of change to the bill that includes “climate issues, employment policy, minimum wage.”

Braun’s interview with Breitbart News follows as McConnell said on the Senate floor on Monday that some Democrats are “embarrassed” that Pelosi and Schumer blocked the bipartisan relief package.

The Hoosier senator said that he did not “extract” any admission of embarrassment from his Democrat colleagues, “but I could tell since they weren’t defending” Pelosi and Schumer’s actions, that he knew the Democrats understood they were in the wrong.

Braun said that there is “no excuse” for the Senate not to pass this coronavirus package Monday night through unanimous consent.

Braun, however, warned, “If we don’t, we have to wait until Wednesday morning and the American public, I think, will be going through the roof in terms of disappointment and anger in terms of what’s going on here.”

The Hoosier conservative noted that Republicans needed to force the Democrats to continually vote down the procedural motion to fight back against Pelosi and Schumer’s political stunt.

“I think if we didn’t do what we had done, they would be playing even more footsie with it,” Braun said.

Braun concluded, noting that Republicans and Democrats can still come together and pass the coronavirus package to help the American people.

He said that congressional leaders should “tweak” the three areas of Democrat concern and “take care of the American public.”"

American graduates “must act now to ensure the huge pending layoffs are imposed on Indian H-1Bs instead of on Americans,” said Marie Larson, a co-founder of the American Workers Coalition.

American and Indian managers have already replaced American graduates with an army of roughly one million Indian white-collar workers, including roughly 750,0000 H-1B workers. Hundreds of thousands of other visa and work-permit workers are imported from China, Europe, and Asia under rules allowing renewable stays one to three years.

Many of these visa workers are hidden from media outlets and American employees because they are hired via a network of Indian-run subcontracting firms, such as Tata or Infosys. House Democrats — aided by business lobbyists — have drafted a bill to protect the visa workers, and the Department of Homeland Security took two steps last week to help accelerate the 2020 arrival of 85,000 more H-1B workers.

American managers will be reluctant to fire their visa workers, in part, because it is more difficult to rebuild a visa-worker labor force than it is to rehire fired Americans.

“There’s plenty of evidence that Indian managers will be reluctant to fire fellow Indians,” said Ron Hira, an expert on the outsourcing industry and an associate professor at Howard University. “There are cultural network effects on hiring — anybody who studies diversity and underrepresented minorities or females knows these things have effects [because] people tend or hire people who they are comfortable with, who are like them,” he said.

“If an H-1B gets laid off, they have to leave the country, and that can be a devastating experience, particularly if they have a house and a family here,” Hira said. “They will be much more desperate to keep their jobs. … Those folks are so desperate they will work for nothing,” he added.

Americans “have to band together,” said Kevin Lynn, founder of USTechworkers.com, adding:

That means you have to make a collective decision to go to management and make your demands. You have to band together and meet with your legislators at municipal, country, state and federal levels. You have to do it immediately. You run the risk of getting fired, but the reality is that they are going to fire you anyway. That’s the plan … The time to fight back is now.

“You go as high up as you can, to the CEO, the director of human resources,” said James Otto, a California lawyer who has won court cases for Americans who were fired so the companies could import Indian workers. He continued:

If you don’t do this, you lose. But if you do this, the range of outcomes starts with you get to keep your jobs – maybe with less pay, but you keep your benefits. You can negotiate, and if they say no, you’ve gained documentation of discrimination and it is illegal discrimination and you can sue on that.

Americans graduates have the law on their side, said Otto.

Companies have to promise that the H-1B will not disadvantage Americans when they first ask the government for permission to import H-1B workers.

According to a summary by Cornell University’s law school:

The employers’ commitment is made in the “Labor Condition Application” form:

The employer shall provide working conditions for nonimmigrants which will not adversely affect the working conditions of workers similarly employed. The employer’s obligation regarding working conditions shall extend for the duration of the validity period of the certified LCA or the period during which the worker(s) working pursuant to this LCA is employed by the employer, whichever is longer.

The rules are tighter for companies that are deemed an “H-1B Dependent” employer:

An H-1B dependent or willful violator employer is prohibited from displacing a U.S. worker in its own workforce within the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of filing of the visa petition.

“Get organized. Gather evidence … collect documents,” said John Miano, a lawyer at the Immigration Reform Law Institute. “Fifty people bringing a case adds a lot more weight.”

The H-1B laws provide little or no protection for Americans graduates, he said. But lawsuits can be based on patterns of executives’ discrimination against Americans in favor of people who are not citizens or not Americans, he said. The lawsuits can also be brought against companies that keep many workers on subcontractors’ payrolls. “It is tougher to prove,” he said, adding, “It ain’t what you know, it is what you can prove.”

Americans also need to lobby Congress and get media attention before they are fired, Larson said. “It is a time for action, even if it puts people at risk — putting your heads down, keeping anomalous, it’s not having an impact,” she said.

The Indian H-1B workers are lobbying Congress to preserve their work permits and jobs, so Americans must accept that politics is more important than their technical expertise, she said. “We need every American graduate to push this issue as much as possible. … They need to call, email, and tweet their senators and reps daily.”

Indians will shout “Racism!” at American employees who rally their black, white, Latino, Asian, native-born, and immigrant peers into a group to protect their economic rights and their jobs, Larson said. “Whenever anybody shouts the word ‘racism!’ everybody freezes,” she said. But the Indian groups already organize themselves to fight in Congress for jobs, she said:

Immigration Voice is the lobbying group that is heavily lobbying our Congress, including on bringing in more visa workers and the green card giveaway [S.386], has become a master of using “Racism!” as a whip to cow the American people into going with their demands.

“The Indians are a group of groups, they look out for themselves,” said Lynn, adding:

We see ample evidence of preferential treatment. They look out for people of their nation, their caste, their region, and hence we see case after case of country-of-origin discrimination and preferential hiring for their in-group.

Over the last two years, American professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers.

The new TechsUnite.US site was created to help U.S. graduates anonymously collaborate while shielded by encryption.

In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher.

Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries.

The racism claims that are routinely thrown at Americans are the reverse of the workplace reality, Larson said. “Yes, there is discrimination, but it is in favor of Indians, and it is done by U.S. executives,” because they prefer to hire and fire cheap, compliant labor from India, she said, adding:

Our hard-fought employee rights are being pushed to the curb. The message has been entirely skewed so that visa workers can come in saying “We want diversity,” “Don’t be racist,” but Americans for decades have been fighting for employee rights, rights for women, for minorities, and these are all just being stepped over. … [Americans] are being pushed aside — even Chinese-Americans and Asian-Americans to a great extent. Indians are just dominating [in workplaces] and all these other minorities don’t even have any representation [in workplaces] any longer. It is not diversity at all.

The conflict between American employees and visa workers exists because Congress allows companies to hire visa workers who have far fewer rights in the job market than do legal immigrants, he said. “The most important issue is … we should have immigrants and immigration, not guest-worker visas.”

“When you are in these desperate times, it is going to create even more negative, knock-on effects on the labor market,” he said.

Govt data shows 1 million Indian contract-workers get white-collar jobs in tech, banking, health etc.

The Indian hiring ignores many EEOC laws & is expanding amid gov't & media silence.

But Americans’ rights can be enforced by lawsuits, said Otto, who has won million-dollar judgments for Americans who were fired by a California insurance company.

Americans need to document their companies’ staff, collect contacts, performance evaluations, and force executives to explain their decisions, he said. Any deception or smears by executives can dramatically expand lawsuits, he said.

On Sunday, President Donald Trump told the media that his administration was reviewing a plan to free elderly felons deemed “nonviolent” from federal prison to try to prevent a spread of the Chinese coronavirus in prison.

“We have been asked about that and we’re going to take a look at it,” Trump said. “It’s a bit of a problem, but when we talk about totally nonviolent, we’re talking about releasing totally nonviolent prisoners, we are actually looking at that, yes.”

White House / YouTube

The plan, lobbied for by the George Soros-funded American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), has the potential of releasing about 10,000 elderly felons from federal prisons over fears that they could contract the coronavirus while incarcerated.

These felons are considered “nonviolent,” though violent criminals often plead down to nonviolent crimes to shorten their prison sentences. Federal data released in 2018 revealed that more than 97 percent of federal convicts had taken plea deals rather than going to trial for all the crimes they had been charged with in their criminal cases.

Conservative Review’s Daniel Horowitz reports having obtained a letter that the White House Legislative Affairs Office sent to a number of Republican Senators, asking that they immediately pass H.R. 4018 to give early release to thousands of elderly felons:

On Saturday, the White House office of legislative affairs sent a message to Senate staff requesting they pass H.R. 4018, a bill to grant federal prisoners over the age of 60 early release, “as soon as possible.” In case you thought the convoluted logic of using the coronavirus crisis to push the jailbreak agenda was limited to big-city liberal politicians in Baltimore and California, this memo made clear there are those in the White House pushing it. [Emphasis added] “Older inmates are at a unique risk to be affected by the Coronavirus,” read the email from the White House legislative affairs office, which I obtained from a Republican Senate office. “A congressional fix to allow older inmates to be placed in home confinement can help reduce the risk of community spread in a crowded environment.” [Emphasis added]

Already, major areas like Los Angeles, California; Chicago, Illinois; and Cleveland, Ohio, have started releasing hundreds of inmates from local and state prisons — steps their law enforcement officials said are necessary to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, police officers have been advised to stop imprisoning criminals accused of “nonviolent” crimes. This list of crimes includes burglary, auto theft, vandalism, prostitution, and theft.

Pro-life organization Created Equal produced a video of recorded phone requests for information from abortion facilities regarding the decision to continue with “business as usual” during the pandemic:

Mark Harrington, president of Created Equal, said:

The abortion industry claims they perform health care. However, we have evidence that abortion centers across the nation are staying open in the midst of this national health crisis, risking public health and safety. These centers must close their doors to help stop the spread of COVID-19. If they believe in the health of Americans, they have no other choice.

Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio, for example, is refusing to comply with an order by the state’s attorney general that bans nonessential and elective surgical procedures, such as abortions, during the coronavirus pandemic.

A lawyer for the abortion facility responded to a letter from the office of state Attorney General Dave Yost, asserting the order allows Planned Parenthood to “still continue providing essential procedures, including surgical abortion.”

“This is not about abortions,” Bethany McCorkle, a spokesperson for Yost, reportedly told CBS News on Sunday. “This is about nonessential surgeries using PPE [personal protective equipment] during this pandemic.”

Women’s Med Center of Dayton also refused to comply with the order to stop abortions, reported the Dayton Daily News, adding Planned Parenthood said it is “taking steps to reduce the use of personal protective equipment and is complying with the state order because abortion is an essential, time-sensitive medical procedure.”

Abortion is essential for people’s health and wellbeing. That’s why clinic doors are staying open. https://t.co/lv55KmompW — NARAL (@NARAL) March 22, 2020

Pro-life organizations that have long documented the unsanitary conditions at abortion clinics, however, fear “steps to reduce the use” of PPE during abortions will further compromise the safety of women and cause the continued spread of the coronavirus.

In a statement sent to Breitbart News, Catherine Glenn Foster, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, said:

COVID-19 and the national crisis it has prompted remind us of so many truths the abortion lobby would rather we forget. Abortion companies always put their profits over their patients’ health. Abortion clinics are dirty and dangerous. Abortion is violence, not healthcare. The sheer selfishness on display by abortionists refusing to close shop even for a brief time to funnel every possible resource to the brave medical providers on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus – not to mention putting women at greater risk – is simply unconscionable.

Operation Rescue also noted that abortion facilities that are “not known for adhering to infection control protocols even in normal times — are staying open despite the very real threat of spreading the China Virus, COVID-19.”

The group’s president, Troy Newman, said:

While our schools, businesses, and churches are closed, abortion businesses are not only staying open, but are in active defiance and trying to increase the number of abortions done. For these people, today’s National Emergency is nothing more than an opportunity for profit-taking, no matter who it hurts.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has also moved to stop abortions in his state in order to make critical medical supplies available to those healthcare workers caring for victims of the coronavirus.

The order states hospitals may only perform surgeries if the patient faces an immediate risk for “serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient’s physician.”

We must work together as Texans to stop the spread of COVID-19 & ensure that our health care professionals & facilities have all the resources they need to fight the virus. Those who violate @GovAbbott's order will be met with the full force of the law.https://t.co/B5agHEh3Jq — Texas Attorney General (@TXAG) March 23, 2020

Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office confirmed Monday Abbott’s order states:

“[A]ll licensed health care professionals and all licensed health care facilities shall postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition of, or to preserve the life of, a patient who without immediate performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient’s physician.” This prohibition applies throughout the State and to all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary, including routine dermatological, ophthalmological, and dental procedures, as well as most scheduled healthcare procedures that are not immediately medically necessary such as orthopedic surgeries or any type of abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.

In a video message, Texas-based former Planned Parenthood manager-turned pro-life activist Abby Johnson urged all governors to close abortion clinics, asserting “they are providing non-essential, elective procedures and taking up precious resources that need to be used elsewhere.”

The founder and director of And Then There Were None, an organization the helps abortion workers leave their jobs, continued:

It’s not just about abortion, all elective surgeries right now should be stopped if they are using up valuable PPE. Hospitals need that protective equipment and it should be used to treat patients who have the coronavirus, not on any elective procedure. Both medical and surgical abortion require PPE. The abortion industry’s protocol, even on medication abortions, require ultrasounds, where PPE are used, and the women must have a follow up appointment to make sure the baby has passed.

Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins also called for all abortion facilities to be closed down during the coronavirus crisis and is using the hashtag #StopTheSpread to call greater attention to the need:

At a time when many areas are facing medical supply shortages and taxpayer dollars are being redirected to address the consequences of the coronavirus, we urge every governor to order abortion facilities closed in order to redirect medical personnel and supplies towards real healthcare. It makes no sense that Planned Parenthood and other abortion facilities should remain open to commit abortions, as abortion is never essential. While millions of medical professionals across the country are scrambling to find necessary supplies, we urge every governor to order abortion facilities to cease abortions and to donate their taxpayer-funded, necessary medical supplies to local hospitals and clinics that need it to provide real life-saving care.

Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said Planned Parenthood is doing the opposite of most of the country.

“Planned Parenthood is … defying lawful directives and continuing to put abortion and profits before health and safety,” she said. “In doing so, they are also contributing to deficits in our nation’s supply of personal protective equipment. In addition, through surgical and chemical abortion, they are putting women at risk for complications that will further overwhelm hospital emergency rooms during this already trying time.”"
http://www.breitbart.com/,http://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/23/photos-l-a-turns-residential-recreation-centers-into-homeless-shelters-during-coronavirus/,2020-03-23T00:00:00,Photos: L.A Turns Residential Recreation Centers into Homeless Shelters During Coronavirus,"LOS ANGELES, California — Breitbart News visited two recreation centers in Los Angeles on Monday where the homeless are being moved as part of the city’s plan to keep coronavirus from spreading among that population.

As Breitbart News reported this weekend, the city plans to move thousands of homeless people into recreation centers in residential neighborhoods. There has been little consultation with local residents, and some homeless people are worried that they may be more likely to contract coronavirus in shelters — a concern shared by some federal officials, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, reporting on similar plans elsewhere in the state.

Local residents have not been consulted about the plan — and some are deeply concerned about the possibility of coronavirus spreading from the homeless population to local residents, as well as about the possible loss of their recreational facilities.

Breitbart News obtained a letter from leaders in the upscale community of Pacific Palisades, where one recreation center is designated for use as a homeless shelter, to city officials. (The center is located next to a playground that is very popular with local families and is closed due to coronavirus.)

In the letter, they support helping the homeless, but ask pointed questions, adding: “The Palisades community needs assurances that there is a detailed plan, that it’s shared with the community, that it’s safe for all, and that it really is a temporary shelter.”

Breitbart News visited a center in Westwood, which is already operational, on Monday. Its doors were closed at 2:00 p.m., and several homeless men were waiting outside to gain entry, some resting in the sunshine.

Staff inside the center, who were wearing masks, would not allow Breitbart News to view the interior. Two officers from the Los Angeles Police Department had been assigned to watch the center, and did so from their patrol car. They told Breitbart News that they would not prevent anyone from leaving the center if they wanted to do so.

At about 2:00, a shuttle bus pulled up near the entrance, with signs in the windows reading “SHELTER.”

One driver told Breitbart News that the bus drives around the neighborhood, looking for homeless people. It asks them a series of screening questions, and checks their temperatures, then takes them to the facility, where they are assigned a cot.

One man, Ray Ortiz, told Breitbart News that he was frustrated at having to wait for the shelter to open. He had been moved from the nearby shelter at the West Los Angeles Armory, and had originally been picked up from the Venice neighborhood, where he had been sleeping on the beach. He claimed to be an electrician by trade, and to have come to L.A. from Arizona “to work, and to surf.” He said he would feel safer from coronavirus in the shelter.

Breitbart News also viewed another location, at Cheviot Hills, which is next to outdoor recreation facilities that are still in use by local residents during the “shelter at home” order. Children were among those present nearby.

Inside the building, Breitbart News observed hand sanitizer dispensers, and staff working within a gymnasium that had cots set up inside it. Staff onsite, who work for the City of Los Angeles, would not permit any photographs.

Advocates for the homeless are divided about the use of recreation centers. Some who spoke to Breitbart News suggested it may be a temporary measure, on the way to a more permanent effort to relocate and treat the homeless.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said President Donald Trump’s plan for the country to return to regular business activity soon was motivated by his and Vice President Mike Pence’s stock portfolios.

Anchor Ari Melber said, “Any reaction to what we heard out of the press conference here, and specifically Donald Trump already sort of trying to tout the idea that we have a return to normalcy soon?”

Gillibrand said, “Well, the president isn’t making any sense. And in fact, we have a major health crisis in front of us. I’ve talked to almost every hospital in New York State, and they’re still worried about getting basic personal protective equipment, getting more masks, getting more gowns, getting more ventilation machines. This is a huge crisis. And for him to downplay it because he’s worried about stock prices or his own economy, it’s shocking. It’s a lack of leadership. And so what Congress is working on right now is how do we support our small businesses, how do we support employees who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, how do we make sure people can have sick leaves and paid leave days, how do we make sure that those who cannot be working because their children are home and the schools are closed, how can they still keep putting food on the table? Everybody has a purpose right now, and our purpose as individuals is to stay at home, to keep our families safe, to make sure we don’t transmit a virus more than it needs to be transmitted. Every time you choose to stay at home and not go look at the cherry blossoms or not go to the beach, you’re making a choice to not transmit this virus and keep more people safe. That is the right choice, and we all have a duty to do that.”

She added, “We have people in the senate whose husbands are sick on oxygen right now because of the coronavirus. I’ve talked to the families across New York whose children, whose parents are sick with the coronavirus. This is a real epidemic. For the president, for the vice president to downplay this because of their stock portfolios is shocking and really antithetical to the moment we’re in. That’s why Congress is working hard to try to meet the needs of the American people because the president and his administration certainly aren’t.”

Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday night that the UK would go into enforced lockdown after reports of people ignoring the scientific advice to self-isolate to stop the spread of coronavirus.

The measures mean that more than two people who do not live together will not be able to congregate; Britons will only be allowed to leave the house for essential shopping and one form of exercise a day like going for a walk; and shops selling non-essential goods will close. These measures will be in place for at least three weeks and the police have to power to enforce the rules if people do not follow them.

After Mr Johnson made the statement, Mr Farage reacted by saying: “So we are to be locked down — and a new testing regime will begin. Will the planes keep coming from Milan, Tehran, and Beijing? I expect so. It’s all too late.”

Speaking earlier in the day, the Brexiteer criticised the government’s lack of “joined-up thinking” and for failing to learn the lessons of Italy, the viral epicentre for Europe.

Mr Farage said: “On the very same day that Lombardy was closed down, 17 flights came into the United Kingdom from Milan’s Malpensa airport…. [with] not a single person being temperature checked.”

“We hear this remarkable story coming from France that the reason Boris finally shut down pubs and restaurants is that President Macron said that if he didn’t do it France would effectively put a blockade on us,” he continued, condemning the Tories for showing a lack of leadership.

“This is not a country where people obey government orders unless they respect the government and the actions that it’s taking. I want to pose this question: If we’re told… that we have to lock down, how can we respect that when just yesterday aeroplanes were still coming in from Beijing, Tehran, from Milan? And people are being told they should ‘self-isolate’.” he added.

The Brexit Party leader was not the only figure critical of Johnson’s announcement with author, journalist, and broadcaster Peter Hitchens calling the plans “ridiculous and sinister”.

“This action by Alexander [Boris] Johnson is simultaneously ridiculous and sinister. I do hope that all those who sneered when I expressed concern about a coming attack on liberty will now see what it was I meant,” Mr Hitchens wrote.

“I’m partly mocking Alexander Johnson’s ridiculous, sinister government because I’m worried that tomorrow night he’ll come on TV to tell me I am not allowed to mock the government. Unthinkable you say? How unthinkable was national house arrest a week ago?” he added."

Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence tested negative on Saturday.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) became the first U.S. senator over the weekend to confirm he had contracted the coronavirus. In a statement Monday, Paul explained he swiftly obtained a virus test due to previously having a portion of his lung removed because of damage he sustained during his 2017 assault by a neighbor.

“I believe we need more testing immediately, even among those without symptoms. The nature of COVID-19 put me – and us all – in a Catch-22 situation. I didn’t fit the criteria for testing or quarantine. I had no symptoms and no specific encounter with a COVID-19 positive person,” Paul said in a statement. “I had, however, traveled extensively in the U.S. and was required to continue doing so to vote in the Senate. That, together with the fact that I have a compromised lung, led me to seek testing.”"

CNN’s Annie Grayer, citing reporting from her colleague Ted Barrett, said Sanders accused a reporter — who asked about his absence from Sunday’s vote — of standing too close to him.

“Stay away from me. There’s CDC requirement. Please follow it,” Sanders reportedly said.

In a second tweet, Garyer quoted Sanders, who did not explain his absence from Sunday’s vote as originally asked. Sanders said:

Right now the most important thing that anybody can do, and that the progressive movement can do, is to make sure that working people get the protection that they need. I’m going to use every tool that I have to make sure that that happened.

His remarks follow 24-hours of congressional chaos, with Democrats blocking a bipartisan bill to provide economic relief to Americans and, under the leadership of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), presenting their own partisan bill filled with progressive policy items unrelated to the crisis at hand.

Those “liberal wish list” items include requirements for federal and corporate gender and racial diversity data, a bailout for the U.S. Postal Service, and increased fuel emission standards for airlines receiving funds and carbon offsets.

Sanders on Sunday opted to hold a virtual roundtable discussion with Reps.

The updated figures come as New York, the state with the most cases, announced that it saw a 38 percent increase of infections overnight, bringing its total number to 20,875. New York City accounts for 12,305 of them. In response, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) issued an emergency order Monday directing hospitals to increase their capacity by 50 percent.

“I think it’s unreasonable to tell hospitals to double their capacity,” the governor said during his daily press briefing on the virus. “They must increase by 50 percent at least.”

In an effort to combat the illness, New York will launch clinical trials Tuesday of the ant-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine amid testimonies that it is a potential treatment.

Rapper Cardi B was in a relatively restrained mood, telling her Instagram followers in a new post to “stay safe” and to “remember to drink lots of hot liquids and avoid foods that will give you mucus” — though the accompanying video appears to show her freaking out a little over technical problems during a live stream.

Michael Rapaport recorded a typically profane video, this time berating parents who have let their children continue to flout government guidelines regarding social distancing and self-quarantining.

Actress Glenn Close provided a dispatch from her rural isolation, telling her Instagram followers that her down time is making her feel “incredibly creative.”

Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche recorded a humorous video in a cartoonish French dialect in which she recommended that her fans catch her latest movie on cable.

In an interview with Fox Nation, Caviezel gave a two-word update when asked about Gibson’s progress — that the script is on its “fifth draft.”

“It’s going to be a masterpiece,” he continued. “It’s gonna be the biggest film in world history, I believe it will be based on what I feel in my heart.”

He said that some of the things that occurred while filming the 2004 movie made the scene of Jesus walking through the streets of Jerusalem’s Old City far more meaningful than it might otherwise have been.

During the scene, Caviezel was carrying a heavy wooden cross through the streets, as Jesus did heading toward the site of his crucifixion. But at one point, he stumbled and dropped the cross, causing it to come crashing down onto his shoulders.

“As I went down, the cross… it actually struck my head and buried my head in the sand. And I bit through my tongue,” the Person of Interest star said. “Now, in the tape, you’ll see streams of blood coming down from my lip. That’s actually my own blood.”

Caviezel added that the pain he experienced was far too real. But he worked on and continued filming the scene. And when he went to deliver his lines to Virgin Mary actress Maia Morgenstern, the pain added a level of realism.

“At this time, the shoulder is out, and I was trying everything I had to get my arm over [the cross],” Caviezel added, “And it looks like it’s the most extraordinary take because it looks like I’m cherishing our cross, which is our faith, and hugging it but in the most beautiful way.

“It wasn’t beautiful to me,” he joked, “because it hurt like hell. …my AC joint had been torn.”

Caviezel also noted that he was seriously injured during the scourging scene, where he received a 14-inch gash on his back. But the experiences brought an amount of reality to the movie that made it a better work of art.

“A lot of these mistakes were occurring, but it was making something much more beautiful that will last forever,” he said of the film.

Caviezel also said that the film would stand the test of time, just like the Bible itself.

“I think it’s like the Bible. People are going to keep reading it. They’ve been reading it for thousands of years,” Caviezel exclaimed. “I think that Mel Gibson and I did very clearly stick to that and not much has changed in 2000 years. Jesus is as controversial now that he’s ever been.”

Caviezel concluded by insisting that Biblical films are discounted by today’s movie studios.

“The films they make are Marvel Comics movies. You’ll see Superman. You won’t see Jesus… I got to play the greatest superhero there ever was,” he said.

Davi posted a series of videos to Twitter Monday saying that Pelosi and others he described as “Marxists” are using the crisis as an opportunity to push a socialist plan on the American people. “Every plan that the Democrats have is corrupt,” the License to Kill actor said. “What they want is what Bernie Sanders wants, which is a revolution… They’re using this to collapse the nation.”

Pelosi has been a key force blocking the passage of a $1.6 trillion Congressional stimulus package that would provide much-needed relief to Americans as the global coronavirus pandemic continues to threaten the U.S. economy.

Davi said in his Twitter video that private businesses form the backbone of the U.S. economy. “Unless there are businesses there are no workers of the world,” he said. “The left will take your freedoms away from you. The left is dangerous.”

The conservative Hollywood actor also cautioned people not to trust the mainstream media. “They’re not telling you what’s going on,” he said, adding later: “We’re in a crisis point. We have to work together. We can beat this.”

“Our world has been taking a kicking. We’ve damaged our world and, you know, it’s no surprise that our world is reacting to the human race,” the British actor said.

Idris Elba spoke remotely to Oprah Winfrey as part of her new Apple TV+ series Oprah Talks: COVID-19. In the interview, Elba compared mankind to an infection, with the coronavirus as the Earth’s attempt to rid itself of that malady.

“There’s no surprise that a virus has been created that is going to slow us down and ultimately make us think differently about our world and ourselves,” the Luther star said. “That’s like for me, that’s a standout thing that’s very obvious. This is almost like the world’s cry out to like, ‘hey hey hey, you’re kicking me, and what you’re doing is not good. So I’ll get rid of you,’ as any organism would do is try and get rid of an infection and maybe this is it for the world.”

Winfrey concurred with the actor’s insight into the coronavirus.

“I think we all lose as human beings if we just think of this as a physical virus,” Winfrey said. “I think it’s exactly what you just said. That it’s here to teach us, show us something about ourselves as individuals and also as a world of people. And this is a moment for our humanity to either rise or not.”

Idris Elba revealed last week that he has coronavirus, but said that he had no symptoms. “Stay home people and be pragmatic,” he said. The actor’s wife, Sabrina Dhowre Elba, revealed her own diagnosis on Winfrey’s Apple TV+ show.

Celebrities including Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson; Daniel Dae Kim; Debi Mazar; Olga Kurylenko; and Placido Domingo have said that they contracted the coronavirus.

Panic in Year Zero! hails from Roger Corman’s American International Pictures (AIP), one of Hollywood’s most famous and profitable independent production companies. Between 1954 and 1980, AIP released hundreds of cheapies with titles like Shake, Rattle, and Rock!, The Amazing Transparent Man, and Samson and the Seven Miracles of the World.

AIP’s gameplan was a simple one… Jump on whatever trend the teens were into, do it fast, do it cheap.

Beach movies, horror movies, biker movies, blacksploitation, women in prison… In 1970 alone, AIP released 14 titles, and they were all crap. But every once in a while, like the proverbial billion monkeys hammering away at a billion typewriters, a gem would appear: Coffy (1973), Sisters (1973), Dementia 13 (1963), Little Shop of Horrors (1960), and a number of Edgar Allen Poe classics starring Vincent Price, most especially Pit and the Pendulum (1961) and Masque of the Red Death (1964) — which is probably the most original plague movie ever made.

At the risk of getting too far off track, and although it ended up being release by Paramount, AIP also produced one legitimate masterpiece, Peter Bogdonovich’s Targets (1968)

Although it’s no masterpiece, Panic in Year Zero! is a true gem that examines the after-effects of a worldwide nuclear war on a single American family.

Shot in a matter of weeks and directed by its star, 1945’s Best Actor Oscar winner Ray Milland (The Lost Weekend), Panic wastes no time getting to the nitty gritty. It’s just after dawn, and Harry (Milland) stands outside his Los Angeles suburban home staring at a fishing rod. The camper is all hooked up. He’s just waiting for his wife Ann (Jean Hagen) and teen-aged kids Rick (Frankie Avalon) and Karen (Mary Mitchell) to stop whining about the early hour so he can get going.

Just outside of Los Angeles, there’s a bright light. Then another. Then another. At first they assume it’s lightning. But the mushroom cloud over the city they once called home tells the full truth.

Now what?

I’m not going to spoil the rest of the plot. Suffice to say, it is a tense and tightly-wound 93 minutes. That, however, is not the reason I’m recommending it.

What I love about Panic is how instructive and unique it is.

Here’s a family out in the middle of nowhere, lucky to be alive, and now they have to survive in a world they no longer recognize, a world filled with desperate people, price gougers, and marauders looking to take your food, your weapons, your daughter, and your life.

I might have missed it, but I don’t recall the movie ever telling us how Harry made his living. One assumes he’s a businessman of some sort, we’re certainly introduced to a Ward Cleaver-type, but almost immediately he turns into someone else, someone his wife does not recognize — a survivor.

There’s no scope to Panic in Year Zero! What I mean is that we never see the destruction of L.A., we never even see a television newscast or crowd scene filled with terrified people. The focus here is only on this family and what they must do to survive in a rural California filled with small towns and terrified citizens looking to escape along rural roads.

Most apocalyptic movies focus on Big Ideas about humanity, world politics, or even finding a cure. We’re almost always at the center of the action in the White House, with the military, with the scientists, with the problem solvers, with the Last Man on Earth and his quest for a vaccine, or with the small group of survivors waging war against the invaders, be they from space of Russia.

Panic is only about one thing — what this family must do to survive…

What’s most fascinating is that our protagonist, Harry, isn’t interested in teaching his children any lessons about generosity, rebuilding civilization, world peace, or lending your neighbor a helping hand. Not now. Not in a world gone feral. And while his wife questions his sudden lack of charity and distrust towards anyone outside the family, Harry cares only about one thing — keeping his family alive and safe…

The first thing they need is food. Thinking ahead of the panicked mob that will pick everything clean in seconds, Harry goes off road towards a small town and finds exactly what he’s looking for: a shopkeeper who has not yet heard of the nuclear attack and is thrilled to open early for a $200 sale.

Harry piles his camper with months worth of food and walks over to the hardware store, where he buys firearms, ammunition, fishing poles, lanterns, rope, shovels… $400 worth. But he only has $200. He offers the owner a check for the rest. When the owner refuses, Harry becomes an armed robber.

Later, Harry will punch out a price gouging gas station owner (but leave a sawbuck, which is what the gas should have cost), and then cause a devastating multi-car accident so he can get his family across a highway, a highway that never stops.

Harry has one goal and one goal only: keep his family alive.

Harry has one duty and one duty only: keep his family alive.

He hands his son a shotgun, tears down literal bridges behind him (to keep his family isolated as they wait it out), teaches his family to hunt, to hide their supplies, and when asked for food from a decent man, even one can, he refuses.

Harry’s only regret ends up being a moment of weakness. Yes, when he had the drop on them, he should have shot down those three marauders in cold blood.

There is only one moral in Panic in Year Zero!: protect your family at all costs.

There is only one cause here: protect your family at all costs.

Any duty Harry felt towards his country, his fellow man, his community or the law, is immediately abandoned.

On top of that, Panic in Year Zero! schools us in survival; it’s a step-by-step tutorial in how to prioritize what you’ll need, how to scavenge it, how to protect it, where to hide, and how to hold out one once you’re there.

You never let your guard down.

You never trust anyone.

Your responsibility is not to the world. This is no time to virtue signal. Your responsibility is only to your family — even if they will never look at you in the same way again.

One reviewer summed things up nicely in this way:

Panic In Year Zero! scrupulously avoids scenes requiring more than minimalist production values yet still delivers on its promise, allowing audience imagination to expand upon the narrow scope of what’s actually on the screen. It sure seemed shocking in 1962, and easily trumped other more pacifistic efforts. The Day the Earth Caught Fire was for budding flower people; Panic In Year Zero! could have been made as a sales booster for the gun industry.

Not long after I first saw Panic, my wife and I were headed home to North Carolina after spending New Year’s with our family in Wisconsin. By the time we reached Kentucky, we were caught in the middle of the worst snowstorm in decades. It was so bad, state troopers stopped traffic and told us we had a half hour to get off the freeway.

Obviously, we had to find a hotel.

At the next exit there were hotels, plenty of them, but everyone was taking that exit. There was line of headlights straight to the lobby doors.

This is when I remembered Panic in Year Zero!, the tip about not going where everyone else is going… If I wasted my 30 minutes sitting in that exit, what were the chances there would be any rooms left, and then my 30 minutes would be up.

So I spent those 30 minutes driving (about 20 miles per hour) to the next exit with a hotel … and we got the last room available at a Howard Johnson’s.

We unloaded. I walked a few of blocks through the snowpocalyose to a Mexican restaurant that was 15 minutes from closing, and instead of sleeping in our car, we enjoyed a cozy night of good food and a good movie.

Thank you, Ray Milland!

Shot in a matter of weeks and directed by its star, 1945’s Best Actor Oscar winner Ray Milland (The Lost Weekend), Panic wastes no time getting to the nitty gritty. It’s just after dawn, and Harry (Milland) stands outside his Los Angeles suburban home staring at a fishing rod. The camper is all hooked up. He’s just waiting for his wife Ann (Jean Hagen) and teen-aged kids Rick (Frankie Avalon) and Karen (Mary Mitchell) to stop whining about the early hour so he can get going.

Just outside of Los Angeles, there’s a bright light. Then another. Then another. At first they assume it’s lightning. But the mushroom cloud over the city they once called home tells the full truth.

Now what?

I’m not going to spoil the rest of the plot. Suffice to say, it is a tense and tightly-wound 93 minutes. That, however, is not the reason I’m recommending it.

What I love about Panic is how instructive and unique it is.

Here’s a family out in the middle of nowhere, lucky to be alive, and now they have to survive in a world they no longer recognize, a world filled with desperate people, price gougers, and marauders looking to take your food, your weapons, your daughter, and your life.

I might have missed it, but I don’t recall the movie ever telling us how Harry made his living. One assumes he’s a businessman of some sort, we’re certainly introduced to a Ward Cleaver-type, but almost immediately he turns into someone else, someone his wife does not recognize — a survivor.

There’s no scope to Panic in Year Zero! What I mean is that we never see the destruction of L.A., we never even see a television newscast or crowd scene filled with terrified people. The focus here is only on this family and what they must do to survive in a rural California filled with small towns and terrified citizens looking to escape along rural roads.

Most apocalyptic movies focus on Big Ideas about humanity, world politics, or even finding a cure. We’re almost always at the center of the action in the White House, with the military, with the scientists, with the problem solvers, with the Last Man on Earth and his quest for a vaccine, or with the small group of survivors waging war against the invaders, be they from space of Russia.

Panic is only about one thing — what this family must do to survive…

What’s most fascinating is that our protagonist, Harry, isn’t interested in teaching his children any lessons about generosity, rebuilding civilization, world peace, or lending your neighbor a helping hand. Not now. Not in a world gone feral. And while his wife questions his sudden lack of charity and distrust towards anyone outside the family, Harry cares only about one thing — keeping his family alive and safe…

The first thing they need is food. Thinking ahead of the panicked mob that will pick everything clean in seconds, Harry goes off road towards a small town and finds exactly what he’s looking for: a shopkeeper who has not yet heard of the nuclear attack and is thrilled to open early for a $200 sale.

Harry piles his camper with months worth of food and walks over to the hardware store, where he buys firearms, ammunition, fishing poles, lanterns, rope, shovels… $400 worth. But he only has $200. He offers the owner a check for the rest. When the owner refuses, Harry becomes an armed robber.

Later, Harry will punch out a price gouging gas station owner (but leave a sawbuck, which is what the gas should have cost), and then cause a devastating multi-car accident so he can get his family across a highway, a highway that never stops.

Harry has one goal and one goal only: keep his family alive.

Harry has one duty and one duty only: keep his family alive.

He hands his son a shotgun, tears down literal bridges behind him (to keep his family isolated as they wait it out), teaches his family to hunt, to hide their supplies, and when asked for food from a decent man, even one can, he refuses.

Harry’s only regret ends up being a moment of weakness. Yes, when he had the drop on them, he should have shot down those three marauders in cold blood.

There is only one moral in Panic in Year Zero!: protect your family at all costs.

There is only one cause here: protect your family at all costs.

Any duty Harry felt towards his country, his fellow man, his community or the law, is immediately abandoned.

On top of that, Panic in Year Zero! schools us in survival; it’s a step-by-step tutorial in how to prioritize what you’ll need, how to scavenge it, how to protect it, where to hide, and how to hold out one once you’re there.

You never let your guard down.

You never trust anyone.

Your responsibility is not to the world. This is no time to virtue signal. Your responsibility is only to your family — even if they will never look at you in the same way again.

One reviewer summed things up nicely in this way:

Panic In Year Zero! scrupulously avoids scenes requiring more than minimalist production values yet still delivers on its promise, allowing audience imagination to expand upon the narrow scope of what’s actually on the screen. It sure seemed shocking in 1962, and easily trumped other more pacifistic efforts. The Day the Earth Caught Fire was for budding flower people; Panic In Year Zero! could have been made as a sales booster for the gun industry.

Not long after I first saw Panic, my wife and I were headed home to North Carolina after spending New Year’s with our family in Wisconsin. By the time we reached Kentucky, we were caught in the middle of the worst snowstorm in decades. It was so bad, state troopers stopped traffic and told us we had a half hour to get off the freeway.

Obviously, we had to find a hotel.

At the next exit there were hotels, plenty of them, but everyone was taking that exit. There was line of headlights straight to the lobby doors.

This is when I remembered Panic in Year Zero!, the tip about not going where everyone else is going… If I wasted my 30 minutes sitting in that exit, what were the chances there would be any rooms left, and then my 30 minutes would be up.

So I spent those 30 minutes driving (about 20 miles per hour) to the next exit with a hotel … and we got the last room available at a Howard Johnson’s.

We unloaded. I walked a few of blocks through the snowpocalyose to a Mexican restaurant that was 15 minutes from closing, and instead of sleeping in our car, we enjoyed a cozy night of good food and a good movie.

Thank you, Ray Milland!

“We went out with a very blunt force,” she said, referring to recent tough advice from the Centers for Disease Control guidelines. “We had to do that because we weren’t sure where the virus was and where it was going.”

Birx spoke at the White House press briefing and said that the task force learned a lot about the virus and had the necessary data to update their recommendations.

“It has to be very tailored geographically and may have to be tailored by age group, understanding who’s at the greatest risk and understanding how to protect them.”

President Donald Trump said that doctors would likely prefer a complete global shutdown to prevent the virus from spreading, but he argued that Americans could do two things at the same time.

Trump predicted updated “timelines” and “datelines” to loosen restrictions but said that “hotspots” like Washington, New York, and California would retain strict advisories.

Birx said that some states were further along than others in trying to “flatten the curve” of medical cases of the virus, and other states were not as affected.

“Each state and each hot spot in the United States is going to be its own curve ,because the seeds came in at different times,” Birx said.

Trump said that governors of certain states would have the leeway to decide for themselves what restrictions were necessary."

Marlow invited Sessions’ remarks on the connections between the coronavirus outbreak within America and the threats from “China,” “open borders,” and “globalism.”

The coronavirus pandemic illustrates the need for border security and prudent immigration policies, replied Sessions.

“First of all, borders are real,” said Session. “Borders exist to provide protection to a country, and any country should protect itself and not pretend that we don’t have borders. So the president has moved aggressively on that [in] restricting immigration, and it will be a big benefit to us.”

Sessions remarked, “We do need to continue on the president’s leadership in fixing the border, obviously that’s important. We need to understand that people don’t just get to fly all over the globe. One of our fundamentals of immigration, since time immemorial, is to avoid on disease being spread around the world.”

LISTEN:

The American Medical Association’s Journal of Ethics highlighted the centrality of preventing the spread of infectious diseases to the calibration of U.S. immigration policy across the nation’s history. The Immigration Act of 1882 excluded those deemed to be “suffering from a loathsome or a dangerous contagious disease” from eligibility for U.S. citizenship and entry to the country.

The coronavirus epidemic further reveals threats to national security rooted in American dependence on Chinese exports of medical goods, remarked Sessions.

“Whether we’re talking about the medicines we now understand about, medical equipment, ventilators, rare earth minerals, 5G, Huawei — which is now under indictment by the Department of Justice for various events — [China has] stolen our intellectual property,” Sessions stated.

“I started a China initiative at the Department of Justice that has exceeded, really, my expectations,” added Sessions. “It has just surged cases,” noting that federal indictments against Chinese nationals and organization related to national security threats are “ongoing.”

Sessions contrasted the Justice Department’s emphasis of threats from China during his tenure as attorney general with that of his predecessors during the Obama administration.

“One report said there were zero cases under the last four years of the Obama administration,” said Sessions of the Justice Department’s investigations of suspected China-related crimes. “There are now 50 cases involving Chinese entities ongoing. We called it the China initiative. There are now as many as 1,000 investigations. FBI Director Chris Ray said each one of his 56 field offices have cases involving Chinese entities.”

Sessions continued, “They cannot cheat us any longer. They cannot defraud us any longer. We cannot allow China — Huawei — to supply our 5G Internet high-speed Internet connectivity. We cannot allow that to happen. They cannot continue to provide our medicines. They’ve threatened to cut that off. And there are just other things that we are hooked to them on that they have got to stop.

China procures American businesses as political assets and leverage against the U.S. through the establishment financial relationships, noted Sessions.

“It’s highly sophisticated,” said Sessions of China’s geopolitical strategy. “Individual businesses, first, are basically corrupted. If you want to do business in China, you have to go along with their demands. Mercedes has a big Alabama plant [and] they want to sell their cars in China. They were told recently, ‘You can’t sell them here unless you buy your batteries from China.’ They didn’t want to do that, but that was the deal they had to agree to. That kind of thing has been going on for years, [but] we don’t do it to Chinese companies.”

China is more dependent on America’s market than the other way around, assessed Sessions.

“We’ve got to say, ‘If you want to play in our league, you’ve got to play by the rules, China,’” Sessions stated. “What the president knows … is that China must have our market, [and] that their economy would be in shambles if they can’t sell their three, four, five hundred billion dollar surplus to the United States.”

Sessions went on, “We have much more leverage than they do, and it’s time for us to use it,” adding, “if we do that effectively, there’ll be some pushback from certain special interest groups.”

Reelecting Trump is critical to protecting and restoring American sovereignty, determined Sessions.

Sessions concluded, “We have perhaps one opportunity, now. That’s with the reelection of President Trump to get this done. There are powerful forces out there — globalist forces, big business forces, left-wing Democratic forces, La Raza-type radical forces — that are working against ending the lawlessness [on the southern border]

Session ended with remarks on his recusal from any Justice Department investigations of Trump’s 2016 president campaign during his tenure as attorney general.

“I was a part of the Trump campaign,” Sessions recalled. “The investigation was investigating the campaign, and I was a witness. … There was a specific regulation in the [Department of Justice] that said that if you are part of a campaign, you can’t investigate the campaign.”

Sessions described his recusal as a measure to “create discipline and order” in the Department of Justice, and to end what he described as partisan politicization of the Justice Department by his predecessors during the Obama administration.

“The attorney general has to follow the rules, too,” Sessions concluded, “You can’t just not follow the rules and I felt that’s what I was obligated to do,” adding, “It was a long and difficult and frustrating thing for the president, but … I felt that I did what I had to do.”

“They’re continuing to hold up emergency measures over tax credits for solar panels, tax credits for solar panels,” McConnell said.

McConnell said, “Tax credits for solar energy and wind energy, provisions for employees to give special and new treatment to big labor? And listen to this, new emissions standards for the airlines. Are you kidding me? This is the moment to debate new regulations that have nothing whatsoever to do with this crisis?”

He continued, “I’d like to see Democrats tell New York City doctors and nurses, who are literally overrun, that they are filibustering hospital funding and more masks because they want to argue with the airlines over their carbon footprint?”

Democrats blocked a coronavirus package on Sunday that would have provided immediate economic relief to American workers and businesses suffering from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

“Eleventh-hour demands Democrats have decided are more important than Americans’ paychecks and the personal safety of doctors and nurses,” McConnell added.

The Senate Majority Leader noted that many Democrats told him privately that they were embarrassed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) decision to block the coronavirus bill.

McConnell said that Democrats “ought to be embarrassed, Mr. President. In fact, I’ve heard from some who are embarrassed, talking like this is not some juicy political opportunity.”

“This is a national emergency,” he added.

“I’d like to see Senate Democrats tell seniors who have seen their hard-earned retirement savings literally melt away as the markets track toward their worst month since 1931,” McConnell said."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 3 percent. Earlier it was down by as much as 5 percent and at one point lost all its gains since the election of Donald Trump in 2016. The S&P 500 fell 2.93 percent. The Nasdaq Composite slid by a milder 0.27 percent.

All three indexes closed well above their lows of the day.

Stocks dropped in early trading Monday after Capitol Hill Democrats pushed back against the economic rescue package proposed by Republican lawmakers and supported by the Trump White House. They recovered some of those losses in the early afternoon until Democrats once again blocked progress on the Senate bill by voting against a procedural measure.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 3 percent. Earlier it was down by as much as 5 percent and at one point lost all its gains since the election of Donald Trump in 2016. The S&P 500 fell 2.93 percent. The Nasdaq Composite slid by a milder 0.27 percent.

All three indexes closed well above their lows of the day.

Stocks dropped in early trading Monday after Capitol Hill Democrats pushed back against the economic rescue package proposed by Republican lawmakers and supported by the Trump White House. They recovered some of those losses in the early afternoon until Democrats once again blocked progress on the Senate bill by voting against a procedural measure.

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) announced Monday that her husband, John Bessler, has tested positive for coronavirus.

Klobuchar announced the news in a tweet, saying she “will do all I can to get help to the American people.”

“My husband has coronavirus,” Klobuchar wrote. “I love him & not being able to be by his side is one of the hardest things about this disease.”

My husband has coronavirus. I love him & not being able to be by his side is one of the hardest things about this disease. So many are going through this & much worse.

“So many are going through this & much worse,” she added. “I pray for him & you & meanwhile I will do all I can to get help to the American people.”

Klobuchar further explained her husband’s scenario in a statement and said he is being treated at a Virginia hospital.

“While I cannot see him and he is of course cut off from all visitors, our daughter Abigail and I are constantly calling and texting and emailing,” Klobuchar said. “We love him very much and pray for his recovery.”

Klobuchar described her husband as “exhausted and sick but a very strong and resilient person” and stated he “kept having a temperature and a bad, bad, cough,” which lead to him getting tested.

“When he started coughing up blood, he got a test and a chest X-ray and they checked him into a hospital in Virginia because of a variety of things including very low oxygen levels which haven’t really improved,” Klobuchar explained. “He now has pneumonia and is on oxygen but not a ventilator.”

Klobuchar also said she and her husband have “been in different places for the last two weeks” and that she is “outside the 14-day period for getting sick.”

“As everyone is aware, there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere and I don’t qualify to get one under any standard,” Klobuchar added. “I love my husband so very much and not being able to be there at the hospital by his side is one of the hardest things about this disease.”

“I hope he will be home soon,” Klobuchar concluded. “I know so many Americans are going through this and so much worse right now. So I hope and pray for you, just as I hope you will do for my husband. Meanwhile I am working in the Senate to get help to the American people.”"

The Los Angeles Times reports:

More California counties are releasing inmates to protect their jails againstpossible coronavirus outbreaks. In Alameda County, officials announced 247 people were being released from the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin. San Diego County officials have announced similar moves, as have San Francisco, San Mateo and other counties. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has reduced its inmate population by 6% in the last three weeks and Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey said her office would consider reducing bail for thousands of nonviolent offenders.

There were no confirmed coronavirus cases inside L.A. County jails as of Thursday, the Times notes.

But on Friday, the city began implementing a plan to move thousands of homeless people into temporary shelters inside recreational buildings in residential areas.

The plan is opposed even by some homeless people, who fear they will be more susceptible to coronavirus inside shelters — even with beds 6 feet apart — than in the open.

Officials are struggling to prevent a coronavirus outbreak among homeless people who a live in crowded makeshift encampments alongside streets and in vacant lots. They are also trying to create space for “social distancing” inside existing homeless shelters by relocating residents.

Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu made the announcement on Wednesday.

“Taiwan is expanding our medical cooperation with the U.S. government in the fight against the coronavirus,” Taiwan said in a statement. It went on:

Two countries will share best practices and deepen cooperation to combat the epidemic. The partnership includes research and development of rapid test, production of vaccines and medications, exchanges of medical supplies and equipment. As a responsible member of international community, Taiwan is willing to help and share our experiences in the fight against this horrible pandemic.

Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen also tweeted:

#Taiwan & the #US are expanding our cooperation to jointly develop tests, treatments, vaccines & more to better combat #COVID19. Our countries are not only partners in prosperity—we are partners through adversity & partners with integrity.

Taiwan, despite its close proximity to China — where coronavirus originated – has come off relatively unscathed. It managed to prevent community spread within its borders, so far only suffering from one death.

Wu told radio show host Hugh Hewitt last week that it was able to do so due to its experience in combating SARS.

“We learned it from our experience. Taiwan was hit very hard by SARS back in 2002 and 2003. And we learned the lesson, and therefore, we try to structure the government to deal with an epidemic like this,” he said in the March 16 interview. He added:

So when we heard that there was some suspicious cases in Wuhan, China, we jumped up ahead of what may happen to us. We started our command center. We started our taskforce in dealing with the situation. And when the situation is getting worse in China, we mobilized the whole government to deal with the situation. We try to control the border. We tried to set up quarantine mechanisms, and we tried to set up tracing mechanisms to deal with those cases, including the contacts. And the government is also issuing public messaging policies. And we also set up ration mechanisms for materials for us to face the situation. So this is what we do altogether, and so far, it’s been successful.

Wu also discussed efforts by the Communist Chinese government to deny the coronavirus started in China:

When the Coronavirus started in Wuhan, we sent our CDC officials and experts to that area to make investigation. And we knew that there was something wrong in that place. But the Chinese government officials were rather quiet about the real situation. And I think right now, the world already knows where that it started, and that is the term that we use to describe this kind of Coronavirus. We called it Wuhan Pneumonia Coronavirus, and I think that’s the way the U.S. is calling it right now. But the Chinese understand that its national reputation suffered tremendously in the last few months because of the Coronavirus. And what it’s trying to do is trying to overturn that kind of situation. … I think the Chinese are also coming out in a very strong way through its propaganda that it is the savior of the world right now — it can provide relief material, it can provide protection to the countries that are infected by the Coronavirus. So this is the situation like trying to turn black into white. And that is something that I’m sure the United States will find unacceptable. And that is something we try to ignore, whatever comes out of China. We in Taiwan need to focus on our fight against Coronavirus.

Masks are currently in short supply due to panic buying, last week the Center for Disease Control and Prevention instructed healthcare workers to use a bandana or a scarf as a makeshift mask if necessary.

Apple CEO Tim Cook announced over the weekend that Apple will be donating “millions” of masks to healthcare workers in the United States and Europe but did not clarify exactly how many Apple would be providing.

In a press briefing, Vice President Mike Pence stated that Apple will be donating two million masks to the United States. In a post to Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg stated that Facebook will be donating the masks it had left over from the California wildfires while it works on sourcing “millions more.”

Facebook did not respond to Business Insider’s request for comment on how many millions of masks the company would be donating. Tesla and SpaceX will reportedly be donating 250,000 N95 masks according to CEO Elon Musk.

In a reply to a Twitter usres on Sunday asking Musk to send more N95 masks to hospitals in Louisiana, Musk appeared to promised to do so but also criticize the N95 masks for being unwieldy, stating: “We’ll try to get & deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw [by the way]. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.”

The governor also revealed that their most recent case is a 24-year-old man who traveled to Seattle, Washington. The governor claimed that he was working with airport authorities to shut down international flights from affected areas.

According to Italy’s Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) — the leading technical-scientific body of the nation’s National Health Service — a total of 4,824 Italian healthcare workers have become infected with the Chinese coronavirus, reports La Repubblica.

This means that roughly one in ten of the people infected with the disease in Italy are the nation’s very own healthcare workers.

The report added that the Gimbe foundation — an institution based out of Bolgona, Italy, focused on improving healthcare — is requesting that coronavirus testing be extended to all Italian healthcare workers, as the foundation fears that the data is widely underestimated.

Additionally, two more Italian doctors have died on Monday, which brings the nation’s coronavirus death toll among healthcare professionals to 19, according to Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata (ANSA).

The doctors were infectious disease specialist Leonardo Marchi from Cremona — located in Italy’s worst-infected Lombardy region — and retired doctor Manfredo Squeri from Parma — located in the nation’s second-worst hit Emilia-Romagna region.

While the disease plagues all of Italy, it remains mostly concentrated in the nation’s north, as 84 percent of coronavirus-related deaths have occurred in Italy’s northern Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Piedmont regions, reports La Repubblica.

Squeri was not the only retired Italian doctor to succumb to the disease after being called on to return to the hospital to help combat the nation’s coronavirus epidemic.

Retired 73-year-old Italian doctor Gino Fasoli died from the Chinese virus last week, after returning to assist his former colleagues in trying to save the continuous arrival of coronavirus patients, according to Corriere della Sera.

Klain said:

Leading medical experts didn’t know it existed six weeks ago. So, there’s just a lot of uncertainty about the basics, uncertainty about how infectious it truly is, how much it’s going to spread, how much it’s spread already in China, how much we should expect it to spread outside of China, doubts about how lethal it is, what will the fatality rate, the rate of serious illnesses wind up being. So what I’d say is I think we have reason to be concerned. I think there’s reason for the U.S. to be more aggressive in response than what’s been mounted so far in many respects, a reason to be prepared for something. But I think no reason yet to be fearful, no reason to really panic or anything like that. I think there’s just a lot of unknowns about this virus and what its path is going to be.

On Saturday, Klain struck a much different tone and blamed the Trump administration for the response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Klain said the virus began spreading in January 2020 and “some countries acted quickly.”

Just 18 seconds into the video presentation, Klain attacked President Trump.

Klain said Trump’s “slow response” to the crisis is “no surprise,” before he pushed a conspiracy theory already debunked by Breitbart News.

It wasn’t until halfway through the video that Biden’s adviser talked about “solutions” to the crisis.

Kudlow said the Exchange Stabilization Fund will be “transparent,” shooting down the notion of it being a “slush fund,” which is what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and other Senate Democrats are referring to it as. He added that the money would get liquidity and credit into the economy.

“Senator Schumer should be able to come to an agreement on that,” Kudlow told Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom” host Ed Henry. “That’s the ESF fund that I’m talking about. So, the nub of the whole issue is to get the Federal Reserve lending and some other things, it’s not a slush fund. Look, that will get money to small and medium-sized businesses, OK? It will also get money to key parts of the economy that are distressed. There’s nothing slush about that. It’ll all be done transparently, no question about that. But we’re going to give, you know, the direct checks to the workers that’s very, very important. We’ve helped out people that have to stay at home because of the virus, that’s very, very important. We have a loan guarantee program for small businesses, it may take a little more time, but that’s very important. We’ve got direct deposit from the IRS into individual men and women, whatever it is, 3,000 bucks a family.”

He continued, “But on this so-called slush fund, they want to be very clear, this is something that is the corner, the keystone, when we get that done and it will be transparent, the treasury will run it with the Fed, it will inject liquidity. It’s probably, Ed, the fastest way to get liquidity and credit into the economy, into all these sections. I mean the Fed’s opened it up, I’m just going to read it to you: Student loans, automobile loans, credit card loans, small business loans, money market loans, corporate bonds, this is what will keep us whole while we hope and pray that the virus flattens out in the weeks ahead.”

Kudlow also voiced his disbelief Democrats blocked the bill.

“I just can’t believe that the other side of the aisle won’t help us on this. It’s beyond my head to know that they wouldn’t help us get through,” he lamented.

Want to Change Rules to Allow Remote Voting,"As the battle to legislate a coronavirus relief package to help Americans and the economy drags on in the Senate, and members are testing positive for the virus, a growing number of lawmakers are calling for a rule change to allow them to cast their vote remotely.

“I totally support the idea of remote voting so the Senate can continue to operate during this crisis. We should make this change before the Senate leaves town,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said on Twitter.

“I’m ready to support remote voting,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) tweeted. “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.”

“It is time to bring the Senate into the 21st century,” Cramer tweeted.

So far, five Republicans are or have self-isolated, including Graham and Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Cory Gardner (R-CO). That leaves the Senate majority, which usually stands at 53-45, at 48-47.

Business Insider reported on the development:

If more Senate Republicans go into quarantine, and remote voting is not permitted, this could effectively result in the GOP ceding its majority in the chamber to Democrats. But it might take some time for remote voting to occur, given changing rules in Congress can be tedious and could require a vote, among other potential challenges.

Roll Call reported on Senators taking action on the issue:

Several senators are pushing for remote voting. Ohio Republican Rob Portman and Illinois Democrat Richard J. Durbin, who collaborated on a resolution to pursue remote voting, took to the floor Sunday evening to discuss the topic after the Senate failed to advance the stimulus package. Durbin called for establishing “a verifiable technology and procedure so members do not have to be physically present.” Portman and Durbin’s resolution would give the Senate majority and minority leaders joint authority to allow secure remote voting for up to 30 days during emergency situations such as the current pandemic. Under the measure, the Senate could vote to extend the initial authority in additional 30-day increments.

Durbin said:

Five of our Senate colleagues were unable to come to the floor of the Senate and vote because they’re in self-quarantine at this moment. The numbers could grow to the point it could reach an extreme where there’s a question of an actual quorum on the floor of the Senate.

“It affects both sides of the aisle,” Portman said. “We’re all vulnerable. If we can find a practical solution which respects the integrity of the voting process of the United States Senate, let’s do it.”

Business Insider reported that almost 70 House Democrats on Monday formally requested that rules be changed so lawmakers can vote remotely if national emergencies such as the coronavirus pandemic are happening.

The lawmakers wrote in a letter to House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern:

Unfortunately, during such circumstances, requiring members to vote in person may pose public health risks or even be physically impossible for persons under quarantine. We need to provide a mechanism through which Congress can act during times of crisis without having to assemble in one place.

“There are people who want us to move forward on remote voting and there are others who have hesitation, which probably means that if you’re trying to make that kind of change, it would require votes,” McGovern told CBS News on Sunday.

Senate Democrats blocked an economic relief package negotiated by both sides — a negotiation that began to fall apart, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) intervened.

“She’s the speaker of the House, not the speaker of the Senate,” he said. “We were doing just fine until that intervention.”

Trump Jr. added further context to the initial breakdown of the deal, adding that Senate Democrats changed their minds “when they figured out that five GOP senators would not be able to vote on it because they were self quarantining.”

“Sick even by todays Democrat standards,” he added:

Those five GOP senators who are under quarantine include Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who tested positive for the virus, as well as Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Rick Scott (R-FL), and Cory Gardner (R-CO):

Both sides remain at an impasse as Democrats push a bill packed with measures unrelated to the economic relief needed during the coronavirus pandemic. Some of those proposals include same-day voter registration and a U.S. postal service bailout. They are also calling for U.S. airlines to offset their carbon emissions:

Pelosi’s proposal is reportedly 1,400 pages long:

McConnell blasted Democrats during a speech on the Senate floor on Monday. Democrats “won’t let us fund hospitals or save small businesses unless they get to dust off the Green New Deal,” he said, listing some of their demands which include “tax credits for solar energy and wind energy, provisions to force employers to give special, new treatment to big labor, and listen to this, new emissions standards for the airlines.”

“Are you kidding me? This is the moment to debate new regulations that have nothing whatsoever to do with this crisis?” he asked. “That’s what they’re up to over there.”

“The American people need to know it. Democrats won’t let us fund hospitals or save small businesses unless they get to dust off the Green New Deal,” he added.

So Democrats agreed to the bailout bill in theory but only changed their minds when they figured out that five GOP senators would not be able to vote on it because they were self quarantining. Sick even by todays Democrat standards. — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 23, 2020

Those five GOP senators who are under quarantine include Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who tested positive for the virus, as well as Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Rick Scott (R-FL), and Cory Gardner (R-CO):

Both sides remain at an impasse as Democrats push a bill packed with measures unrelated to the economic relief needed during the coronavirus pandemic. Some of those proposals include same-day voter registration and a U.S. postal service bailout. They are also calling for U.S. airlines to offset their carbon emissions:

Pelosi’s proposal is reportedly 1,400 pages long:

McConnell blasted Democrats during a speech on the Senate floor on Monday. Democrats “won’t let us fund hospitals or save small businesses unless they get to dust off the Green New Deal,” he said, listing some of their demands which include “tax credits for solar energy and wind energy, provisions to force employers to give special, new treatment to big labor, and listen to this, new emissions standards for the airlines.”

“Are you kidding me? This is the moment to debate new regulations that have nothing whatsoever to do with this crisis?” he asked. “That’s what they’re up to over there.”

“The American people need to know it. Democrats won’t let us fund hospitals or save small businesses unless they get to dust off the Green New Deal,” he added.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Monday attacked Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) after the Maine lawmaker criticized Democrats for blocking a bipartisan economic relief package.

The New York Democrat said Collins is not a “moderate lady” and cited her support for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and GOP tax cuts as proof of her assertion.

“.@SenatorCollins can keep her crocodile tears,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “She voted & fought HARD to strip pandemic prep funding. She helped drive the lack of preparation that we had leading up to this.”

“What’s actually disgraceful is her ‘I’m a Moderate Lady’ dance to cover up brutal policies and vote,” she added, listing examples in an attempt to back her point:

Collins voted for the GOP tax scam.

She voted to appoint Kavanaugh.

She’s defending an utterly corrupt bill to shower public money on friends and donors. Susan Collins is not a moderate. She just plays one on TV. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 23, 2020

Ocasio-Cortez’s attack followed Collins’ impassioned speech on the Senate floor.

“Never, never have I seen Republicans and Democrats fail to come together when confronted with a crisis,” Collins said, citing 9/11 and the financial meltdown in 2008.

“Here we are facing an enemy that is invisible but equally devastating to the health of our people and to the health of our economy. And yet, unbelievably, the Democratic leader objected to my even being able to speak this morning,” she continued.

“Is the what we’ve come to?” the senator asked.

She said both sides had been “making very good progress” and putting together a comprehensive package to “address and prevent the economic devastation that is being caused by this virus.”

“We don’t have another day. We don’t have another hour. We don’t have another minute to delay acting,” she said, detailing the small businesses in her own state impacted by the pandemic.

Together, lawmakers came up with a “very good plan” and “worked in a bipartisan way … that would help these small businesses and keep their employees paid,” Collins said.

Keep their employees getting paychecks,” she added.

“How can that possibly be controversial?” she asked. “How can any of us want to see millions of Americans lose their paychecks, their health insurance, their contributions to their retirement plans?”

“Mr. President, I cannot believe the objections to proceeding to this package,” she said, calling it “disgraceful.”

“This is disgraceful. We do not have time,” she said. “Time is not on our side. Let’s get the job done for the American people.”"

Democrats blocked the emergency package on Sunday, which fell 13 votes short of advancing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) suggested the negotiations in the Senate were “doing just fine” until House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) interfered.

As Breitbart News reported:

An angry Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) slammed Democrats for voting against the bill and blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for nixing bipartisan negotiations over a coronavirus package. “I want everybody to fully understand if we aren’t able to act tomorrow, it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address the problem,” the Senate leader said on Sunday. McConnell added that there was bipartisan consensus among “regular members of the Senate, not in the Leadership office, not in the speaker’s office for goodness sakes.” “She’s the Speaker of the House, not the Speaker of the Senate,” he added. “We were doing just fine until that intervention.”

Both sides have since reached an impasse as Pelosi and Schumer are, demonstratively, heeding the advice of Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC), who urged caucus members to view the aid package as a “tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision” during a conference call last week.

McConnell met with Schumer, Pelosi, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday. During that meeting, the House speaker reportedly “pushed a ‘laundry list’ of demands” that had little to nothing to do with economic relief needed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

Politico reported:

Pelosi pushed a “laundry list” of demands at that meeting, according to a GOP official, including a proposal to wipe off $10,000 from anyone who owns federal student loans, as well as election-security funding. The Republicans countered those issues were not germane to the stimulus debate; Democrats say they have insisted these matters needed to be discussed all along.

While Republican lawmakers are scrambling to seal a deal to provide relief to the American people, a GOP aide also told Politico that Democrats are continuing in their attempts to “add a host of unrelated measures to the coronavirus package, including expanding collective bargaining power for unions, increased fuel emission standards for airlines and more wind and solar tax credits.”"

“I think that there are a lot of people who are doing the right things, but I think that, unfortunately, we’re finding out a lot of people think this can’t happen to them,” Adams emphasized.

On March 19, 2020, Breitbart News reported National Shooting Sports Foundation numbers showing gun sales in the U.S. had jumped 300 percent above where they were at the same point in time last year. Thereafter, various Federal Firearm License holders (FFLs) contacted Breitbart News to talk of calling into the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Checks (NICS) to do a background check for a pending sale, only to be placed on hold for hours and/or, in some cases, to have the line disconnected.

An FFL from a western state told Breitbart News he has a stack of background checks forms–ATF form 4473–already filled out by customers who came into the store to purchase firearms during the sales surge. The FFL arrives at store early in the morning and places a call to the FBI NICS number simply to be placed in the queue, and once he is talking to someone he runs as many of the background checks as he can before being disconnected.

An FFL in a midwestern state told Breitbart News he lost “$10,000 to “$12,000” in sales on Friday, March 20, 2020, due to delays in NICS response to phone calls for background checks.

An FFL in a southern state told a similar story after having so many struggles with NICS that he thought the background check system had simply been shut down.

The Scranton Times-Tribune reports a similar story on the state-level background check system in Pennsylvania. They noted that on March 18, 2020, “The state police announced the computer system that conducts background checks on firearms purchases, which is called the Pennsylvania Instant Check System, crashed twice in one day.”

This failure came as gun transactions on March 19, 2020, jumped over 300 percent higher than they were on March 19, 2019.

Pennsylvania State Police Bureau of Records and Identification’s Maj. Gary Dance stressed the crashing of the state’s background check system was not due to an intentional state response to the coronavirus. Rather, the system was just overwhelmed.

Thereafter, various Federal Firearm License holders (FFLs) contacted Breitbart News to talk of calling into the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Checks (NICS) to do a background check for a pending sale, only to be placed on hold for hours and/or, in some cases, to have the line disconnected.

Mitt Romney (R-UT) is accusing Democrats who blocked the Senate coronavirus stimulus bill of putting America on a path to “social destruction.”

In a pair of tweets published late Sunday night, Romney exploded at Democrats who, after spending the weekend negotiating a compromise bill that was on the verge of passing with a bipartisan vote, appeared to change their minds after Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi threw a partisan bomb into the chamber.

There is even talk that after five Republican senators were forced to go into quarantine, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saw this as an opportunity to gain the upper hand. If that’s the case, the word “cynicism” doesn’t begin to describe what just happened — and what just happened is that a bill that was meant to stabilize our economy and provide immediate relief to American workers and the companies that employ them was sabotaged for partisan reasons at the last minute.

And Romney, who is one of the senators forced into quarantine, is not only furious; he’s sounding the alarm at the potential damage this could cause.

“Nothing in the Senate has shocked me, until today,” Romney tweeted. “Standing in the way of a critically needed rescue package is irresponsible and reckless. Dems say not enough money to states: nearly $200 billion isn’t chump change. Hospitals get at least $75 billion.”

“As for funds for companies, it’s to keep entities that employ millions of Americans from folding—it’s to save jobs,” he added in a second tweet. “Keep this up a little longer and we will go from social distancing to social destruction”:

As for funds for companies, it’s to keep entities that employ millions of Americans from folding—it’s to save jobs. Keep this up a little longer and we will go from social distancing to social destruction. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) March 23, 2020

This is Mitt Romney saying this… This is the same Mitt Romney who seeks every opportunity to embarrass President Trump and cozy up to Democrats and the corporate media who protect them.

And he’s not the only squishy Republican who’s justifiably furious. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), also no fan of the president, took to the Senate floor Monday morning to rip Democrats.

Fox News’s Chad Pergram reported in real time “Collins lighting into Dems now. Says ‘the answer from my Democratic colleagues is delay, delay, delay.'”

“As angry as she’s ever been on the Senate floor,” he added.

The fake news media frequently hold Pelosi up as some sort of political genius. I’ve never really bought that, and I think the disaster that was impeachment only backs up my criticism. But this… This! What in the world did Pelosi think she was doing?

We are in a situation where our economy is barreling towards a cliff, a situation where every day counts, and Pelosi pulled the football away at the very last minute…

All that time and effort wasted. All those precious days wasted on negotiations and agreement between the two parties, just so Queen Nancy could swoop in at the last minute to hurl her partisan grenades and announce that Queen Pelosi Will Write Her Own Bill.

How long is that going to take?

Pelosi is a multimillionaire. She can afford a shutdown. The rest of us are watching our retirement accounts melt away as our bank accounts dwindle because the same government that shut down our economy is not making us whole again because Queen Nancy feels like playing a fiddle to pervert a rescue bill into the Green New Deal. No, really… That’s what she wants to do.

For once, I agree with Romney… Nothing in the Senate has shocked me, until today,” he said, and as cynical as I can be, never in a million years did I expect Democrats to screw the country with a kamikaze stunt like this one.

Oh, and from his luxury bunker, Joe Biden supports Pelosi blocking this relief for Americans. FYI.

Rand Paul (R-KY) on Monday explained he was able to quickly obtain a coronavirus test due to previously having a portion of his lung removed and asked for compassion amid criticism that he did not engage in social distancing before learning that he contracted the illness.

“I believe we need more testing immediately, even among those without symptoms. The nature of COVID-19 put me – and us all – in a Catch-22 situation. I didn’t fit the criteria for testing or quarantine. I had no symptoms and no specific encounter with a COVID-19 positive person,” Paul said in a statement. “I had, however, traveled extensively in the U.S. and was required to continue doing so to vote in the Senate. That, together with the fact that I have a compromised lung, led me to seek testing.”

Paul revealed in August that he had undergone surgery to remove a part of his lung damaged during his 2017 assault by a neighbor.

Paul noted that despite the diagnosis, he remains asymptotic of the illness that has infected over 40,000 people and killed 479 in the United States. He then pushed back on criticism of his decision to undergo testing, arguing that had he not sought out a test, he may have still been interacting with others on Capitol Hill, putting them at risk of infection.

“For those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine, realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a tee, I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol. The current guidelines would not have called for me to get tested nor quarantined. It was my extra precaution, out of concern for my damaged lung, that led me to get tested,” Paul said. “Perhaps it is too much to ask that we simply have compassion for our fellow Americans who are sick or fearful of becoming so. Thousands of people want testing. Many, like David Newman of The Walking Dead, are sick with flu symptoms and are being denied testing. This makes no sense.

“The broader the testing and the less finger-pointing we have, the better. America is strong. We are a resilient people, but we’re stronger when we stand together,” he concluded.

In a Sunday statement, Paul’s deputy chief of staff, Sergio Gor, announced that the lawmaker had tested positive for the coronavirus. “He is feeling fine and is in quarantine,” Gor said. “He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.”

Paul’s announcement came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) pulled out of negotiations on bipartisan rescue package aimed at alleviating the effects of the outbreak, and instead, announcing that she would push forward with her own plan."

Rio Giardinieri, 52, told Fox 11 Los Angeles that he suffered from a cough, headache, back pain, and fatigue after he caught the coronavirus, which he believes he caught at a conference in New York.

Doctors in South Florida diagnosed him with the coronavirus and pneumonia and put him on oxygen in the intensive care unit (ICU).

More than a week later, doctors said there was nothing more they could do for him, so on Friday evening, Giardinieri said his goodbyes to his wife and three kids.

“I was at the point where I was barely able to speak and breathing was very challenging,” Giardinieri said. “I really thought my end was there.”

Then, a friend forwarded him an article about hydroxychloroquine, a prescription drug used to treat illnesses such as malaria and lupus. Other studies conducted overseas have found it to be a promising treatment for coronavirus, although it has not yet been approved by health officials.

Trump said last week he was asking the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to fast-track its testing of hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, as a treatment for the coronavirus.

Giardinieri said he got in touch with an infectious disease doctor about hydroxychloroquine.

“He gave me all the reasons why I would probably not want to try it because there are no trials, there’s no testing, it was not something that was approved,” said Giardinieri.

“And I said, ‘Look, I don’t know if I’m going to make it until the morning,’ because at that point I really thought I was coming to the end because I couldn’t breathe anymore,” Giardinieri continued.

The doctor agreed and within 30 minutes, a nurse gave him an IV infusion of the medicine. After receiving the medicine via IV for about an hour, Giardinieri said he felt his heart beating rapidly and had another episode where he could barely breathe.

He added that he was given some Benadryl and other drugs so when he awoke at 4:45 a.m. “It was like nothing ever happened.”

Since the IV infusion, Giardinieri said he has had no fever or pain and can breathe. He added that doctors believe the episodes he experienced were related to his body fighting the virus as opposed to a reaction to the medicine.

Giardinieri had three doses of the medicine since his first dose and hopes to be discharged in five days.

“To me, there was no doubt in mind that I wouldn’t make it until morning,” said Giardinieri. “So to me, the drug saved my life.”"

After various Olympic teams under the Team USA umbrella along with the nations of Canada and Brazil, said that they would not send their athletes to the games without massive changes or a postponement, the decision to postpone became, in Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s words, “inevitable.”

“On the basis of the information the IOC has, postponement has been decided,” Pound told USA Today in a phone interview. “The parameters going forward have not been determined, but the Games are not going to start on July 24, that much I know.

“It will come in stages,” he said. “We will postpone this and begin to deal with all the ramifications of moving this, which are immense.”

When asked about Pound’s claim that the Olympics will in fact be postponed, the IOC would only say they are looking at “scenarios.”

“Well, as we announced yesterday, we are looking at scenarios,” said IOC Spokesman Mark Adams.

According to USA Today:

The Olympics would be the latest – and, by far, most significant – sporting event to be impacted by the coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December. Also known as COVID-19, the virus rapidly spread throughout China and across the world in subsequent months, infecting hundreds of thousands of people and causing substantial disruptions to daily life in numerous countries. Pound’s comments came less than 24 hours after IOC president Thomas Bach indicated, for the first time, that postponing the Tokyo Games would be a possibility. In a letter to the athlete community, he said the IOC would begin exploring alternate ways to stage the Games, including postponement, and plan to reach a decision within the next four weeks.

On Sunday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had called the suspension of the Olympics, “inevitable,” unless it could be played in full.

“It’s still under political attack right when we need care the most,” Obama wrote on Twitter, as the coronavirus crisis continues.

Obama celebrated the tenth anniversary of his signature ACA bill, also known as Obamacare, sharing a video recalling the moment it passed in Congress.

“We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone,” Obama wrote.

Ten years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It protected preexisting conditions, cut the uninsured rate in half, and lots more.

A Texas lawsuit challenging Obamacare is currently slated to go to the Supreme Court with a ruling expected in 2021.

President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans killed the Obamacare individual mandate requirement for health insurance in 2017.

Trump was asked about the Supreme Court case and Obamacare in a press briefing on Sunday.

“What we want to do is get rid of the bad health care and put in a great health care,” Trump replied.

He reassured Americans that he and Republicans would protect the provision to protect people with preexisting conditions.

“We will always — I will say this, I can make this commitment to you: The Republican Party is fully backing preexisting conditions,” he said."

AD

In a statement, Pompeo listed ways he said the Iranian authorities had contributed to the spread of the virus: by lying about the true scale of Iran’s coronavirus crisis, by continuing flights to China as covid-19 was spreading, by stealing money intended for medical supplies and by hoarding medical equipment such as masks and gloves to sell on the black market.

AD

Khamenei’s televised comments on Sunday were made in response to U.S. offers to send aid to Iran as Tehran struggles to contain the highest coronavirus infection rate in the Middle East. Khamenei said the United States could not be trusted to help because it “may” have created the coronavirus now sweeping the world.

“I do not know how real this accusation is, but when it exists, what wise man would trust you to bring them medication?” Khamenei said, addressing the United States. “Possibly your medicine is a way to spread the virus more.”

AD

He added: “You might send people as doctors and therapists, and maybe they would want to come here and see the effect of the poison they have produced in person.”

The Iranian leader also pointed out that the United States is failing to curtail the spread of the disease at home. If America has help to offer, “spend it on yourselves,” he said.

AD

“You have shortages yourself,” he said. “Statements by American officials . . . are explicitly saying they have major shortages, both in terms of preventive equipment and also medicine.”

The spat over responsibility for the coronavirus’s spread came as Iran and America both battle escalating rates of infection among their populations. Over the weekend, the United States overtook Iran and other nations to become the country with the third-largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world, with more than 40,000 reported as of Monday. Iran said Monday that the number of infections in the previous 24 hours had climbed by 1,411 to 23,049, with 127 deaths, bringing the toll to 1,812.

AD

There have been indications, however, that Iran has failed to disclose the true number of people afflicted, including satellite and video evidence that Iran was digging vast graves for victims just days after announcing the first cases.

AD

Iran has blamed the crippling U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration for the difficulties the country has confronted, saying they have contributed to shortages of preventive equipment such as face masks and gloves as well as medicine.

In a speech to the Iranian cabinet carried live on Iranian television Monday, President Hassan Rouhani called America’s offers of help “the biggest lie.”

“If they want to help Iran, all they need to do is to lift sanctions . . . Then we can deal with the coronavirus outbreak,” he said.

AD

In his tweet, Zarif urged countries around the world to ignore the U.S. sanctions, which target most sectors of the Iranian economy. “The ONLY remedy: DEFY U.S. mass punishment,” he wrote."

""Their failure has harmed U.S.-Afghan relations and, sadly, dishonors those Afghan, Americans, and Coalition partners who have sacrificed their lives and treasure in the struggle to build a new future for this country.""

AD

AD

For weeks, the Trump administration has been pressuring the Afghan government to put together a united team to negotiate with the Taliban and form a lasting peace deal in Afghanistan that allows for the withdrawal of U.S. forces.

Pompeo's statement reflects the Trump administration's willingness to condition aid to Afghanistan in order to force the compliance of Ghani and Abdullah.

""We are prepared to reduce by another $1 billion in 2021,"" Pompeo said, emphasizing that the two leaders' intransigence would not delay America's withdrawal plans.

""We are proceeding with the conditions-based withdrawal of our forces in accordance with the U.S.-Taliban agreement,"" he added.

AD

After leaving Afghanistan, Pompeo met with the Taliban's chief negotiator in Qatar. Following those discussions, he told reporters that the Trump administration's principal concern right now is the Afghan leadership, not the Taliban.

AD

""They committed to reducing ­violence and they've largely done that,"" Pompeo said, referring to the Taliban.

He added that he hoped the United States wouldn't need to withhold aid from Afghanistan.

""We are hopeful, frankly, that they will get their act together and we won't have to do it. But we're prepared to do that,"" Pompeo said.

Pompeo arrived in Kabul on Monday in hopes of resolving a clash between Ghani and Abdullah, who is attempting to form a parallel government. Pompeo spent the day meeting privately with both leaders, first separately and then together, before leaving the country less than nine hours after he landed.

AD

The secretary's sudden trip from Washington, even with the novel coronavirus upending life in the United States and consuming its government, was a dramatic indicator of U.S. officials' growing alarm at the lengthening political stalemate here — both for its potential to erupt into a violent civil conflict and to undermine the peace process.

AD

The peace agreement signed Feb. 29 between U.S. and Taliban officials was expected to allow thousands of U.S. troops to begin leaving Afghanistan soon and to pave the way for negotiations between Taliban and Afghan leaders on a shared government in the future. Instead, both plans have bogged down, and no date has been set for the talks.

""Unless this crisis gets resolved and resolved soon, it could affect the peace process, which was an opportunity to end . . . 40 years of war. And our agreement with the Talibs could be put at risk,"" a senior State Department official told journalists traveling with Pompeo, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be candid.

AD

The official said Pompeo's ""authority"" as the top U.S. diplomat and a close adviser to President Trump gives him more potential influence than other intermediaries on Ghani and Abdullah, who are bitterly estranged after co-governing for five years. In recent weeks, both Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. diplomat spearheading the peace talks, and senior Afghan political and religious leaders have tried to find a compromise — to no avail.

AD

Even with ""a lot going on,"" including the coronavirus pandemic, the official said, Pompeo had ""come all the way here"" to ""push"" both Afghan leaders to form an inclusive government and to stress the dangers that could result ""if they don't do the right thing."" The official said there was particular concern that the Afghan defense forces could split between ""two presidents and two commanders in chief, or worse.""

What the Trump administration wants is for Ghani and Abdullah to agree on an ""inclusive government that is acceptable to both,"" the official said. ""We are encouraging them to rise to the occasion"" and ""put the country first.""

AD

After back-to-back meetings, with Pompeo shuttling between Ghani's and Abdullah's palaces — one block apart — and then meeting with them together, no official statements were made.

AD

Pompeo then flew to Qatar, where he met with the Taliban's chief negotiator, Abdul Ghani Baradar. The two men spoke for about an hour at Al Udeid Air Base in Doha, where Pompeo pressed the Taliban ""to continue to comply with the agreement signed last month,"" said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus.

The political crisis arose after the presidential election in September. Ghani, the incumbent, was declared the winner last month, but Abdullah alleged massive fraud and refused to concede. The two have been locked in a tense stalemate for two weeks, while Abdullah, backed by an array of former ethnic-minority militia leaders, has begun naming his own governors and cabinet members.

AD

Meanwhile, no progress has been made on forming a government delegation to meet with the Taliban, even though those talks were scheduled to begin March 10. In a separate dispute, Ghani has refused to immediately release 5,000 Taliban prisoners as the U.S.-Taliban agreement stipulated, throwing that deal into doubt as well, and leaving unclear if and when American troops can begin pulling out in large numbers.

Pompeo's mission is eerily reminiscent of what transpired after the previous Afghan presidential election, in 2014, when then-Secretary of State John F. Kerry successfully mediated an identical spat between Ghani and Abdullah. Both claimed to have won the presidency in a fraud-marred election, but Kerry persuaded them to accept a power-sharing arrangement. It has proved tense and fractious.

Pompeo, who attended the signing of the peace agreement in Qatar, said at the time that the path forward would be “rocky” and that talks between Taliban and Afghan leaders would be difficult. But he also said that while Taliban leaders have “an enormous amount of blood on their hands, they have now made a break” with their past and promised not to allow anti-U.S. terrorist activities on Afghan soil."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/how-canada-approved-an-assad-loyalist-to-serve-the-countrys-terrorized-syrian-refugees/2020/03/23/8ac161dc-6984-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world,2020-03-23T06:17:46,How Canada approved an Assad loyalist to serve the country’s terrorized Syrian refugees,"Since 2015, Canada has resettled more than 50,000 refugees who have fled Syria’s bloody civil war. They included members of the White Helmets, a volunteer group that has rescued thousands of civilians harmed by Syrian and Russian airstrikes.

Ramli has described the White Helmets as a “terrorist organization” — echoing unsubstantiated claims made by Assad and his backers in Russia. As honorary consul, Ramli would have authority over renewing passports, notarizing documents and helping Syrians secure legal representation, among other services.

AD

AD

Then-Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said she hadn’t been informed of Ramli’s appointment. She called Ramli’s views “shocking and unacceptable,” condemned her department for signing off, and withdrew the approval.

Ramli declined to comment. He told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that his political views wouldn’t interfere with his ability to execute his duties fairly. Freeland announced the revocation of his status on Sept. 25.

But a question remained: How did it happen in the first place?

Documents obtained by The Washington Post under an access to information request reveal deficiencies in what was a quicker-than-average vetting process.

They show that the officials who vetted Ramli knew of his support for Damascus but didn’t discover views they considered “extreme” enough to forestall approval. They show that officials fielded queries from concerned Syrians well before Ramli was to take up his post but struggled to respond and pushed ahead anyway.

Canada joined several other countries, including the United States, in ejecting all Syrian diplomats after the massacre of 108 civilians in the Syrian area of Houla in 2012. Since then, honorary consuls in Vancouver and Montreal have operated intermittently to provide consular services to Syrians in Canada and the United States.

AD

AD

Canadian government guidelines for honorary consuls direct the Foreign Ministry to avoid “controversial or politically active persons” in favor of individuals “of good standing and reputation in the local community.”

Thomas Juneau, a political scientist at the University of Ottawa, said locals considered Ramli a “thug” of Assad. Aside from the appointment’s “abysmal optics,” he said, there was fear that the personal information of Syrians who opposed Assad might make its way back to him or that they could be targets of retribution.

Approving an honorary consul application in Canada typically takes four to six weeks. Ramli’s took less than three.

AD

Canada began vetting the restaurateur on July 25. Sébastien Beaulieu, then executive coordinator for Syria, based in Beirut, wrote colleagues an email on Aug. 7.

AD

Given the “context of our administrative and consular engagement with the Syrians, and given that this is effectively the only service and document delivery point for Syrians in Canada and the U.S.,” he wrote, “we favor the prompt review/approval of this request, barring any real adverse information related to the proposed candidate . . . other than expected proximity/alignment with Damascus.”

Beaulieu, now Canada’s ambassador to Senegal,hand-delivered the note of approval to a Syrian official at the United Nations in New York on Aug. 14.

AD

Five days later, Robin Wett­laufer, then Canada’s head of political affairs for Syria in Istanbul, forwarded colleagues a message from a Syrian contact in Montreal. The person described the appointment as “really scary,” and said he or she had flagged concerns about Ramli to the Canadian Foreign Ministry the month before.

AD

Wettlaufer sought help from officials in the protocol and Middle East relations offices in crafting responses to messages she continued to receive about the appointment. On Sept. 20, in light of new information (redacted in the documents released to The Post), she recommended officials “set the record straight.” She attached to the email photos of Ramli’s Hummer and social media comments she translated from Arabic to English.

“I don’t know how the Canadian government allows this monster and real threat to be [an] honorary [consul],” one person wrote.

AD

On Sept. 22, Emmanuelle Lamoureux, Canada’s ambassador to Lebanon, asked colleagues for guidance over the “unfolding situation.” Members of her team were off to Syria that week.

Sandra McCardell, the Foreign Ministry’s director general for the Middle East, said she would bring up Ramli’s “inappropriate and provocative conduct” with Syrian officials at the United Nations in New York that week.

AD

The Maclean’s story landed the next day.

Senior managers immediately requested a review of the appointment, and the department prepared to revoke Ramli’s status before he took up his post on Oct. 1. Those involved in the approval process drafted a chronology of events.

AD

In one email, Sean Boyd, executive director for Middle East relations, was asked for bullet points on “what happened to let this one pass.” He said the “vetting of business relationships and social media” didn’t flag anything “of significant concern or that could be construed as extreme views.” He said social media posts in Arabic weren’t searched.

It appeared “the concerns of the local community” and the degree of Ramli’s “political ­activism” had not been “sufficiently probed/broadly known” before his appointment, Boyd said.

But another email noted that Ramli’s support for the regime, including on social media, and experience helping to organize a demonstration against U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria in 2018 were flagged as early as the first week of August.

AD

AD

“His tone was, however, not as strong as other pro-regime Canadians in Canada,” one person wrote, andan online search did not reveal Ramli’s position on the White Helmets.

The Washington Post found an article Ramli shared on his Facebook page in 2018 from the Russian state-sponsored media outlet RT describing Canada’s decision to resettle the White Helmets as “dangerous and criminal.”

The Office of Protocol said revoking Ramli’s approval would bring “relief” to Syrians, who had highlighted Ramli’s attempts to “intimidate” them and his “self-acknowledged financial support for an organization accused of diverting humanitarian aid funds to the Syrian regime.”

The incident highlights a broader conundrum: how to ensure that Syrians have access to key consular services without exposing refugees to the Assad regime, which is responsible for the nominations.

“On the one hand, you don’t want to legitimize the regime in any way and to approve an individual [who] will very much intimidate the population,” Juneau said. “At the same time, by not appointing anyone, you are penalizing Syrians who need access to services.”

It’s a “difficult situation” for the government, he said, but doesn’t excuse Ramli’s approval.

“Considering that it is Syria, the speed at which it was delivered was somewhat worrisome,” said Ferry de Kerckhove, a former Canadian diplomat.

He said the vetting process was “conducted as usual” — and that might have been the problem."

As of late Monday, more than 43,600 cases had been reported across the United States, and at least 530 people have died nationwide. The day marked a grim milestone, too, as the first officials in the U.S. reported more than 100 deaths in a single day since the outbreak began.

With statewide orders to stay home spreading even further across the country, the pandemic has continued to shutter businesses and thrashed the stock markets. The Federal Reserve again announced an unprecedented set of actions, and Congress has in turn been facing steep pressure to protect an economy knocked off course.

Lawmakers’ current solution is to flood the economy with capital to revive impacted households and businesses, including direct payments to many Americans and about $850 billion in loan and assistance programs for businesses and governments.

Yet Democrats blocked the package, arguing that the bill as it stood did too much to help corporations and not enough to support workers — an argument seemingly floated at one point over the weekend by Trump himself.

As they neared a resolution in private talks on Monday evening, Trump changed his tune again.

“Our country wasn’t built to be shut down,” he said on Monday afternoon. “At some point, we’re going to be opening up our country. It’s going to be pretty soon.”

Even as they go against the advice of his own public health advisers, the president’s comments reflect an argument increasingly being made across the political right: No matter how many people lose their lives to the virus, millions more stand to face ruin if the economy remains effectively shut down.

On Monday, those health officials insisted that scaling back distancing measures could devastate hospitals or even allow the spread of the virus to rebound."

Japan had so far dodged the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, but last weekend the capital was proof of what many experts have long warned: people might put up with social distancing for a few weeks, but eventually tire of remaining indoors, and seize on the smallest piece of good news as an excuse to venture out again.

So much for the “obedient” Japanese of some crude stereotypes. It also does not bode well for the idea that Europe and the United States will be able to maintain social distancing for months on end.

“I am very concerned about complacency and fatigue,” said Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease expert at Kobe University. “People cannot stand remaining in a restricted lifestyle for a long, long time.”

AD

Japan has been a puzzling outlier in the coronavirus pandemic.

Despite limited testing in the early weeks of the outbreak, and despite cold weather perfect for spreading respiratory infections, Japan has avoided the kind of explosive growth in infections seen in South Korea, Europe and the United States.

AD

Japan added 38 new cases on Monday, bringing the number of confirmed infections to 1,140, with 42 deaths, not including cases from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

The sense here is that Japan has dodged a bullet, either by luck or judgment, but experts warn the country is not invincible.

“I’m deeply concerned about the current situation in Japan,” said Hitoshi Oshitani, a virology professor at Tohoku University’s School of Medicine and a member of the government’s own expert advisory panel.

AD

“Now the first wave of is almost under control … but the second wave has already started,” he said. “It is probably going to be much worse, and we are going to have more outbreaks, and some of them are going to be big.”

Some critics say Japan is deliberately burying its head in the sand, either to protect its economy from a damaging shutdown or in a vain bid to lower the chances of an Olympics cancellation.

AD

But by rationing tests only to people with prolonged fevers and more serious symptoms, they argue, the government has undercounted the number of infections and lulled the country into a false sense of security.

“The government has given an optimistic picture all along, and so people don’t have an image of it being that scary,” said Masahiro Kami, executive director at Medical Governance Research Institute, who has been calling for more extensive testing. “That’s natural if you see just the numbers.”

AD

But Oshitani and Iwata say the government has been wise to concentrate its resources and its testing capabilities on people with more serious symptoms, and needs to strike a balance between strict measures and sustainable ones.

Each region, Iwata says, needs to make its own decision on how strict to be in imposing social distancing measures, depending on their local caseload — precisely because strict controls cannot be sustained forever, and should be reserved for when they are most needed. And many people did stay home last weekend in cities like Osaka and Kobe where infection rates have been climbing, he says.

But that doesn’t excuse what happened in Tokyo, Saitama and Sendai last weekend, critics say.

They bemoan a lack of leadership from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has personally done little to drive home the importance of social distancing to the general public and often seems to have taken a back seat role to Health Minister Katsunobu Kato.

AD

“It’s situations like this where Abe has not stepped up,” said Jeff Kingston, a professor at Temple University Japan. “It’s a familiar situation during this crisis where Abe has been MIA.”

In Tokyo, some people are working from home, but commuter trains remain packed during the rush hour. Kami is worried the government seems to be putting the economy ahead of the public’s health.

Whether Japanese habits — wearing masks, and bowing rather than shaking hands — have helped slow the epidemic’s spread remains an open question.

But good habits won’t protect Japan if complacency sets in, especially with a new wave of infected people entering the country from Europe and the United States, experts say.

With little evidence, ultranationalist Italian politician Matteo Salvini linked the arrival of the coronavirus to African migrants illegally crossing the Mediterranean and landing in Italy. And President Trump, buffeted by a tanking economy and mounting criticism over his handling of the crisis, renewed his anti-immigration rhetoric Monday, implying border controls were necessary to stave off the crisis.

THIS IS WHY WE NEED BORDERS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020

But away from the White House and Europe’s capitals, there are others who can’t count on the protection of their nation. For the approximately 70 million displaced people worldwide, the pandemic poses a double threat: Crammed refugee camps are especially vulnerable to the spread of disease, and national governments, which, at the best of times, have limited resources to spare for asylum seekers and migrants, will be even less inclined to expend them amid the crisis in support of noncitizens.

Aid agencies fear a looming disaster. “When the virus hits overcrowded settlements in places like Iran, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Greece, the consequences will be devastating,” Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said last week. “There will also be carnage when the virus reaches parts of Syria, Yemen and Venezuela, where hospitals have been demolished and health systems have collapsed.”

AD

AD

So far, there have been few confirmed positive cases, be it in the Rohingya camps on Bangladesh’s border with Myanmar or Greece’s dingy island encampments of marooned migrants. That’s hardly cause for encouragement. Few of these settlements have the capacity for effective testing.

“It could create a false and dangerous sense of comfort,” said Muhammad Hamid Zaman, a professor of biomedical engineering and international health at Boston University, to Foreign Policy. “Just because we don’t have data doesn’t mean the problem doesn’t exist.”

The problem could exist in a lot of beleaguered places — from Yemen, where millions are suffering from malnutrition and close to 4 million live in makeshift camps, to Libya, where locals and migrants cope with the chaos of a collapsed state locked in civil war, to Iraq, where 1.5 million people are still displaced in the aftermath of the battles against the Islamic State.

AD

AD

“War-shattered Syria is perhaps the biggest concern, particularly the northwest of the country where fighting continues between government forces and rebels despite a fragile cease-fire,” my colleagues reported. “Nearly 4 million people, most of them displaced from elsewhere in the country, are crammed into a sliver of territory along the Turkish border, which has surpassed Gaza as the most densely populated part of the Middle East.”

And in Gaza, hemmed in by Israel, the risks are great. “If the virus reaches us, many people will die,” said Mahmoud Shakshak, 65, an unemployed resident of a semi-permanent refugee camp in the blockaded territory, to The Post. “Not just because of the virus, but because the world will close to us and they will let us die alone.”

Within Europe’s borders, refugees and asylum seekers face an all the more precarious existence in the shadow of the pandemic. “The situation of exiled people is unspeakable: lack of accommodation, cold, humidity, stress, fatigue, crowding together in light tents, daily expulsion from places of life, deplorable sanitary conditions,” wrote 24 French aid organizations in a letter addressed to the government last week, warning of the deplorable situation for many migrants in northern France.

AD

AD

But there’s limited sympathy for them, now. “Refugees and migrants are often the first to be stigmatized and are often unjustifiably blamed for spreading viruses,” noted the NRC. “We have seen some populist politicians across Europe who rail against migration and are attempting to draw a clear link between migrants and refugees and the outbreak, despite there being no evidence to support this.”

The Trump administration also followed suit, invoking the outbreak to enact a new crackdown that would enable the administration to immediately turn away asylum seekers who appear at U.S. borders.

“The proposed new ban on asylum that would turn back asylum seekers will endanger the lives of even more refugees and further jeopardize our collective public health by sending people to live on the Mexican side of the border where they will lack adequate shelter and care and where there is no way to prevent the spread of coronavirus,” wrote Yael Shacher of Refugees International.

Aid organizations are infuriated by the seeming indifference of national governments to the refugee plight. “How are you supposed to wash your hands regularly if you have no running water or soap?” asked Jonathan Whittall of Doctors Without Borders. “How can you implement ‘social distancing’ if you live in a slum or a refugee camp? How are you supposed to stop crossing borders if you are fleeing from war?”"

Northwell has doubled its stock of ventilators, considered necessary to treat covid-19 patients in respiratory distress, Lyman said, spending millions on the machines that cost between $10,000 and $40,000. The network employs about 72,000 people, but more manpower is needed, he said, to staff facilities in anticipation of a patient surge that threatens to overwhelm hospitals’ ability to care for those who become gravely ill. The private health-care network is looking outside the area for medical professionals and seeking nurses to work on a per diem basis.

New York continues to lead the country in confirmed covid-19 cases, and the numbers are expected to accelerate rapidly in the coming days and weeks. Statewide, there were about 20,000 confirmed cases Monday, about 5,000 of which were new. New York City had more than 13,000 cases, with more than 2,200 hospitalized and 525 in intensive care, according to the most recently available data. And while officials attributed the spike in part to expanded testing, fear remains that hospitals are neither prepared nor equipped for what’s to come.

For now, in the second week of a widespread quarantine that’s been ordered throughout the state, hospitals in New York City continued to fare relatively well, according to two doctors who work at separate facilities and, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Theirs were still functioning smoothly, they said, although doctors and other health-care workers were feeling strain and stress about the shortage of proper masks and protective gear.

Their emergency rooms remain open and, with most elective surgeries postponed or canceled, the hospitals overall had become quieter and emptier than usual.

Both said intensive care units were beginning to fill up with patients on ventilators but had not reached a crisis yet. Some hospitals have plans to expand intensive care to other floors, though that move will be limited by factors such as the number of rooms where patients can be isolated and the number of ventilators.

Approximately 280 people were hospitalized with covid-19 at NYU Langone Health facilities across New York City and Long Island, according to a person familiar with the matter who said that officials there have focused on expanding the number of intensive care beds, reducing overcrowding and rationing protective equipment such as masks, gloves and gowns.

AD

AD

“We have a sufficient supply of ventilators at this time,” this person said. “We also have about 10 days of PPE [personal protective equipment]. We are rationing them through re-use and sterilization.”

The shortage of N95 masks, considered necessary by health-care professionals because they screen out most small particles, remains a particular concern in New York and elsewhere across the country. Judy Sheridan-Gonzalez, a practicing nurse and president of the New York State Nurses Association, described the organization’s 40,000 members as “terrified” and faulted the Trump administration for its haphazard initial response to threat.

“We don’t feel prepared at all,” she said. “We’re not given the supplies that we believe we need.”

AD

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said over the weekend that 1 million N95 masks were being rushed to New York City. He also has focused on hospital capacity and on Monday ordered medical facilities statewide to expand their number of beds by 50 percent.

AD

In the afternoon, Cuomo toured the Javits Center, a massive convention hall that hosts Comic-Con and major auto shows that was being converted to a 1,000-bed temporary hospital with the aid of the Army Corps of Engineers.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said hospital beds were being erected on a rolling basis around the city. At the Coler Rehabilitation and Nursing Care Center on Roosevelt Island, 100 new beds were going to be available this week with an additional 240 expected next week.

New York City’s 11 public hospitals have enough equipment and supplies to get through this week, he told CNN early Monday. The city was in desperate need of ventilators, especially, and appealed to private citizens to provide them if possible. “If we don’t get ventilators this week, we’re going to start losing lives we could have saved,” de Blasio said. “I can’t be blunter than that.”

AD

Following a conversation with President Trump and Vice President Pence, the city was set to receive 400 ventilators from the federal stockpile, he said later.

The story of preparedness in New York to date has been one of piecemeal efforts to accumulate resources. “Our need for ventilators is in the thousands, but we’re going to fight every day to stay ahead of this curve,” de Blasio said. “Four hundred ventilators is a huge step forward to help us get through this week and into the next.”"

Since peaking in mid-February, the number of active infections in China has begun a steep decline, as measures that were taken appear to have slowed the spread of the virus in that country. Western Europe, in particular Italy, has emerged as the new epicenter of the virus, and more people have died in that country from the virus than in China. The number of known cases has also sharply increased in the United States as testing becomes more widespread.

As the virus spreads worldwide, South Korea appears to be the only other country with a widespread outbreak that has also reversed the trend of active cases, while the number continues to climb in several Western European countries and Iran.

The Trump administration has imposed restrictions on travelers from countries including China, Iran and most European countries and is warning Americans against travel to all overseas places.

China has reported the most confirmed cases worldwide, with a majority in the Hubei province, where Chinese health officials said the new virus strain originated in wild animals sold at a market in the capital city of Wuhan. In recent weeks, as the number of new cases climbed around the world, the number in China has slowed.

They may be more preview than anomaly.,"But while some unique aspects have amplified the scale, doctors and health officials say other countries should regard Italy not as an outlier or an example of missteps, but as a harrowing preview of the hardships they might soon have at hand. Other countries could easily follow the pattern in Italy, with the number of deaths soaring weeks after an initial, drastic spike in cases.

AD

The disaster in Italy does not stem from gross government negligence. Rather, analysts say it is partly a consequence of the weeks between the emergence of the outbreak and the government decision to absolutely lock down the population. And though many in Italy now argue that their government waited too long, democracies across the West have been mulling the same decisions — and in some cases have acted less decisively.

AD

Neither is the crisis in Italy a product of an especially feeble health system. Italy has fewer acute-care beds relative to its population than South Korea or Germany, but more than Britain or the United States. The death toll is being intensified by breakdowns at hospitals, but the strains are the same as could happen anywhere in the developed world that sees such a surge in coronavirus cases.

“This emergency is something so huge that all over the world, not just in Italy, you’re going to be forever unprepared,” said Massimo Galli, head of the infectious-disease unit at Sacco Hospital in Milan. He said governments everywhere “are taking this classic attitude to face the problem slowly.”

According to the most recent data from Italy’s National Health Service, those who have died had a median age of 80. But the virus isn’t hitting exclusively the oldest and most frail. Some 45 percent of the dead were between ages 60 and 79. And among the first 3,200 deaths reported in the country, 36 were in their 30s or 40s.

AD

AD

At nearly any age, men appear to be more susceptible — something that is reflected in data from other countries, too, and that in Italy could be linked to the higher male smoking rate.

Even if Italy’s death count is heightened by its elderly population, doctors say there is another reason other Western countries haven’t yet seen a comparable toll: The virus may have been spreading in Italy for longer, and it kills slowly.

The people with the most severe coronavirus cases can remain in intensive-care beds for weeks before dying. That triggers a cascade of problems during a large-scale outbreak, as has been playing out now in northern Italy, where patients have been arriving at hospitals — struggling to breathe — only to find that there are no beds or ventilators.

AD

“The massive arrival of patients becomes impossible to manage,” said Mirco Nacoti, a doctor at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, where he said there are 500 patients in need of intensive care and just 100 ICU beds. “The health system is totally destroyed. Nobody has seen a similar situation. It’s a catastrophe.”

AD

The death count has continued to soar even as the daily increase of total cases has slightly decelerated. Two weeks ago, on the day that Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced a nationwide lockdown, 463 people had died of the virus.

Since then, the number of total cases in the country has grown sevenfold. But the death toll is 13 times as high as it was — a devastating development in a country with one-twentieth the population of China.

AD

According to the Italian government’s official data, a staggering 9.5 percent of the people who contracted the coronavirus have died. In Lombardy, the hard-hit northern region, the data indicates an even higher mortality rate — more than 13 percent. Such rates are far above those seen in other parts of the world, including Hubei province in China, and have led at least one Italian doctor to speculate that Italy could be seeing a more aggressive viral strain.

AD

But most virologists here, citing scientific analysis of the strains, say the virus appears to be no different than the one that hit China.

The actual Italian death rate, they say, is probably far lower than what the government numbers suggest. The unofficial estimates assume the actual number of people infected with the virus — people who have not yet been tested — is massive. In other words, several hundred thousand people in Italy may be carrying the virus.

“It’s a huge iceberg,” said Fabrizio Pregliasco, a virologist at the University of Milan. “We are only looking at those who are sick.”

Though Italian leaders touted widespread testing at the beginning of the outbreak, the government has applied tight guidelines for who can be given swabs. Health officials have been testing those who have severe symptoms and are in need of obvious medical care. Government authorities have said that mass-scale testing could put health-care workers at risk, and that the best method to slow the transmission rate is for people to simply stay at home.

But this strategy has a downside, because it fails to find asymptomatic or mild carriers, and increases the odds that the virus will spread undetected. Even amid a lockdown, such carriers could be taking buses, going to the grocery store or infecting their families. Italy’s Health Ministry, in a statement provided to The Washington Post, said it is trying to broaden its testing, particularly of health workers and people who had contact with positive patients.

“We are evaluating all of the technological and epidemiological tools to further improve this tracking,” the ministry said.

Other countries, notably South Korea, have succeeded in controlling the virus by rigorously testing those with suspected exposure. Germany has also tested more liberally than most other European countries, a partial explanation for its statistically low death rate, along with the fact that the first outbreaks in that country have disproportionately hit the young. In Germany, experts have said they expect the death rate to eventually rise — becoming more in line with Italy’s.

Another major factor in Italy’s enormous death toll is the struggle of hospitals to keep up. In a paper released several days ago, a team of doctors at the main public hospital in Bergamo described how their facility was buckling under the pressure. And they said other facilities in the area were faring even worse — short on ventilators, oxygen and protective equipment.

“Patients lay on floor mattresses,” they wrote.

AD

AD

Health officials from Madrid to New York City are now bracing for similar problems. And though social distancing is aimed at reducing the rate at which the virus spreads, allowing hospitals to more adequately cope, in Italy the rigid measures came too late, experts say.

At the beginning of the outbreak, the country put 11 small towns under lockdown. But even then, there were signs that many cases were occurring elsewhere. By early March, regional authorities were signaling alarm about two new areas — this time, in Bergamo province. The areas happened to be heavily industrialized. Business groups raised opposition. The government took no action.

“Of course, had the hard line been drawn immediately, we would’ve likely seen results,” said Claudio Cancelli, the mayor of Nembro, one of the hot-spot towns. “We ultimately were all a bit tardy in understanding the gravity of what was happening.”

By the time the government took action — locking down all of Lombardy on March 9, and all of the country two days later — the explosion had already been set in motion.

AD

Bergamo has become the ­flashing-red hot spot in Italy, the site of more deaths than any other place in Italy. In Nembro alone, with a population of 11,500, some 120 people have died since the beginning of March — as many deaths as the town normally sees in one year.

“We’re still paying the consequences of what wasn’t done [more than] two weeks ago,” said Cancelli, who tested positive for the virus and had a fever for several days.

Nacoti, one of the doctors, said that at the hospital in Bergamo, 30 percent of the health workers had also contracted the virus. He said the death toll in the area could be even higher than what is known, because some elderly people are probably dying at home, never arriving at the hospital.

On Monday night, frustrated with the public’s refusal to abide by calls to practice strict social distancing measures — and fearing that a coming wave of coronavirus patients could soon overwhelm hospitals — Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued new edicts: People were ordered to stay at home, except to go shopping or visit the doctor or pharmacist. They will be permitted a bit of daily exercise. They were told not to travel — except to go to work, to do jobs they cannot do from home.

On March 23, the number of deaths in Italy from the virus increased by more than 600. The figures for death tolls and new cases, however, showed a decline from the stark increases of just a few days before, suggesting that strict social-distancing measures may be slowing the outbreak.

My friend Gianluigi loves kids. In fact, he has four. He has a daughter, Alma, from a previous relationship. And he has two sons, Gioele and Lev, with his current partner, and she has a daughter, Rada, from a previous relationship. It sounds complicated, but it isn’t.

Alma is eight and lives with her mother, but Gianluigi is used to seeing her every day. He drives her to school, brings her to check out books at the children’s library, and then they get ice cream. He is there for her in ways big and small, even if they don’t live under the same roof.

Infected 63,927 Deaths 6,077 (As of March 23 in Italy)

“Quarantine” and “contamination” are words that are newly commonplace in Italy. They bring heartbreak to blended families.

Quarantine is not just for the sick; it’s most important for everyone who changes location: country, city, home, workplace. Every environment we live in is made also by other people, and every move we make brings some potential contamination from the old place to the new one. To understand if a person shows signs of infection, he or she has to spend a certain number of days without changing risk factors or introducing different people. In Italy, this self-distancing is 14 days.

Alma will soon move with her mother into her grandmother’s house, with different people around. Before that, to be sure she is perfectly healthy, she has been quarantined. She can’t have close contacts with anyone but her mother, because they don’t want to infect her grandmother, of course.

So Gianluigi and Alma can only meet outside, in the street, with no physical contact, no kisses.

Alma has a dog, Tuo (“yours” in Italian), and he is a very good excuse to go outside without many questions by the police because dogs have their needs. The three of them walk under the beautiful arcades of the city of Turin. Tuo barks; the father and daughter chat.

This new reality she is embracing: the school lessons (only virtual), the impossibility to hang out with other kids, the use of the smartphone, forbidden until two weeks ago and now allowed to video call friends and relatives.

The length of Tuo’s leash, 3.5 feet, is exactly the security distance allowed by quarantine rules so that Alma can avoid potential contamination. That distance is the invisible bond between a father and her daughter.

Every tear on Alma’s face is a drop of love, a missed hug she holds for her father to the end of the isolation.

In the past few days, a picture circulated across the media of Pope Francis walking around Via del Corso in Rome to reach the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore.

He is 83 years old; what about the “stay at home” thing? Polemical talks started around the country.

But that’s not the point. I’m sure God will make an exception for him, and also the prime minister.

Infected 59,138 Deaths 5,476 (As of March 22 in Italy)

I remember my grandparents and the idea we had around the concept of wrinkles when we were kids. Getting old meant becoming wiser and having tons of stories to tell to grandchildren. It meant to have a past that tells who you are, what you built, all the sacrifices made to buy a house, to raise kids, to pay for their tuition.

The psychoanalysis called “undoing” is an unconscious defense mechanism, the act of removing thoughts too hard to think about. And back when life was normal, just a few months ago, death could be undone, ignored as somewhere down the line. Now, the wrinkles mark the old as those most at risk from dying of the coronavirus.

So our elders can’t use the “undoing” defense, and they can’t even attend Mass to seek comfort because all functions are suspended. Italians are quite religious. Religion, especially for elderly people, is a strong support system not just for the warm sensation of being part of a strong community inside the church wall but also because the priest’s voice is a sign of trust. It keeps the faith alive with pride. That’s why Francis is still celebrating the Angelus on Sundays by live-streaming it.

My parents and my friends’ parents are in their 70s; and my empathy goes to them. They are locked down, feeling weak and at risk, hunted by an invisible enemy hidden like a tiger in the open lands of the savanna, waiting in the grasses for the next gazelle passing by.

But our elder population is smarter than gazelles. Their wrinkles taught them well.

You can’t fight the tiger; just stay downwind protected by the warm comfort of the house, because for sure the tiger will go away eventually.

“Il Sorpasso” is a popular Italian movie from 1962 by Dino Risi. Roberto, a young timid law student, meets Bruno, a 40-ish braggart and risk-taker. They set off on a gorgeous drive along the coasts of Tuscany and Lazio in Bruno’s convertible. It’s Ferragosto, the Aug. 15 national holiday.

After a crescendo of adventures and adrenaline experiences, the end is dramatic: Going faster and faster along a coastal freeway, Bruno tries to pass another car on a blind curve, and his Lancia sails off a rocky cliff, killing Roberto.

Infected 47,021 Deaths 4,032 (As of March 20 in Italy)

“Sorpasso” means overtake. We have just overtaken China in numbers of death from covid-19: 3,405 Italians and 3,253 Chinese. The per capita rate is even more incredible. China’s population is 1.3 billion; Italy has 60 million.

Reasons? Hard to tell. The average age population in China is lower than here. Our country is older, and we have a very low birthrate. China may have more resources. In Wuhan, the city where the virus started, China built a hospital in 10 days.

But I suspect our cultural attitudes as Italians have played the largest role. We live in an ego-referential Western world, where every rule can be discussed, disliked and ignored eventually.

The omnipotence of our own free will is a voice louder than rules, louder than God. We have lost the sense of civic obligation that builds strong communities with shared values.

I want to acknowledge that China had a one-child policy from 1980 to 2013. I’m not comparing a communist regime with our “Western” democracy. I mean that the Chinese are more respectful of rules in a country that crushes dissent. If the government says “stay at home,” that’s what they do.

The government here says to stay at home, and more than 43,000 people are reported for violating the prohibition for going out without an excuse. Hordes of people assaulted the Milano Central station to come back to the south of Italy. People were fined for picnicking in parks, for children playing ping-pong in the streets, or driving about just for fun. people found in parks for pick nicks, boys and girls playing ping-pong in the street in a small village, in Milano others driving around with no reasons.

A record 9,600 were fined Thursday alone, said the interior minister.

Sun Shuopeng, the vice president of the Chinese Red Cross who came here recently to help, said: “In Italy, too many people are in the street with no masks …. Increasing quarantine measures will help to find exposed people and treating them.”

This crazy situation won’t end before 18 months — the time estimated to find a vaccine. And we can’t come back to a normal life for a while. But I don’t want to be locked down my house as a prison with a drone yelling at me if I lay down the window. I don’t want more severe measures so fellow Italians could you for one damn time respecting rules PLEASE?!

All my illustrations are made by computer. After 20 years, I felt I missed something. I missed the mistakes made by the use of markers, brushes and paint.

So three months ago, we started in our studio a return to the original compulsory skill, mastering the human body, unadorned. We hired professional models to pose nude and brought out the pencils and acrylics.

And then, two weeks ago, we had to cancel our sessions, because the best way to prevent further spread of the coronavirus pandemic is to avoid the human body.

In Italy, the campaign #iorestoacasa (I’m staying home) has been implemented to its fullest. All commercial and cultural activities, including bars, restaurants, schools, cinemas and museums, are shut down.

During one of our last lunches outside, I had an idea: Why not keep the live modeling sessions, but with masks?

Art always has been a mirror of the times, a way to reflect on historic events and exorcise the troubles of life.

We got in touch with Open, an online magazine, and called on a group of Italian artists to interpret the classic line drawing in the era of coronavirus.

Beppe Giacobbe and Francesco Poroli are just a few of the artists involved in the show.

The models posed nude, except for wearing several different kids of face protection, to portray the escalating threat experienced in Italy, where the military has been called in to carry away the caskets. The artists participated remotely by videoconference.

Our message is that “staying home” does not mean “staying still”: We can all do our bit even in such suspended times. Be it a message of hope, an expression of beauty, a meaningful help to society.

Our sketches are auctioned online and the bids will be donated to the Italian Red Cross, which is helping both the health authorities and the most vulnerable population to respond to the crisis.

We called it the “Covid Uncovered” experience and hope to raise $25,000 by April 3. That was the date set for the expiration of our country’s forced quarantine, although we know it is not likely to end then. And we hope our auction will spark a worldwide movement.

Even as the virus knows no barriers, neither does art. It has always been the human endeavor that nourishes the spirit when science fails.

We can’t go outside. But we can. Truth is never black or white, so we embrace the shades of gray. We have a form for it: a self-declaration module from the government that is downloadable.

Beginning March 9, swamped by the dying, Italy clamped down on personal movement for its 60 million people, imposing a curfew and confusing rules for leaving the house that included carrying an “auto-certification” form. Penalty for violation: a hefty fine or three months in jail.

Infected 35,713 Deaths 2,978 (As of March 18 in Italy)

One the form, there are four boxes with reasons to be outside:

1. Work needs.

2. A situation of necessity.

3. Health reasons.

4. Coming back home.

Plus, there is a blank space.

Regarding this, I declare that: ___________________________

The form offers some examples of reasons to be outside: “I work in this or that place; I’m coming back to my home (address required); I’m going to the doctor … other specific reasons.”

My wife has to walk our dog Las Vegas later, so she will write: “Vado a pisciare il cane,” which, loosely translated, means, “I have to take the dog out to pee.”

I saw a woman stopped by the police. She was carrying some bags from the grocery store, it appeared. They argued, and I wasn’t sure how it all ended. What you can prove of your rightful business to move about your neighborhood is limited by what the police officer is willing to believe.

Those on patrol seem to be doing their best to punish those violating the law, in the interest of limiting further spread of the virus, but they also seem to be indulgent with others.

And so I wonder: How can I prove that I have to walk five minutes to reach the studio? How can I prove that, in the studio, I have pencils and brushes and markers and an atmosphere that can’t be built from home but that is essential to make me function to produce artwork and pay the bills?

Is that an acceptable reason for leaving the house? I don’t know. I think that our habits sometimes keep us alive more than medicine. But still, I’m sure there is a way to reshape our daily routine, starting from scratch; spending a weekend with your in-laws whom you can’t stand isn’t going to do it.

This is our new “situation of necessity,” and it’s going to last a long time.

Milan is a ghost town, or perhaps better, a ghost metropolis of 1.3 million people. I can cross the streets without waiting for the pedestrian green light.

My house is a five-minute walk from my studio in one of the most popular areas, the Navigli, so named for the system of navigable and interconnected canals designed by Leonardo da Vinci. It is a district full of laughter and aperitivo, bars and restaurants, one after another stretching along both sides of the canals. Now it’s all gone — people, tables outside, neon lights, fragments of music and conversation floating by.

Infected 27,980 Deaths 2,158 (As of March 17 in Italy)

I walked back from the studio at 8:30 p.m. It made me think of the movie “The Omega Man” from 1971 or the 2007 remake with Will Smith, “I am Legend.” I wondered whether I should expect to see some zombies coming from the alley to attack me.

At the end of the canal, I saw a figure that looked familiar. It’s the drug dealer of the area I see quite often, going around with his gigantic Amstaff terrier.

How quickly my perception has changed: Two weeks ago, I noticed him among hundreds of young people hanging out at night, and it was disturbing, a discordant note in an harmonic melody. Now I feel relieved by his presence, somehow. Seeing him still here lends a sense of belonging.

Like this is still the same place, we are still here, it’s the same reality, we are still alive, no zombies yet … breathe.

“Hi, Mum. How are you?”

“I’m good. … And you? Do you have enough food in the fridge?”

My mother was born three years after World War II ended, in a village in the south of Italy. Her generation grew up amid the wreckage of bombed buildings and the anxiety of hunger. For them, food is precious like little else.

When I was a teenager, we had a stash to last for months. I remember that our basement was packed with jars of tomatoes and eggplants, dozens of bottles of wine, any kind of supply. I remember my father was upset every time we threw half a plate of pasta in the garbage because we were full. “Don’t waste food!” he would say.

Infected 24,747 Deaths 1,809 (As of March 16 in Italy)

I’m sure this started as a genuine concern because of his survival heritage. And I’m also pretty sure this became an excuse for him to eat what me and my sister left on the plate.

[Hello from Italy. Your future is grimmer than you think.]

My parents don’t live in Milan but in a small town about 200 miles from here. For my mother’s 72nd birthday, we gave her and my father tickets to hear a famous singer from their generation. The concert was to take place in Milan on March 3. But by the middle of February, the virus had spread and it became dangerous for older people to use trains and gather in crowds. We decided to cancel their trip.

Italian mothers are exactly as you imagine them: caring and overprotective. Sometimes, it’s hard to have distance because your mother will regard you as her child even if your beard is white. And a mother who grew up after the war will always want to feed you because fat means healthy and skinny means sick.

We are not at war. Seeing people assaulting supermarkets here and in the United States is insane; we won’t starve. The food industry is still producing way more than we need.

But I thought about our country’s past and my mother’s childhood when I went to the supermarket and found a line today. The new law imposes limits on how many people can be in the supermarket at once: 10, to maintain social distance.

So people spend 15 minutes in the line outside just to buy a salad or a sandwich for lunch, or an orange juice. Automatic doors no longer swing open; there is an employee with a mask letting one customer in as soon another walks out.

She says good morning to everyone, but the tone of her voice says something else — probably it’s not going to be a good morning and not even a good day. Just another day in this bubble, without your mother’s jars of eggplants in the cellar.

I am Emiliano Ponzi. I’m an illustrator and author who lives in Milan, a place lately described as the wealthy economic engine of our country and a place also lately unrecognizable to me and my fellow Italians.

The escalation of infections in our country from the novel coronavirus forced our government to severely restrict our personal freedoms. It is a plan to save 60 million of us by pushing us apart. It is as if we have been suddenly cast in some surreal movie that affects our daily routine, the way we relate to other people and our interior dialogues. Each day, a small but startling bite of our personal freedoms.

Right now, I’m in my studio. It’s 7:34 a.m., and I have this impulse to stand up and go to the coffee shop around the corner, where every morning I eat a handmade chocolate croissant still warm. Habits are hard to kill.

[These simulations show how to flatten the coronavirus growth curve]

But all the coffee shops and restaurants were forced to close yesterday. The whole country of 60 million went to “Red Zone” on March 9, locked down to the outside, prohibited from travel between cities. By March 12, when 1,266 already had died and more than 17,000 already were infected, daily life shut down, and people were told to stay at home.

None of this is in our nature as Italians, as humans. “I have been thinking of what my friend Umberto, screenwriter of “The Great Beauty,” a 2014 Academy Award-winning movie, told me about how screenwriting had changed.

“We don’t write in advance all scenes as we used to,” he said. Now “we write the scenes as we shoot them … in order to have a more dynamic film.”

This column is an illustrated chronicle of Italy now, sketches and observations about the good actors we need to become as we improvise the new screenplay being written each day.

Australia and Germany followed with similar announcements Monday, and other countries, such as the United States, Britain, Brazil, ­Norway and Slovenia, either urged a postponement or said conditions must improve if they're to participate.

On Monday night, the United States' Olympic governing body issued its strongest statement to date, a gentle vote for postponement. In a joint statement, U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee chair Susanne Lyons and USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland said that after polling 1,780 athletes, the USOPC had reached the conclusion that postponement was the best option.

The USOPC said 68 percent of the athletes it surveyed did not think the Games could be fairly competed this summer, and 65 percent said their training has been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

""Even if the current significant health concerns could be alleviated by late summer, the enormous disruptions to the training environment, doping controls and qualification process can't be overcome in a satisfactory manner,"" Lyons and Hirshland said in the statement. ""To that end, it's more clear than ever that the path toward postponement is the most promising, and we encourage the IOC to take all needed steps to ensure the Games can be conducted under safe and fair conditions for all competitors.""

Earlier Monday, Dick Pound, the longest-serving IOC board member, told USA Today that ""postponement has been decided,"" but the IOC has given no indication that a delay was certain. In a request to comment on Pound's assertion, an IOC spokesman said, ""It is the right of every IOC Member to interpret the decision of the IOC [executive board] which was ­announced yesterday.""

Pound is one of 100 IOC members, having joined the committee in 1978. He is not one of the 15 members of the IOC's powerful executive board, which plays a pivotal role in all important Olympic matters.

Aruban IOC executive board member Nicole Hoevertsz said in an email Monday afternoon that the board ""discussed and took a decision about"" postponement Sunday, signaling the IOC had not changed its stance. She then pointed to the portion of the IOC's official statement that said it would start discussions about postponement scenarios and was confident those discussions would be completed within four weeks. A postponement of any length would involve many complexities, with global and local ramifications on athletes and residents, sponsors and television networks.

AD

AD

Pound did not return messages Monday. He did speak to the ­Canadian Press, striking a less-definitive tone.

""You're looking at a postponement,"" Pound said. ""I think that's out there now. . . . We're all reading the tea leaves and so on, but the Japanese themselves are talking about postponing. A lot of national Olympic committees and countries are calling for a postponement.""

Until Monday, Japan had insisted that the Games must go ahead as scheduled, although Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said last week that the priority must be to hold the Olympics in a “complete manner.” On Monday, he told parliament this might mean the dates would have to change.

AD

“If that is difficult, we would have no choice but to decide to postpone, with athletes as the first priority,” Abe said, underlining that an outright cancellation is not an option.

AD

Later Monday, Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee President Yoshiro Mori acknowledged it was time to consider alternatives.

“What we are going to do before anything else is to start by simulating about whether we postpone one month, three months, five months, one year,” Mori said. “We need to make a simulation about the various ­scenarios.”

Japan Olympics Minister Seiko Hashimoto said she was “glad to hear” that the IOC was not considering canceling the Games, and Mori said the IOC and Japan would like to “closely examine” the various scenarios.

AD

For athletes, ambiguity regarding postponement has led to frustration. They have continued to train as facilities have shuttered and governments have imposed restrictions. Over the weekend, USA Swimming and USA Track and Field called for the Games to be postponed, with USA Swimming specifically asking for a delay until 2021. Both federations cited protecting athletes’ physical and mental health. USA Gymnastics joined them Monday after polling athletes over the weekend. Sebastian Coe, head of World Athletics, the international governing body for track and field, responded to Bach’s letter Sunday by writing to him and saying the current schedule is “neither ­feasible nor desirable.”

AD

Germany on Monday became the latest country to announce that it would not send athletes to Tokyo this summer. Michael Schirp, a spokesman for the German team, said about 200 German athletes participated in a teleconference Saturday evening with the country’s top Olympic officials to voice their concerns. They were given a survey to complete, gauging their willingness to compete this summer. Their feelings were supposed to guide the German response, Schirp said, but after the IOC said a decision could take another four weeks, Alfons Hörmann, head of Germany’s Olympic committee, decided he had to act sooner.

Britain subsequently joined the chorus.

AD

“If the virus continues as predicted by the Government, I don’t think there is any way we can send a team,” British Olympic Association chair Hugh Robertson told Sky Sports.

AD

Beyond determining what is feasible from a public health standpoint, postponement would be an enormously complicated undertaking.

For each scenario, organizers would have to work out whether they could still secure the Olympic venues for all 33 sports, as well as for the Paralympics, and what the costs would be. There are also doubts about the availability of some sites, including the Olympic Village, where hundreds of apartments have been sold by a consortium of real estate developers for occupancy after the Games had been scheduled to conclude Aug. 9, and the planned media headquarters at Tokyo Big Sight, a tightly booked conference center.

AD

“We have to go through each of them one by one,” Mori said. “Considering just these things alone would take an enormous time.”

Mori hinted that organizers would prefer to keep the Olympics within this calendar year when he said, “We are 2020, so that is the direction for now.”

AD

For athletes, the length of a delay would alter drastically who is able to qualify or excel, with wide varieties depending on the sport. A long delay could mean some aging veterans miss the chance at a final Olympics. Some athletes, particularly female gymnasts, have small windows during which they are the best in the world and might prefer to compete closer to the time at which they had been preparing to peak.

NBC executives also have been in conversation with Olympic officials, and their wishes carry weight. More than 70 percent of the IOC’s nearly $6 billion from the current four-year Olympic cycle comes from TV revenue. Of that, NBC and parent company Comcast pay around half of it.

One former NBC executive believed the company would be satisfied with postponing the Games exactly a year. A shorter postponement — into the fall of this year, for instance, would force the Olympics to compete with football and a number of other events that already have been pushed from this spring, such as the Masters golf tournament.

For now, organizers say they will push ahead with the torch relay, which is set to start Thursday in Fukushima in northeastern Japan and is meant to symbolize Japan’s recovery from a 2011 tsunami and nuclear accident in the area. Mori said the prime minister was unsure whether he would attend the start of the relay — the government wanted to discourage crowds forming — although Mori said he himself would attend.

Mori acknowledged the relay route may need to be modified and said organizers were studying how it should be held given the fast-changing situation with the virus.

Tens of thousands flocked to a stadium in Sendai north of Tokyo to see the Olympic flame burning in a cauldron over the weekend after it arrived from Greece.

“We had a turnout nearly 10 times that we had estimated,” ­Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto said.

Muto said organizers should be happy with the turnout “in and of itself” but had placed risk as their top priority and had changed arrangements so people simply passed by the flame without a crowd forming."

At least 21 inmates in New York City jails have tested positive for the coronavirus, some of them at Rikers Island, the agency that oversees the city’s jails said Saturday.

In a letter sent to prosecutors and jail officials, the Board of Correction also said 12 corrections employees and five correctional health services workers were diagnosed in the past week.

Another 58 other people were being monitored in the contagious disease and quarantine units, the board’s interim chair, Jacqueline Sherman, wrote.

Sherman said the situation left city jails “facing a crisis” and called on law enforcement officials to release high-risk inmates as soon as possible.

“It is likely these people have been in hundreds of housing areas and common areas over recent weeks and have been in close contact with many other people in custody and staff,” she said. Given the crowded conditions in jails, she said, the number of patients “is certain to rise exponentially.”

Sherman urged officials to rapidly decrease the jail population, prioritizing people at high risk of infection such as those over 50 or people with underlying health conditions.

People detained for administrative reasons such as parole violations should be released first, she wrote, along with people serving less than one year.

“Fewer people in the jails will save lives and minimize transmission among people in custody as well as staff,” Sherman said. “Failure to drastically reduce the jail population threatens to overwhelm the City jails’ health care system as well its basic operations.”

The Department of Corrections confirmed the 12 infections among its employees but gave a slightly lower number, 19, for the total number of people in custody who have tested positive. The department didn’t immediately respond to a request to clarify the discrepancy."

In a time of crisis, such action is vital. But some leaders also appear to be exploiting the pandemic for their own political ends.

Crisis management, like war, is politics by other means. The most glaring example of this right now may be in Israel. Last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a pliant Justice Ministry postpone his arraignment on corruption charges, while coronavirus-induced emergency decrees have interrupted the formation of Israel’s new government after elections this month. The absence of a functional government has prevented the country’s newly elected parliament from pushing through legislation that could prevent an indicted politician like him from becoming prime minister.

Meanwhile, Netanyahu is playing up his role as commander in chief, staging daily national security briefings alongside allies. “If Trump’s aim is to rally his voters for the upcoming election, Netanyahu’s is to make opposition voters forget the results of the previous one,” wrote Bernard Avishai in the New Yorker.

“Netanyahu, who, for the past ten years, has severely underfunded hospitals, doctors’ salaries, and medical education, has largely succeeded in escaping such criticism by flaunting his mastery of the stringent guidelines imposed by the health bureaucracy,” he added.

Talks to forge a unity government have so far stalled. The prime minister and his colleagues “have shut down parliament, enacted extreme ‘security’ measures without legislative oversight and shelved the courts just as Netanyahu was about to go on trial for corruption,” wrote Israeli commentator Gershom Gorenberg for The Washington Post. “I don’t use the word ‘coup’ lightly. But any weaker description of Netanyahu’s assault on Israeli democracy is a refusal to absorb and report the truth.”

AD

An illiberal ally of the Israeli leader, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, is also exercising new coronavirus-enabled powers. After spending days linking the contagion to illegal migration, Orban and his nationalist government extended an emergency law with new provisions that could potentially be used to criminalize critical press. “Orban would be allowed to announce steps to contain the pandemic via decrees until the government no longer sees it as necessary, according to the draft legislation published on the parliament website late Friday,” noted Bloomberg News. “Promoting false information that hinders authorities’ efforts would carry a prison term of as long as five years.”

Critics warned that this was just the latest subversion in Orban’s decade-long takeover of the country’s democratic system. “Step by step, the governing majority extinguished the professional, organizational, and financial autonomy of public institutions, while putting such control mechanisms in place that ensure the prime minister’s decision making power in all significant policy areas,” wrote David Vig, director of Amnesty International in Hungary.

And the United States isn’t immune, either. President Trump’s Department of Justice is reportedly seeking expanded emergency powers, including provisions for judges to have the power to detain people indefinitely. It’s unlikely to be accepted by Congress.

Though public health concerns remain paramount, analysts are increasingly warning about the risk of the erosion of the rule of law. “These crises are risky for democracies more than anything,” political scientist Erica Frantz told Britain’s Independent. “I see these crises as opportunities for governments to crack down. We really need to pay attention to crisis events that can be used for transitions from democracy to take place.”

In a letter issued last week, a group of U.N. human rights experts and special rapporteurs issued a reminder to governments “that any emergency responses to the coronavirus must be proportionate, necessary and non-discriminatory.”"

New York is one of a handful of states to order a sweeping shutdown.

Responding to a public demand from New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D), Trump said he would authorize federal action on four temporary hospital sites, with 250 beds each to start. Trump said he has ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ship mobile hospital centers to New York, as well as California and the state of Washington.

Earlier in the day, Cuomo said the state is doing everything it can to get necessary supplies and hospital beds, but the federal government has powers he does not, and he called on the White House to act quickly.

“Get the Army Corps of Engineers moving. Get FEMA moving. Let’s get those buildings up,” Cuomo said in a Sunday news conference. “Time matters. Minutes count. And this is literally a matter of life and death. We get the facilities up, we get the supplies, we will save lives. If we don’t, we will lose lives.”

Cuomo wants temporary hospitals at locations in Long Island, Westchester and Manhattan’s Javits Center, a giant convention hall.

“From my point of view, construction could start tomorrow,” he said. “There is no red tape on the side of New York.”

AD

New York wants new hospital capacity urgently, because the rapid growth of cases suggest the state may need 110,000 beds. It currently has only about 53,000.

AD

As of Sunday, more than 15,000 New Yorkers had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, and about 2,000 of them have required hospitalization. Of those confirmed cases, nearly 11,000 were in New York City, where nearly 1,800 are hospitalized.

Cuomo also wants the president to use the Defense Production Act to “take over that function of contracting and supplying all of the supplies we need.”

The problem, Cuomo said, is the demand for masks and other gear is so high, states and other government agencies are bidding up the prices to nearly 10 times their normal cost. If the federal government stepped in, that would end the bidding wars and create some order in the marketplace.

AD

“Price gouging is a tremendous problem and it’s only getting worse,” Cuomo said. “There are masks that we were paying 85 cents for, we’re now paying seven dollars. Why? Because I’m competing against every other state, and in some cases, against other countries around the world.” He added that a similar difficulty exists in the market for ventilators to treat the most ill coronavirus patients.

AD

“This is just an impossible situation to manage. If we don’t get the equipment, we can lose lives that we can otherwise save if we had the right equipment,” said the governor, who has already tried to convince area garment manufacturers to retool their production lines to make masks.

To try to stave off the spread of coronavirus, New York is one of a handful of states that have taken the drastic step of ordering all nonessential business to shut down. The order was to take effect at 8 p.m. Sunday. Some types of commerce, such as medical care and supplies, food production and distribution, and paper supplies are exempt from the order as essential activities. Businesses may be fined if they violate the governor’s order, but there are currently no such fines for individuals. People are advised to stay inside as much as possible, but officials have also encouraged solitary exercise, such as running or hiking, as long as people stay a safe distance from each other.

AD

As he has done repeatedly in recent days, Cuomo complained at length about the number of people, particularly young people, who were ignoring the orders and advice to keep their distance from each other, and playing basketball in public parks or otherwise hanging out in close proximity to each other.

AD

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said NYPD officers would be instructed to disperse gatherings of people in parks if they were not keeping a safe distance from each other.

“If they see anything that looks like even the beginning of a gathering, they are going to say break it up,” de Blasio said. “The message couldn’t be clearer.”

Sunday morning church services were largely nonexistent in New York, as Grace Church in the West Village rang its bells but kept its doors locked. Worshipers were invited to watch a live stream of services hosted by another Manhattan church.

AD

Our Lady of Pompeii Church in Lower Manhattan was open, but had just two worshipers inside, each wearing masks and sitting on opposite sides of the pews.

“Oh, a church is open! It’s so hard to find a church that’s open,” said Irene Venditti, 69, as she passed by. “God’s always with us,” she said. “It’s nice to be here, but I don’t need to be here to be with God.”

Also Sunday, a number of New York-area lawmakers, including House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D) urged the Justice Department to find ways to let more defendants out of federal jails in the city, after the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn had its first detainee test positive. Defense lawyers and other advocates have warned that the nation’s prison and jail population are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of coronavirus.

Around New York City, local businesses and residents grappled this weekend with such a sweeping, open-ended order.

In Queens, many businesses were already shuttered Sunday, and the few that were open tried to drum up enough business to pay the bills.

At the 51st Baker & Cafe, owner Jonathan Stirling said he understood the reasons for the government order, but the effects on his business were painful.

“This is so beyond what I’ve had to deal with,” Stirling said. He’s already reduced the cafe’s hours and was making deliveries himself. “If it continues like this we can pay the payroll for this skeleton staff,” he said.

In Manhattan, Nadov Cohen spent Saturday night working at Tabouleh, a casual restaurant he owns in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood. By dinnertime, he’d logged just $79.20 in sales, compared to the $1,500 or more he’d make on a typical night before the pandemic.

Cohen, who already had to let his entire staff go, does not think his business will survive, in part because the business depends on the theater crowd and tourists.

He said he is still going to work not to feed the few remaining customers, but for his kids."

The grim harbinger of how bad things could get lies right in Europe’s midst, as Italy’s death toll leaps by hundreds each day. Doctors there are struggling to keep more than 2,800 people in intensive care alive, an effort that requires staff, beds and a constant supply of protective equipment.

But countries are competing against one another for medical supplies on an international market that has been sucked dry. To address shortages, Spanish clothes manufacturers are turning their lines to making medical masks, and Parisian perfumers are producing hand sanitizer in an effort that harks back to wartime.

As the number of critically ill rises, analysts expect even the continent’s best prepared health systems to be stretched to their limits.

“There’s been nothing on this scale in the postwar period,” said Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “The problem is that health systems, we talk about them as adaptive, but they have the capacity to fall over. They can expand so much, but at some point, the whole thing collapses.”

Some countries began preparations earlier than others, but by now, the scale of the crisis has set in across the continent. In Britain, which was particularly slow to act, government pronouncements are now accompanied by a palpable sense of panic and ever more desperate appeals. The mood in France has shifted from an initial nonchalance to heightened anxiety, as President Emmanuel Macron has imposed an increasingly strict lockdown period of 15 days, which officials have suggested may be extended.

Spain, which has suffered Europe’s second-worst outbreak after Italy, opened a coronavirus hospital in a 359-room hotel last week. Authorities say they expect to convert as many as 4,000 hotel beds to hospital beds and add 5,500 more in a convention center.

In the race to respond to the virus, countries in Europe do not begin on an even footing. Germany has 6 acute care beds per 1,000 people, according to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data, nearly three times as many as in Britain, with about 2.1. France has 3.1, according to the OECD; Spain has 2.4.

The number of acute care beds includes all those for curative purposes. The organization does not give data for the number of intensive care beds, but Germany has 28,000, around 25,000 of which are equipped with ventilators. Berlin has ordered 10,000 more from a German medical manufacturer. Britain’s National Health Service has only 8,000. The government last week asked automakers such as Jaguar to try to quickly manufacturer them. The NHS wants 20,000 to 30,000 more.

AD

AD

But the exponential growth in cases in many countries is concerning to even the best prepared. German Health Minister Jens Spahn is offering financial bonuses for hospitals to add intensive care beds. In a letter to hospitals this month, he asked managers to free up beds by postponing nonessential surgery “now” — using boldface type.

Reinhard Busse, head of the department of health-care management at the Berlin University of Technology, predicted pressure on the German health system would grow.

“Clearly when the number of ICU patients also goes up exponentially, even though we have more beds than anywhere else, obviously there will be a shortage,” he said.

AD

Some analysts say one advantage Europe has is centralized, socialized systems that may be easier to reorganize and adapt to changing needs. By comparison, some U.S. hospitals have said they might have to close if they do not receive financial relief.

AD

Spain and Britain have announced they will take over private hospitals. Britain’s deal to take over private health care adds 8,000 hospital beds, 1,200 ventilators and more than 250 operating-theater and ICU beds. It also adds almost 20,000 health-care professionals, including 10,000 nurses and 700 doctors, who will pivot to providing care for coronavirus patients.

In Spain, the deal adds 1,172 intensive care beds, according to the Ministry of Health. Public hospitals have 4,627.

France, which has about 5,000 intensive care beds with ventilators for its 66 million people, is trying to secure more through a jointly negotiated European Union initiative.

Just getting basic medical supplies such as masks and gloves remains a challenge. Some 4,000 health-care workers in Britain sent an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson decrying an “unacceptable shortage” of medical equipment. An Italian doctor who died after developing covid-19, the disease the virus causes, said in a television interview that doctors in his hospital had to work without gloves.

A glance at public tenders is a window into the desperation. The French Interior Ministry is offering 15 million euros for 1.5 million liters of hand-sanitizing gel, one tender shows. Italy’s region of Veneto, one of the first struck by the coronavirus, wants 250,000 liters of the coveted liquid, 50,000 testing swabs and a half-million face masks. Luxembourg is looking for 61,000 respiratory masks with “extreme urgency.”

Wartime-like efforts to make up shortages have brought surges in national solidarity. But the panic over the coronavirus also, initially at least, brought an air of everyone for themselves to the continent.

Italy has complained that its European brethren have been slow to step in to assist, forcing it to turn to China instead.

AD

“Italy needs tens of millions of face masks,” Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said.

AD

“One-hundred-million face masks will be arriving from China,” he said. “Should other countries want to help us out in this war, they’re welcome to. Our country is on the front lines.”

Central European and Balkan states have also turned to Beijing for help, and on Saturday, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic tweeted his appreciation.

“Thank you very much to my brother, President Xi Jinping, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people. Long live our steel friendship!” he wrote.

Elias Mossialos, head of the Department of Health Policy at the London School of Economics, predicted the number of countries “knocking on China’s door” will give Beijing’s soft power a boost.

“There is no European solidarity,” he said.

In an effort to build some, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last week announced a common European medical reserve that will include a stockpile of ventilators, protective equipment and other items. She had criticized earlier bans on medical exports from France and Germany.

In a glimmer of European collaboration, hospitals in France’s Alsace region have begun transferring some critically ill patients across the border to Germany, where the state of Baden-Württemberg offered assistance.

Whatever the preparations in hospitals, analysts say, a key in how well health services cope will be how effectively earlier measures on distancing and containment have been in “flattening the curve,” or slowing the spread of infection to avoid overwhelming the systems. There are early indications that levels of intensive care admissions in Germany will be lower than in Italy, Busse of the Berlin University of Technology said, but data is incomplete and affected by varying levels of testing.

Germany, where the death rate is notably lower than elsewhere, could be seeing the benefit of tracking and containing its early clusters, epidemiologists say. But it was slower than some countries to ban mass events and has refrained from a total lockdown. On Sunday, it limited nonfamily social gatherings to two people.

Health authorities in Austria, which enacted tighter restrictions earlier, said they were beginning to see the impact as the growth rate of new infections in the country slows. Britain, meanwhile, has held back from implementing the stricter measures seen elsewhere.

“The question is now, is it too late for the U.K.?” Mossialos said. “Now they are panicking, big time.”

A group of British scientists reported that it would take just 2.5 percent of the British population to be infected to cause a bed shortage in most counties. If infections reach 10 percent, the group said, the country would see “hospital deserts.”

One Spanish doctor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not have permission to talk to the media, lamented that his country had wasted valuable time. He said his hospital now looked like a “wartime clinic.”

Now, in 2020, as a deadly coronavirus that causes the disease known as covid-19 spreads across the world, Dr. Chen is back in the limelight.

AD

It’s the real Dr. Chen: Chen Wei, a major general in the People’s Liberation Army and the virologist who leads the Institute of Bioengineering at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences.



AD

State media this month have run photos of Chen, in fatigues and a surgical mask, standing in front of a Communist Party flag and receiving an injection in her left arm. The substance was, according to the reports, one that China hopes will become the first vaccine against the coronavirus. Seven other military officers reportedly received the jab.

“The virus is ruthless, but we believe in miracles,” Chen told local media. “The epidemic is a military situation, and the epidemic area is the battlefield.”

AD

Chen was authorized to start a clinical trial for her vaccine on Monday, state broadcaster CCTV reported last week — on the day that a clinical trial began at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle, funded by the National Institutes of Health.

The quest for a vaccine is not only about public health, but also about the fight between China and the United States for supremacy in trade and technology, the military and the media — and now, a virus.

AD

Chinese leaders are spurring their scientists to become the first to develop a breakthrough against the coronavirus, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has infected more than 329,000 people worldwide.

AD

Chinese leader Xi Jinping said a “whole-nation” scientific and technological effort was needed to counter the outbreak.

“We should build a new type of ‘whole-nation system’ to make breakthroughs in critical and core technologies,” Xi said in an article published last week in the Communist Party magazine Qiushi Journal. Major scientific achievements, he said, were “a vital component of the national strategic system.”

China wants to rewrite its role in the coronavirus story from source to savior, to show — as Chen herself said — that it is living up to its “responsibilities as a great power and its contribution to humankind.”

But it also wants to show China’s scientific prowess at a time of increasing competition in almost every endeavor.

“We must be aware that the development of a vaccine is a battle that China cannot afford to lose,” commentator Mu Lu wrote in the nationalistic Global Times newspaper this week, calling it “life-and-death.”

AD

AD

Chen, for one, appears conscious that she’s in a race, saying her efforts would be no slower than the 12-week time frame that President Trump set for American researchers.

CanSino Biologics, a company based in Tianjin that is working with Chen, said Tuesday that it’s looking for volunteers to test its vaccine, a genetically engineered recombinant adenovirus vector labeled “Ad5-nCoV.”

Chen, 54, is credited in China with developing a nasal spray that helped protect health-care workers against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and with making significant contributions to treating Ebola during the 2014-16 outbreak.

She went to Wuhan on Jan. 26, days after the government conceded the virus could be transmitted between people, and has since been working at the Wuhan Institute of Virology to develop a vaccine.

AD

AD

State media have lauded her efforts as the most promising among nine possible treatments that Chinese scientists are developing.

One Shanghai-based researcher, Xu Jianqing, has given himself a shot of a vaccine he first tested in mice and monkeys. But he has said that, unlike with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, the host and the pathway of the novel coronavirus remain unclear, hampering vaccine development.

Scientists say the coronavirus is most likely to have begun in bats and then jumped to an intermediate carrier, perhaps pangolins, before mutating into a form that humans could catch.



Chen has said the earliest her team can start clinical trials is April. But there’s little detail about what trials have begun — and whether Chen received her own vaccine.

AD

Commentators have expressed skepticism online, suggesting that the photo showing her receiving an injection was dated and doubting that a rapid solution was possible.

AD

Leo Poon, professor of public health laboratory sciences at Hong Kong University, said viewing the development of a vaccine as a competition is the wrong approach.

“It’s always good to have multiple vaccines being developed at the same time so that we have options and can see which one is best,” he said. “Determining whether vaccines are safe to use takes quite a lot of effort. . . . You can’t just vaccinate 10 people and say that it’s safe.”

Even with seasonal flu prevention, Poon noted, it took about six months to develop a vaccine against the H1N1 strain in 2009.

AD

Relations between the world’s two largest economies are plumbing new depths.

After a tentative trade deal was signed Jan. 15, analysts such as Carla Freeman, U.S.-China chair at the Library of Congress, hoped the United States and China had overcome a key area of dispute and could now work together on issues of common concern, such as North Korea.

AD

But those hopes withered as the severity of the coronavirus became known, prompting tensions that only worsened as Trump continued to call it the “Chinese virus” and Chinese diplomats openly suggested biological warfare by American soldiers.

As the friction has increased, each side has expelled the other’s journalists in tit-for-tat retaliation.

AD

“There is a huge amount at stake,” Freeman said. She noted that the tensions could spur China to divert or restrict sales of supplies such as protective gear for medical personnel and the active ingredients in prescription medicines, including antibiotics.

“This crisis might have been an opportunity for the U.S. and China to push the reset button on their relationship,” she said. “Unfortunately, amid politics on both sides, that opportunity appears lost.”

Israel has reported 945 coronavirus infections. Even was the first to die; the Ministry of Health said more than 15 other cases remained critical. The government has sealed the country’s borders and ordered its 8.7 million residents to remain in their homes for all but essential activity.

Even was born in Budapest. In 1941, his father was taken to a Hungarian army labor camp and then to the Mauthausen concentration camp, according to Yad Vashem, Israel’s official Holocaust memorial and research center. Even, his mother and brother were evicted from the family home. They found shelter in a house protected by Swiss diplomats; they changed locations in darkness. The next day, his grandfather was shot, records show; his body was dumped in the Danube.

Even eventually moved to Israel with help from a Jewish youth immigration group. He went on to a career as a civil servant and was posted to a succession of overseas missions with his wife, Yona, the daily Ha’aretz reported. She died in 2012.

Long retired, Even was one of at least six residents of an assisted-living facility in Jerusalem who might have contracted the virus from an infected social worker, the Jerusalem Post reported. The manager of the facility said the remaining residents were self-isolating in their apartments.

Even was taken last week to a special coronavirus treatment ward at the city’s Shaare Zedek Medical Center. He suffered underlying health conditions, according to media reports, and was in serious condition.

The virus is known to be especially dangerous to older people and those with underlying health problems.

Rachel Gemara, an oncology nurse who volunteered to treat Even and other covid-19 patients in the ward, described the difficulties of delivering care to the infected to the Jewish Journal. Most treatments are delivered remotely, she said; practitioners stay behind protective shields. Much of the communication is by video.

Gemara, 32, said the younger, healthier patients in the 20-bed ward have helped care for the older, more seriously affected ones, fluffing their pillows, adjusting their oxygen masks, helping them call their families.

“They’re angels,” Gemara said. “It’s heartwarming to watch.”

The 40 staffers in the ward are volunteers, she said.

Israel, which had one of the highest hospital occupancy rates among developed countries before the outbreak, is straining to keep the pandemic from overwhelming its supply of practitioners and equipment. More than 1,700 doctors and nurses are in quarantine over possible exposure to the virus, the health ministry said Saturday. More than 40 have tested positive for the virus.

AD

The Canadian-born Gemara detailed new protocols for the handling of covid-19 fatalities to curtail the further spread of the infection in a Facebook post.

AD

Despite the sterile setting, she said, Even’s final hours Friday night were a time of touching compassion.

“In the unit, we were in awe as we watched the other patients care for you,” she wrote. “They so badly did not want you ever to feel alone.”

Two patients were with Even in his last moment, she said. They placed their hands on his eyes and said the Shema, a traditional prayer at the end of life."

Most reentered Pakistan via a single border crossing in Baluchistan province. A similar problem is affecting next-door Afghanistan, where tens of thousands of refugees have recently flooded back from Iran.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, facing public panic, has stopped short of declaring a nationwide lockdown but has asked all citizens to self-quarantine for two weeks. This past week, Khan came under strong criticism after playing down the threat in a nationwide address. He said that people should not “run to hospitals” to get tested and that 90 percent of those testing positive would “recover easily.”

AD

AD

On Friday, with several hundred new cases reported, Khan told a group of TV anchors that he hoped the coming of hot and dry weather would mitigate the outbreak. He urged people to stay at home but remain calm, saying that “panicking is more dangerous for us than coronavirus.” He said he was still reluctant to impose a nationwide lockdown because it would harm the working poor.

“We don’t want to try and save people from corona but they end up dying due to hunger and poverty,” Khan said. Pakistan, a Muslim-majority country of 210 million, has a high poverty rate, with about one-quarter of the populace earning less than $2 per day.

But in Sindh, a vast and impoverished region of close to 50 million, officials decided to impose a total lockdown beginning Sunday night. Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah was in discussions with army and police officials Sunday night and was expected to formally enlist their help to ensure public compliance with the lockdown.

AD

AD

“Time for some tough decisions,” Murtaza Wahab, the minister’s spokesman, said in a tweet early Sunday. He said security forces would probably be asked to “ensure full implementation” of the decision to keep people in their homes, while grocery stores and pharmacies will remain open.

But the leader of the Pakistan People’s Party, which is based in Sindh, said the country needs to impose a nationwide lockdown to prevent the virus from spreading further. In a tweet Saturday, Bilawal Bhutto said the decision had been delayed for too long.

“We do need to learn from the experiences of other countries,” he said in the tweet, noting that the unchecked virus could “overwhelm” the public health system. “While we are optimistic for a good outcome, at the same time, we should prepare for the worst.”

AD

In Punjab province, where nearly 100 cases of the coronavirus have been reported, officials announced a three-day lockdown, with all parks, malls and restaurants closed until Tuesday. Media outlets published photos of unarmed security forces guarding a new isolation facility in Lahore city. In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, a partial lockdown has also been instituted for the next three days, with all shopping malls and restaurants closed.

AD

The government decided Saturday to ban all international arriving flights for 14 days, but the national carrier, Pakistan International Airlines, was allowed to bring back several of its planes from abroad, including one from London carrying Shahbaz Sharif, the opposition leader from the Pakistan Muslim League (N). He has been in London visiting his ailing brother, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.

On Sunday, officials at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, the capital, said they were “aware” of reports from Pakistani health authorities that an unidentified embassy employee had been infected with the virus after landing at the international airport. They declined to provide further information, citing privacy reasons. Pakistani media reported that the individual was being treated in an isolation ward at the embassy.

AD

Pakistan’s army chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, ordered the army on Saturday to step up its assistance to civil authorities and urged all Pakistanis to take precautions to help curb the virus. The army is the most powerful institution in Pakistan, with a history of intervening in civilian power. Bajwa has emphasized his deference to civilian authority and desire to help in emergencies.

The army has said it will open all military hospitals and health facilities nationwide to assist in testing and treating virus cases.

Khan and his aides appealed to international financial institutions to write off loans to Pakistan and other developing countries to allow them to use more resources to fight the virus. Pakistan has a huge foreign debt, and Khan has struggled to implement economic austerity measures to bring it down.

Pakistan shares a border with China, and there is constant travel by workers, students and others between the two countries. A first, no Pakistani students were allowed to return after the virus broke out, and no cases were reported until Feb. 26, when a man in Karachi tested positive after returning from Iran.

Several days later, authorities began reporting a sharp surge in cases among pilgrims returning from Iran across the border at Taftan, Baluchistan, even after they had been held in quarantine there for 14 days. The three fatalities from the coronavirus as of Sunday night were pilgrims who returned from Iran or Saudi Arabia.

In the past several weeks, the rate of reported infections has risen sharply. As of Saturday, there were more than 290 confirmed cases in Sindh, more than 100 in Baluchistan, more than 150 in Punjab, 31 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 55 in Gilgit-Baltistan, 11 in Islamabad and one in Kashmir.

As of this weekend, health officials said a 3,000-room quarantine center has been set up in Multan, a city in Punjab, for infected pilgrims who returned from Iran. They said it has 171 isolation rooms. After screening there, patients will be sent to a new general hospital for treatment, they said."

In Egypt, tourist cancellations have reached 80%, while retail and hospitality sectors have also been hard-hit in countries like the United Arab Emirates where tourism is a pillar of the economy, according to the IMF.

The arrival of the global pandemic in Syria with one positive case, as well as in the Gaza Strip, has raised concerns the virus could run rampant in some of the most vulnerable areas in the Middle East. War-torn Libya and Yemen, which have yet to report any cases, are also a source of concern.

AD

The worst outbreak in the Mideast is unfolding in Iran, where authorities reported another 127 deaths on Monday, bringing the total number of fatalities to more than 1,800 amid more than 23,000 confirmed cases. The dead included the mother-in-law of the son of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the state-run IRNA news agency said.

Lines have formed outside grocery stores, banks and gas stations across the Syrian capital, Damascus, as people braced for wider closures. The government has already closed restaurants, cafes and other businesses, and has halted public transportation.

In Egypt’s Mediterranean city of Alexandria, dozens of people early Tuesday prayed to God for help against the virus. Online video showed people praying from their windows and balconies. Others showed some three dozen people marching in a side street and chanting: “There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his Messenger,” drawing criticism from people who said the demonstrators should have stayed at home.

AD

AD

Pompeo said the Trump administration would slash $1 billion in assistance to Afghanistan and reduce all cooperation unless Ghani and Abdullah agree on forming a new government. Speaking to reporters aboard his plane on the return flight home, Pompeo said he was hopeful the two rivals “will get their act together and we won’t have to” cut the assistance. “But we’re prepared to do that,” he said.

As part of the peace deal, rival factions in Afghanistan were to come together in all-Afghan talks about shaping the country’s future. However, Washington made clear from the start that the pace of a U.S. troop withdrawal is linked to the Taliban clamping down on terror groups and aiding in the fight against the militant Islamic State group — not on the success of intra-Afghan talks.

A senior Afghan official familiar with Pompeo’s discussions in Kabul said Monday there were no results but that efforts would continue. The official did not indicate a compromise was imminent. He spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak to reporters about the talks.

AD

AD

Ghani and Abdullah, his main rival in last September’s disputed presidential polls, have been waging a bitter power struggle that has seen both men declare themselves president in competing inauguration ceremonies earlier this month.

The offices of Ghani and Abdullah did not respond to questions Tuesday about their meetings with Pompeo and the threatened $1 billion aid cut.

After meeting the chief Taliban negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in Qatar, Pompeo told reporters he was satisfied the Taliban were keeping their side of the deal, had reduced violence and were ready to start negotiations with the leadership in Kabul.

In an English-language statement Tuesday, the Taliban said Baradar’s meeting with Pompeo stressed that only a strict implementation of the peace deal would “pave the way for intra-Afghan negotiations along with enduring peace and cease-fire, including a future Islamic government in accordance with the agreement.”

AD

AD

The statement also said Pompeo assured the Taliban that the U.S. forces’ withdrawal “will continue in accordance with the declared timetable.”

The squabbling in Kabul among the two Afghan rivals — both linked to powerful warlords, all with heavily armed militias — put a pall over the deal since the signing of the peace deal.

Ghani has also refused to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners the deal promised would be freed as a good-will gesture ahead of intra-Afghan talks. The Taliban for their part were to free 1,000 Afghan officials and military personnel they hold captive.

While the rest of the world struggles with the coronavirus pandemic, Afghans have vented their frustrations on social networks and local media over the government’s lack of action. Afghanistan has registered only 42 cases of the virus though there are fears the true figure could be far greater after more than 137,000 Afghans have returned since the start of the year from Iran, the scene of the Middle East’s largest outbreak. Many of the returnees visited the southern Herat province and later dispersed throughout Afghanistan with no follow-up or documentation, according to officials. Iran has had more than 1,800 deaths and over 23,000 infected with the virus.

AD

AD

Pompeo said that despite the threatened aid cuts, Washington remained committed to the Afghan people. As a demonstration of that, he said, the U.S. would provide $15 million in assistance to help Afghanistan fight the spread of the coronavirus.

The crisis there can be traced largely to a dayslong evangelical church gathering in Mulhouse attended by hundreds of people at the end of February.

AD

AD

In a sign of the devastating toll, the local newspaper in Mulhouse has had to add extra obituary pages as the deaths from the coronavirus increase — as has been done in some areas of Italy. In France, only the area around Paris had confirmed more cases than Grand Est as of Sunday, but the capital region has a population more than twice the size.

“Every day we have eight to 12 people who arrive. We don’t know what to do,” said Dr. Patrick Vogt, a general practitioner at the hospital in Mulhouse who recalled a shift just two weeks ago answering the city’s emergency hotline when call after call came in for respiratory problems.

In Germany, the states of Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Wuerttemberg have offered spare hospitals beds to treat French patients.

AD

The spokesman of Baden-Wuerttemberg state’s health ministry said the state would “naturally try to help our French neighbors,” and authorities have asked all hospitals with free capacity to take in French patients requiring ventilators.

AD

While Germany has many more confirmed virus cases than France, it has a much smaller number of deaths: 123, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, compared to France’s 860.

Today’s scenes in and around Mulhouse are sadly reminiscent of the bloodiest moments in the border region’s turbulent history. It was the stomping ground for armies in the 19th-century Franco-Prussian war and a site of intense battles during the 20th century’s two world wars, which included bitter territorial disputes over the Alsace region, now part of what’s called the Grand Est.

AD

The city was the site of France’s World War I opening attack against Germany in 1914’s Battle of Mulhouse, while bloody battles and burning villages tore it apart again during World War II as German and U.S. forces fought each other.

Regional health officials say that Grand Est is approximately one week ahead of the rest of France in terms of infection rates: As of Monday, according to French government data, the region had recorded nearly 4,300 cases in an area with around 5.5 million people. In contrast, the area around France’s capital of Paris, home to more than 12 million, had around 6,200 confirmed virus infections.

AD

The analysis serves as a deadly warning for France, a nation of 67 million that has already seen a dramatic lockdown, that the worst could be yet to come.

AD

In addition to the help offered from abroad, Mulhouse has drawn the focus of French President Emmanuel Macron, who ordered a field hospital to be built to help tend to the sick.

Around 50 soldiers have been putting up the structure that will have equipment usually used to make surgery possible in combat zones retrofitted to treat patients with the coronavirus. Authorities hope the five tents, each with six beds, could receive patients starting Monday.

About 100 military health personnel — anesthetists, nurses and nursing assistants — will be available to operate the field hospital.

In an unprecedented move during peacetime, the French army has also started evacuating critical coronavirus patients from the country’s east.

AD

AD

On Saturday, there was a new military airlift of patients hospitalized in Mulhouse. The first one took place last week.

“The epidemic is in full swing. The virus continues to spread. The patients keeping coming in serious condition,” said Vogt, the doctor in Mulhouse. “So far, there are no signs of hope.”

Now, he has another fear: How will those who work in the shadow of Everest make ends meet?

AD

The closure has significant financial ramifications for the local Sherpas, cooks, porters and others who make their living during the short climbing window.

AD

“I just feel bad,” said Apa Sherpa, who established a foundation to help Nepalese students with their education. “For everyone.”

Phurba Ongel was all set for spring work guiding western climbers to the 29,035-foot (8,850-meter) Everest summit when he heard the news nearly two weeks ago. He has already scaled Everest nine times and makes about $7,000 per season.

That was money he desperately needs for his two sons’ school, rent and groceries.

“Now,” Ongel said, “I don’t have much.”

Also losing money are clients, who dole out anywhere between $35,000 to $85,000 to be led up the mountain, and expedition operators who have expenses to pay despite the closure.

AD

“It is devastating for the tourism industry in Nepal and abroad,” said Lukas Furtenbach, a mountaineering guide and founder of Furtenbach Adventures. “Many businesses will not survive this.”

AD

China s hut down the northern route through Tibet due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 12. A day later, expeditions to the Nepal side were closed, too. Everest straddles the border between Nepal and China and can be climbed from both sides.

By shutting down the passage through the south route of Everest, the Nepal government stands to lose some $4 million in permits alone. There are thousands of people who depend on the money spent by climbers in Nepal.

“They have no income right now. Nothing,” Apa Sherpa said. “But the government made the right decision. The lives are more important.”

AD

According to Ang Tshering, a mountaineering expert in Nepal, the mountaineering industry brings in about $300,000 annually — and most of it during the spring climbing season that begins in March and ends in May.

AD

“The closure of the mountains has made thousands of people jobless in the mountaineering community,” Tshering said.

It’s setting up a potentially risky proposition in 2021 — overcrowding on the mountain. There will be a backlog of clients eager to make the trek, along with a new batch of climbers.

Last May, a climber snapped a memorable photo from a line with dozens of hikers in colorful winter gear that snaked into the sky. Climbers were crammed along a sharp-edged ridge above South Col, with a 7,000-foot (2,133-meter) drop on either side, all clipped onto a single line of rope, trudging toward the top of the world.

AD

“It would be very important that Nepal puts reasonable regulations in place for operators and climbers,” said Furtenbach, who resides in Austria and spends time at Lake Tahoe. “Otherwise, I see that risk for a total mess next year.”

AD

For the Sherpas, it’s about finding a way to hang on after their source of income was halted. They’re the backbone of an expedition — the first to reach Everest each climbing season and the last to leave. They set up the camps, carry the equipment and cook the food for climbing parties. They fix the ropes and ladders over the crevasses and ice-falls that enable mountaineers to scale the peak.

Generally, a Sherpa can earn $10,000 or more should they summit. Porters or cooks at the mountaineers’ camps average between $3,000 and $5,000 during their three months of work. That’s a significant amount compared with Nepal’s $1,035 annual per capita income.

AD

But it’s treacherous work.

That’s why Apa Sherpa started his foundation -- to give young kids another route.

Born into poverty and with a modest education, he had no choice but to climb. By the age of 12 he was working on climbing expeditions. At age 30, he summited Everest for the first time. He had earned the nickname “Super Sherpa” before retiring in 2011.

AD

His organization — the Apa Sherpa Foundation — attempts to provide hot meals to students at the Ghat School in the Khumbu region. It also pays the salary of six teachers in Thame and provides school supplies such as computers. He’s hoping to expand the foundation’s reach into other schools in Nepal.

AD

“If I’m still in Nepal, I have no choice. I would have to climb,” said Sherpa, who moved to the U.S. in 2006. “I have a choice here in America. I don’t have to take a risk. I’m just trying to help.”

The climbing community has seen an interruption on Everest before: An earthquake-triggered avalanche killed 19 at the base camp in 2015 and another avalanche over the dreaded Khumbu Icefall in 2014 killed 16 Nepali workers.

Apa Sherpa shuddered at the thought of anyone being at base camp in the midst of the coronavirus. He has plenty of family that still serve as mountain guides.

AD

For most people, COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, with the vast majority recovering in about two weeks. But anything respiratory can have dire consequence at base camp, where there are climbers scattered around in tents as they acclimate.

AD

“At high altitude our respiratory systems are incredibly distressed and challenged,” said Adrian Ballinger, t he founder of Alpenglow Expeditions. “We do know the coronavirus, which affects the respiratory system and can lead to pneumonia, would absolutely be much more serious and lead to potentially serious consequences and fatalities much more quickly at altitude.”

Ballinger had 11 clients scheduled for the summit team to the Tibet side of Everest, along with seven foreign mountain guides and 18 Sherpas.

He’s trying to lessen their financial hardships as best he can. Same with Garrett Madison, a guide based out of Seattle who was scheduled to lead his 14th Everest expedition.

AD

AD

“This is a tough time for sure. Thankfully we’ve saved up a rainy day fund to weather the storm,” Madison said. “With Everest canceled (our largest program of the year), as well as all other programs in jeopardy because of travel bans, we don’t know when we can resume normal operations of our programs.”

To celebrate recently turning 50, Graham Cooper of Piedmont, California, planned to summit Everest from the Tibet side with Ballinger. It was a bucket-list item for Cooper.

To prepare, he slept in an oxygen tent to simulate the thin air. He also ventured to Lake Tahoe, where he trained by hiking up the snow-packed slopes and skiing down.

Then, he received the text he was fearing: No trip. The mountain was closed.

Sure, he was disappointed. But he also understood.

“It’s not the end of the world,” Cooper said. “There’s always next year.”

Valley Springs Wireless Internet Service Provider WISP – Rural Internet Options

Looking for cost-effective rural internet options? Meet your new Valley Springs wireless internet service provider

When homesteaders and settlers moved across the United States prairie in the 19th century, they settled in places that rested near the burgeoning railway system.

As much as they loved the open prairie, they also knew they needed a connection to the world back east. The railroad was that connection.

Today’s reliable internet is that railroad. Where reliable internet exists, so will growing communities. Your rural community can survive and even thrive with a reliable internet connection.

The internet is the way to transport goods just as much as railroads, rivers, and airports of the past.

The Valley Springs community and outlying rural areas have viable and reliable rural internet options. You just need to know what’s out there before you move to L.A. for faster internet.

Keep reading to learn more about the wireless rural internet options available in the Valley Springs area.

Rural Internet Options: Satellite vs. Fixed Wireless

Before you understand your options, know the difference between fixed wireless and satellite internet connections.

Satellite and fixed wireless internet both need a dish or antenna affixed to a business or homeowner’s residence. Additionally, both will create a high-speed internet connection with no cables or physical lines going from source to router.

The biggest difference lies in distance, though.

Satellite and Atmospheric Interference

Satellite internet occurs when the provider uses a satellite approximately 20,000 feet in the atmosphere as a way to bounce a signal from the source to the consumer.

As a result, satellite internet is greatly affected by atmospheric disturbances. If the weather is bad, if a storm hits, the internet connection will turn spotty or disappear altogether.

The atmosphere does not affect fixed wireless, however.

Fixed Wireless Closer to the Ground

Fixed wireless occurs when a provider has a tower about the same height as a cell tower. The tower sends a signal usually no farther than ten miles but sometimes up to twenty miles to a consumer’s residence or business.

The aforementioned dish or antenna picks up the signal and sends it through a cable in the home to a router. The router then converts the signal into something the computer can read.

And you have the internet.

When you upload something, such as when you send an email out or put a post on Facebook, the process works the same except you’re sending it out to that tower rather than receiving it.

Because the tower rises usually no more than 500 feet above the ground, clouds, storms, and general atmospheric disturbances do not disrupt the signal.

Understanding Speed

Understand megabits per second as well when you look at internet speed. The term “mbps” or megabits per second refer to how fast your information will travel through the air and your cable.

So when you’re considering a lower internet speed, picture a horse and buggy moving on a low maintenance road versus a sleek, sportscar on the autobahn.

Also, realize that not everyone needs a sportscar at autobahn speeds, especially if the transport will cost you more than you can afford.

Viasat Satellite Connection

Viasat Internet, an international internet provider, provides high-speed internet for both home and business. Their speeds vary from 12 megabits per second to 50 megabits per second with the cost ranging from $50 a month to $100 a month.

Viasat also boasts of their service being available to 100 percent of the Valley Springs area. So you can get their service virtually anywhere in the Valley Springs area.

Hughes Net

Hughes Net is a well-known company that provides high-speed satellite internet to 100 percent of Valley Springs as well.

Their speeds all rest around 25 megabits per second. However, their prices vary according to the amount of data you will use.

You can spend $59.99 a month for 25 Mbps with 10 gigabytes of data on up to $149.99 a month for the same speed but with 50 gigabytes of data.

The amount of data you will need will vary depending on both the size and age of your household. A family with four school-age children who access the internet regularly for studies will have different needs than a retired widower who enjoys Netflix documentaries.

Calavares Internet

Do not let Calavares fool you. They do not just provide DSL, but fixed wireless also with download speeds up to 10 megabits per second. You can pay anywhere from $49.95 a month for 1.5 megabits per second on up to $79.95 for 6 megabits per second.

Calavares offers some sweet packages with fixed wireless internet, television, and home phone services.

Remotely Located

Cleverly named for its clients’ location, Remotely Located offers services specifically in El Dorado County, Amador County, and Calaveras County.

They vary their prices as well based on speed from $50 a month for 1.5 megabits per second to $300 a month for 20 megabits per second.

Installation costs will vary as well with the lowest at $200 and then moving to $300 for the “Extreme” and higher package that promises 6 megabits per second of download to 2 megabits per second of upload.

Remotely Located also promises to have towers no farther than 20 miles from your home compared to the 20,000-mile distance to a satellite.

Cal.net

Like its competitor, Cal.net packages range in speed and price. from $54.94 a month for 3.0 megabits of speed to $159.95 for 25 megabits per service.

Cal.net also has bundled packages that offer their customers phone service, giving them a nice little package for all their connection needs.

Additionally, Cal.net, unlike some of the other home internet services in the area, has no explicit data caps.

Know Your Options

When you understand your rural internet options, you can rest a little easier where you live.

Reliable internet isn’t about catching up with the latest gossip on Facebook. More now than ever employers are giving their employees the option to work from home. Most just need a reliable internet connection.

So if you want to have an amazing job and still enjoy the beauty of rural, northern California, you have some great options for reliable internet.

To learn more about random stuff relevant to those living in northern California, check out my blog.

You love living far from the grind of major city life. You also love having peace and beauty around you. But you hate not having reliable internet service.

Valley Springs is beautiful and it gives you an area where you can unwind or enjoy the peacefulness around you every day. But Valley Springs also has a technology gap in internet service providers.

To find the internet service provider you need we want to share some information about internet services in rural areas like Valley Springs. What you don’t know, may surprise you.

How to Get Internet in Rural Area

The world of rural internet with area provider services is much different than many of us are used to.

There are some crossover points which are the same regardless of what area or region you are in. They are;

Broadband internet services have limited penetration in some cases

In rural areas, you do not have a wide range of internet provider services to choose from

The internet’s connectivity in rural areas tend to work within an infrastructure which is old or not reliable

The FCC completed a broadband deployment report in late 2018. It stated there are 14 million people who live in rural areas within our country who still don’t have mobile LTE broadband at speeds of 10 Mbps/3Mbps.

Valley Springs has many areas where fiber, DSL or cable internet may not be available. What happens and what do you do?

That’s where we come in. We try to meet your technology need by providing you with the services which match it. Even if some of those services are in a different format than you are used to.

We are affordable. We work in an almost seamless fashion and we provide the technical functionality you need.

Rural Internet Service

Rural internet service is not for those who think life should be free of all hiccups. Rural internet service can be a stop and start system no matter who the provider is.

Internet service may also have less speed than you are used to. But it does work and meets all your internet service provider needs.

The best Valley Springs internet service can still have fluctuations sometimes. But that can happen in the inner city too. It depends on what is going on in and around the service provider.

One of the questions we ask our new customers and need to know is about their bandwidth needs.

It is important for your internet service provider to know if, for example, you are going to have two televisions and three computers needing service in your home or office.

Or maybe you have five televisions and seven computers which will need service in your home or office. The rule of thumb is the more devices, the more bandwidth you need.

Where are the Big Internet Service Provider Companies?

There are many new rural residents who want to know where are the internet service providers?

Sometimes it is difficult for them to understand why there are not more internet providers in rural areas.

In 2018 it was estimated there were about 2,000 companies providing fixed wireless broadband access across all 50 states. Those companies on average served 1,200 customers each.

It’s at least part of the solution for rural areas. But there are still millions of rural residents in the United States who do not have any internet connectivity options at all. Many of those residents won’t be serviced anytime too soon.

Because big internet service companies who can give rural residents the most in connectivity, provide it the least in those areas. It’s called the connectivity gap.

Lawmakers have special committees studying the issue this very minute. But they, like the big internet companies, may not have answers to suit your needs anytime real soon.

Internet Service Provider

There is an internet service provider who can give you what you need at affordable rates. We found out that sometimes when you live in a rural area you have to take the bulls by the horn and figure it out yourself. That’s what we did.

We figured out what we needed, when we needed it and made it happen. That’s how you can get things done sometimes in rural America.

Valley Springs needed someone to bring reliable and affordable internet service to those in need and that’s what we created.

We offer Valley Springs wireless internet with 20mpbs upload and download speeds. We also have a maximum monthly data plan which is 20 gigs max in data.

We are the ideal solution which eliminates the gap of connectivity issue so many other rural areas have. If traditional cable companies and internet providers don’t or can’t serve you, we step in.

We make sure connectivity happens for you. No matter what you need the internet for we can make connectivity match your need.

We can bring the world to you while you are in your home or business far away from it all.

How Do I Get Connected?

We keep trying to make internet service progress in Valley Springs and other connectivity gap rural areas. But the differences in the haves and the have-nots in speed and quality keeps getting worse.

But for those in Valley Springs, if you want to get connected, reach out to us today. It doesn’t matter how far away you live from the nearest city or where you are at Valley Springs. We can make it happen.

With our internet service provider services, you can still stay relevant to the people, places, and events you prefer.

If you decide to leave everything else by the wayside, you can do that too. Because you live in the beautiful and peaceful Valley Springs.

You won’t even have to leave your swing on your front porch or the entertainment center in your living room. We bring an internet connection to you.

Conduct your business or interact with family and friends. But to get there you need to contact us. We will let you know why we are the best internet service provider option in Valley Springs.

Our internet services merge the best of two worlds. Connectivity on your terms and only when you want it."

The Kremlin said the two leaders had spoken by phone at Washington’s initiative, hours after Putin ordered the Russian army to help firefighters battle the wildfires.

The fires have spread to around 3 million hectares of mostly remote forest, an area almost the size of Belgium, according to the Federal Forestry Agency, wafting smoke across Siberia and prompting several regions to declare states of emergency.

“The U.S. president offered Russia cooperation in fighting forest fires in Siberia,” the Kremlin statement said.

“President Putin expressed his sincere gratitude for such an attentive attitude and for the offer of help and support.”

Putin told Trump that Moscow would take him up on his offer if necessary, the Kremlin said, adding: “The Russian president took this step from the U.S. president as a sign that in the future we can restore full-scale ties between our two countries.”

Russia has long been keen to try to start rebuilding battered U.S.-Russia relations, which remain strained by everything from Syria to Ukraine and allegations of Russian interference in U.S. politics, which Moscow denies.

The two leaders agreed to continue their contacts over the phone and in face-to-face meetings, the Kremlin said.

The letter is based on climate science that was first established in 1979 at the first World Climate Conference held in Geneva. For decades multiple global bodies have agreed urgent action is needed but greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise.

“Despite 40 years of major global negotiations, we have continued to conduct business as usual and have failed to address this crisis,” said William Ripple, professor of ecology at Oregon State University, who spearheaded the letter.

“Climate change has arrived and is accelerating faster than many scientists expected,” according to the letter published in BioScience.

Researchers say they have a moral obligation to “clearly warn humanity of any catastrophic threat” and “tell it like it is”. “Clearly and unequivocally planet Earth is facing a climate emergency,” they state.

Although there are some positive indicators – such as declining birth rates and a rise in renewable energy use – most indicators suggest humans are rapidly heading in the wrong direction, they say.

Backward steps include rising meat consumption, more air travel, chopping down forests faster than ever and increase in global carbon dioxide emissions. Scientists say they want the public to “understand the magnitude of this crisis, track progress, and realign priorities for alleviating climate change”.

To do so will require major transformations in the ways our global society functions and interacts with natural ecosystems, they say.

The letter focuses on six key objectives: replacing fossil fuels; cutting pollutants like methane and soot; restoring and protecting ecosystems; eating less meat; converting the economy to one that is carbon-free and stabilising population growth.

“Global surface temperature, ocean heat content, extreme weather and its costs, sea level, ocean acidity and land area are all rising,” Professor Ripple said.

“Ice is rapidly disappearing as shown by declining trends in minimum summer Arctic sea ice, Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and glacier thickness. All of these rapid changes highlight the urgent need for action.”

Lead author, Dr Thomas Newsome from the University of Sydney, said measuring global surface temperatures remained important but that a broader set of indicators should be monitored.

This includes “human population growth, meat consumption, tree-cover loss, energy consumption, fossil-fuel subsidies and annual economic losses to extreme weather events”, he said.

“While things are bad, all is not hopeless. We can take steps to address the climate emergency,” he said.

The authors say that despite the gloomy outlook there is room for optimism.

“We are encouraged by a recent surge of concern. Governmental bodies are making climate emergency declarations,” they write.

“Schoolchildren are striking. Ecocide lawsuits are proceeding in the courts. Grassroots citizen movements are demanding change, and many countries, states and provinces, cities, and businesses are responding.

“Such swift action is our best hope to sustain life on planet Earth, our only home.” Reports Independent"

Except there’s a big snag here.

Firstly, the fires currently burning are in suburban and agricultural areas, not forests.

Moreover, the vast majority of forest land in California is owned and managed by the federal government, not the state.

So when Trump is accusing someone of a “terrible job” – he means himself.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: Your federal agencies own the majority of the forest land in CA. Our state only owns about 3%. So when you allege a ""terrible job"" you are actually referring to yourself.

As the New York Times reported this weekend, Trump’s polluting policies are clashing with the sinking reality for millions of Californians that climate change has altered life as they know it.

Fortunately, Trump’s way of thinking isn’t held by everyone. The President may be threatening to cut aid when Americans are dying and losing everything they own, but others are stepping up.

https://bients.com/,https://bients.com/children-were-told-to-build-the-wall-at-white-house-halloween-party/,2019-11-03T21:33:53+01:00,Children were told to ‘build the wall’ at White House Halloween party,"A Halloween party on Oct. 25 at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building featured candy, paper airplanes and — concerning for some attendees — a station where children were encouraged to help “Build the Wall” with their own personalized bricks.

Photos of the children’s mural with the paper wall were provided to Yahoo News.

The party, which took place inside the office building used by White House staff, included the families of executive-branch employees and VIP guests inside and outside government. Even though many of the attendees were members of President Trump’s administration, not everyone thought the Halloween game was a treat.

“Horrified. We were horrified,” said a person who was there and requested anonymity to avoid professional retaliation.

The Eisenhower Executive Office Building stands across from the White House and houses a large portion of the West Wing support staff and is home to the vice president’s ceremonial office.

The party, which took place inside the office building used by White House staff, included the families of executive-branch employees and VIP guests inside and outside government.

“Horrified. We were horrified,” said a person who was there and requested anonymity to avoid professional retaliation.

The lawmakers said they were protesting the lack of transparency from Democrats leading the investigation.

The stunt drew rebukes from Democrats and former intelligence community officials, who argued it impugned the integrity of the process and violated security protocols.

This time, it’s Joe Biden’s brother James, who according to a new report is undergoing legal problems caused by allegations of fraud.

According to Politico, James Biden’s business with medical companies – including Americore Health – has prompted the allegations that he potentially engaged in fraud and traded on his brother’s name, by claiming Joe was interested in the venture and the family name could provide opportunities.

“It was all smoke and mirrors,” former Americore Health executive Tom Pritchard told Politico.

James Biden reportedly convinced Americore that he could use his political clout to deliver a significant influx of cash in the form of an investment from the Middle East, and even convinced the company to take on financial burdens including a six-figure loan to James that he has yet to repay.

James Biden, Americore and Americore founder Grant White are among those now facing a lawsuit from medical companies in Tennessee federal court accusing them of fraud over alleged promises made.

Biden and the other defendants have denied any wrongdoing, but the plaintiffs last month reportedly said in a court filing that they were willing to drop their claims against White, who had provided exculpatory evidence as well as information that further implicated Biden and others.

Americore is also in bankruptcy court after financial woes that, Pritchard said, James Biden only made worse.

In January, the FBI also raided an Americore hospital in Pennsylvania, one of a series of legal complications the company has faced. As noted by Politico, there’s no indication the raid was linked to James Biden’s actions and he has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.

According to the report, James Biden introduced White to his brother. The Biden campaign had confirmed to Politico that White had bought a ticket to a Beau Biden Foundation event in 2017. Any meeting between White and the former vice president “would have been a handshake and nothing more,” they said. The campaign also claimed that Joe Biden never showed support for Americore or even discussed it with his brother.

While President Trump has yet to specifically address this troubling new report, he did tweet about the Biden Family on Monday morning saying, “The Obama/Biden Administration is the most corrupt Administration in the history of our Country!”

Meanwhile Joe Biden has managed to come from behind (with the help of the DNC who hates Bernie Sanders) to now sit comfortably ahead in national polls for the first time ever, posting a new, double-digit lead over Sanders.

“Former Vice President Joe Biden has a double-digit lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, a new CNN poll of Democratic voters nationwide conducted by SSRS shows,” the network reported Monday.

“Biden is now the choice of a majority of Democratic voters nationwide, according to the poll, which was taken in the days after the former vice president’s stronger-than-expected showing across Super Tuesday contests and as the field of Democratic contenders with a realistic shot at winning the nomination narrowed to two.”

Now that roughly a third of all U.S. infections are in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio is under immense pressure and the majority of the city has been shut down with nonessential workers ordered to stay home.

In an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” de Blasio said that he does not expect the situation to improve any time soon and added that “the truth is, it’s only getting worse.”

De Blasio said that the city is struggling to care for its large number of patients and suggested that it was Trump’s fault.

“The president of the United States is from New York City and he will not lift a finger to help his hometown, I don’t get it,” He said. “If the president doesn’t act, people will die who could have lived otherwise,” de Blasio claimed.

When asked specifically what he would like done, de Blasio said that “all military personnel who are medically trained should be sent to places where this crisis is deep – like New York – right now,” claiming they are “the best logistical organization in the nation.”

“Why are they at their bases? Why are they not being allowed to serve? I guarantee you they’re ready to serve, but the president has to give the order.”

New York City residents, however, know where the real blame lies. One group in particular is furious with de Blasio and they’re making it known.

Teachers in Brooklyn are blasting the Mayor for failing to close public schools early enough, which the teachers claim facilitated the spread of coronavirus at one particular school.

At least five teachers from Brooklyn Technical High School teachers have called their union chapter leader, Nate Bonheimer, to tell him they had tested positive for COVID-19.

Even with the information, the Brooklyn Department of Education ordered staffers at BTHS to go to work last week, claiming the building had been cleaned.

“They did not alert the people who needed to know the most to protect themselves, their families and everyone else they came into contact with,” he said.

The outlet reported also that one infected teacher informed all his students that he had tested positive since the city was being so secretive.

“You say equity and excellence, but every other school district closed before you did. You had these kids like petri dishes spreading this to their families,” one administrator told the post.

One DOE employee told the Post that some believe de Blasio and schools chancellor Richard Carranza squashed information about the teachers testing positive for COVID-19, which put more people at risk, saying, “The blood is on their hands.”

“Do I detect Sarcasm there, sir?” the reporter asked.

“No, none whatsoever,” Trump responded.

Pelosi spoke just hours before the Senate was scheduled to take a procedural vote that would lead towards a final vote on a bipartisan economic relief package. The bill would provide economic relief after the coronavirus epidemic ravaged the country’s economy.

“From my standpoint, we’re apart,” she said.

Subsequently, Senate leaders decided to delay a planned vote to 6 p.m. Sunday.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said on the Senate floor on Sunday that he intended for the legislation to be bipartisan and aimed at helping the American people.

“What we have is a compromise product which contains ideas, contributions, and priorities on both sides and which could become law as soon as tomorrow,” he said. “In other words, it’s just about time to take yes for an answer.”

Pelosi and McConnell met with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday to compromise on the third phase of the congressional coronavirus response package.

Pelosi said that Republicans and Democrats are still “talking,” but that there is no need to meet McConnell’s Monday deadline for a Senate vote on the coronavirus package.

Senate Republicans and the White House have insisted that they will continue to push for the $1.6 trillion economic relief package, which would include $350 billion in support for small businesses and $250 billion for unemployment insurance. The package would also include direct cash payments to individuals around $1,200 per individual, with additional funds going to families with children.

Politico reported Sunday that “it’s not clear how Pelosi’s plan would work — committee chairs have been frenetically compiling ideas for a legislative package, but are not yet ready for legislative text.”

Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-SD) said this weekend, “The Democrats are getting some of the things they’ve asked for. They’re getting what they wanted on unemployment insurance.”

“There is an issue here of where we’re coming from,” Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday on CBS’s Face The Nation. “The president has heard, as we all have heard, what I call anecdotal reports that certain drugs work.”

This week, Trump suggested a malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine was one of several that could be used as a treatment.

“I think without seeing too much, I’m probably more of a fan of that,” Trump said. “And we all understand what the doctor said is 100% correct.”

What Trump was trying to express, Fauci said Sunday, “was the hope that if they might work, let’s try and push their usage.”

Fauci said he does not disagree with the fact that “anecdotally, they might work,” but he wants to test and prove what actually works.

“I was taking a purely medical, scientific standpoint, and the president was trying to bring hope to the people,” Fauci said. “I think there’s this issue of trying to separate the two of us. There isn’t fundamentally a difference there. He’s coming to it from a hope, layperson standpoint. I’m coming from it from a scientific standpoint.”

More than 26,000 cases of the virus have been confirmed in the U.S., leading to at least 340 deaths as of Sunday morning.

With ringmaster Whoopi Goldberg participating by remote hookup, thanks to concern about the coronavirus, the co-hosts took on the pandemic on Wednesday, using the top of the show to address the vital question of whether President Donald Trump is stoking racial tensions by using the words “Chinese virus” to discuss the disease that’s upended American daily life.

But it took guest Dan Abrams, ABC’s chief legal analyst, to set the ladies straight: Americans faced with a real crisis, he said, won’t have time or patience for liberal quibbles.

The discussion started with Goldberg, naturally, attacking Trump for his nomenclature.

“You-know-who can’t even figure out what is going on or what to call the pandemic,” she said. “Watch the clip.”

“The View” then played the clip, which showed that Trump knew exactly what to call the pandemic at a news conference: He identified it by its place of origin, or “Chinese virus.”

“China was putting out information, which was false, that our military gave this to them. That was false,” Trump said.

“Rather than having an argument, I said, ‘I have to call it where it came from,’ it did come from China. So I think it’s a very accurate term.”

The discussion that followed was the blend of ignorance of anti-Trump animus that’s been a regular staple on “The View” for the past four years.

Goldberg claimed there was no evidence that China has tried to blame the virus on the United States, when in fact, evidence abounds.

For example, here’s a Twitter post from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao doing exactly that on March 12.

2/2 CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3 — Lijian Zhao 赵立坚 (@zlj517) March 12, 2020

Co-host Sunny Hostin, meanwhile, said the phrasing made her “uncomfortable.”

Maybe it makes her uncomfortable, but truth sometimes has a way of doing that to people who refuse to see it.

It was Abrams’ words that carried the most weight. First, he set the record straight on Chinese accusations that there was an American role in starting the virus. Then he got to the issue of terminology.

“This is one of these issues that I think in particular, if many on the left get too focused on, Trump’s going to win on this,” Abrams said.

“The bottom line is the vast majority of Americans are going to say, ‘Tell me what to do on coronavirus, I care about this virus. It matters. I’m glad finally the Trump administration is recognizing how serious it is.’

“But if people start focusing on what is he calling [it], ‘he’s calling it the Chinese virus versus the coronavirus.’ Look, do I think he should be calling it the Chinese virus? No. But I think it’s a losing argument for the left to make because I think the vast majority of Americans are going to say, ‘Who cares?’”

Quasi-conservative Meghan McCain, as vocal a Trump critic as television has to offer, was OK with the phrasing.

“I agree with you,” she told Abrams. “I think that if the left wants to focus on PC this virus, it is a great way to get Trump re-elected.

“I don’t have a problem with people calling it whatever they want. It’s a deadly virus that did originate in Wuhan. I don’t have a problem with it.

“And I think that China — had they acted right away and we had more access to information, maybe it wouldn’t have gotten to the place that it is.”

And that’s part of what makes this different from the kind of crisis that liberals can spin with their usual word games. As countless closed schools, businesses and churches attest, this is a clear and present danger to the United States, and its point of origin is pretty well understood as not being the United States military.

This isn’t about “drag queen” story hours that disgust sane people, but thrill liberals.

This isn’t about ludicrous “climate change” solutions, fantastic projections of what the world’s temperature will be a century down the road, or any of the other liberal “causes” that have consumed so much American print and airtime during the Trump presidency thanks to the left’s domination of the mainstream media, the nation’s benighted college campuses and the even more benighted glitterati of Hollywood.

This is about a global pandemic, and the very real possibility that it will be a matter of life and death for many, many Americans.

In that context, quibbling about the president’s word choices is the last thing Americans will want to spend time on.

It might not be a “win” for Trump, but it’s going to be a loss for the left.

The liberal ladies on “The View” might not be able to see it, but liberals trying to trip up Trump over trivialities are really just showing the world who they really are.

Sorry, folks, but that ain’t going to happen. Donald Trump is reminding everyone what ol’ Chucky did.

And what’s at stake.

From Twitter:

Cryin’ Chuck Schumer said, “You will pay the price for this. You won’t know what HIT YOU.” That is far beyond simple rhetoric. That is a physical threat, or at least a threat that you better vote for us.” Trouble ahead!

Woah. President Trump quoted the shocking things Schumer said to the Supreme Court, including, “you will pay the price.”

Trump said this was “far beyond” the usual rhetoric we hear from politicians. The president labeled Schumer’s words as a “physical threat.”

Or, put another way, Schumer was pressuring Gorsuch and Kavanaugh to vote his way. A clear attempt, according to Trump, by Schumer to coerce the court.

Trump capped off this tweet with the ominous words, “Trouble ahead.”

The Democrats have tried to paper over Schumer’s words. But this is part of a long history of Democrats inciting violence against conservatives.

Then, we learn about leftists going after lawmakers, conservative speakers, and even everyday Americans.

Now, a U.S. senator is making direct threats to two Supreme Court justices. How can anyone look the other way?

President Trump promises trouble ahead for Schumer. We know that senators are seeking to censure the man. Perhaps other penalties are coming?

Maybe the Senate will fine him. Maybe this will launch an investigation.

Hey, if you or I said that to the SCOTUS, you know the FBI would have already been involved!

Even if you’re a New York Democrat, how can you support a politician when they go after our justices?

The consequences for Schumer just might be severe.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York urged “every single person, no matter your documentation status,” to participate in the 2020 census, which threatens to rob citizens of their true representation in Congress.

Appearing on “Late Night with host Seth Meyers” on Thursday, the self-described democratic socialist said, “We’re all going to get census forms — we’re gonna get mailed a prompt to fill out the census in the next two weeks or so.

“And so I think what’s really important is that we all fill this out. It happens once every 10 years. Every single person, no matter your documentation status, no matter your housing status, income, etc., is to be counted.”

She went on to explain the census numbers are used to determine school funding, infrastructure spending, and “of course how many members of Congress each community gets.”

The freshman lawmaker warned that in some parts of New York that self-reporting for the census is about half of what officials would anticipate.

AOC reassured the census concerned that the information collected is “completely confidential.”

“Your census data is not shared with any other federal agency at all,” she said. “So don’t worry if you’re having a creative living situation, it’s not going to be told to your landlord or anything crazy like that. No worry. Totally safe.”

A report released in December by the fiscally conservative Empire Center in New York projected the state could lose up to two of its 27 congressional seats following the 2020 census.

One of the House seats that looks to be in jeopardy is the 14th District represented by Ocasio-Cortez.

The district, which includes parts of the Bronx and Queens, is made up of 47 percent foreign-born residents, according to The City.

The loss would happen after this November’s election.

It’s also worth noting the Electoral College total for each state, which is used to elect the president, is calculated by adding the number congressional seats plus the two U.S. Senate positions.

Making the counting of foreign-born all the more important for New York has been the net outflow from the Empire State to other parts of the country over the last decade.

“New York’s cumulative net domestic migration loss of 1,379,210 residents to other states since 2010 was the largest of any state in absolute terms, and second only to Alaska as a percentage of estimated population at the start of the decade,” the Empire Center said in the report.

According to the Center for Immigration Studies, the inclusion of illegal immigrants would mean New York would not lose seats but rather gain one.

“Illegal immigrants alone in … 2020 will redistribute three seats, with Ohio, Alabama, and Minnesota each having one fewer seat than they otherwise would have had, while California, New York, and Texas will have one additional seat,” CIS said.

CIS Director of Research Steven Camarota and demographer Karen Ziegler went on to argue in their report the inclusion of illegals for congressional apportionment violates the Supreme Court-established principle of “one man, one vote.”

In other words, one person’s voting power in one state ought to be more or less equal to that in another state.

However, if districts like AOC’s remain intact as those in other states disappear due to illegal immigrant populations, that is not fair to U.S. citizens whose votes have less of an impact.

“While one can at least argue that legal permanent residents who have not naturalized are entitled to representation in Congress because they are future Americans, illegal aliens and temporary visitors can make no such claim,” Camarota and Ziegler contended.

In a dumbfounding move, the Supreme Court ruled in July that the Trump administration had provided an adequate rationale for including the citizenship question in the 2020 census, so it was pulled.

“Seems totally ridiculous that our government, and indeed Country, cannot ask a basic question of Citizenship in a very expensive, detailed and important Census, in this case for 2020,” President Donald Trump said on Twitter after the ruling, adding, “Can anyone really believe that as a great Country, we are not able the ask whether or not someone is a Citizen.”

Now, it all comes down to how many illegal immigrants decide to cooperate in the census.

AOC is hoping their participation will be robust.

https://www.nationalinsiders.com/the-most-corrupt-political-family-in-american-history/,https://www.nationalinsiders.com/breaking-vp-joe-biden-under-criminal-investigation/,2020-02-28T16:39:14,Breaking: VP Joe Biden Under Criminal Investigation,"Ukraine has launched a criminal investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden which alleges that he pressured authorities, forcing the resignation of Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.

Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, received more than $3 million from the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings while his father oversaw a U.S. effort to address corruption in Ukraine.

This was a subject of the July 25 phone call at the center of the articles of impeachment against President Trump.

All along, we all knew the ones who actually committed a crime here were the Bidens, and now its time for them to be brought to justice.

The Interfax-Ukraine news agency, quoting Shokin’s lawyer, reported the country’s State Bureau of Investigations opened the case under an appeal by Shokin.

Shokin’s lawyer, Oleksandr Teleshetsky, said at a press conference Feb. 27 that the charge is interfering in the work of an official of a law enforcement agency.

Shokin included Biden’s name in his motion, which prompted the opening of the case, Interfax said. The lawyer also said the SBI is also handling criminal cases opened in response to Shokin’s motion on charges of disclosing pretrial probe secrets to employees of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine.

He explained that Biden is their suspect in three different criminal offenses, which have been merged into one case.

Teleshetsky said he’s asking the Prosecutor General’s Office to seek the assistance of the U.S. in the investigation.

“We’ll definitely do this. This is one of the priorities in this criminal investigation, because this case can’t be investigated without involving mechanisms of international legal cooperation,” he said.

“Judging by remarks Biden allowed himself to make in public, Viktor Mykolayovych Shokin has sufficient grounds to believe that it was [Biden] who masterminded and, to a certain extent, perpetrated those criminal offenses to which Shokin alerted the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine,” the lawyer said.

Teleshetsky noted that Greek law enforcement agencies are investigating Shokin’s mercury poisoning in 2019. He said Shokin links the incident to Biden.

“The results of this investigation are not yet available today. We don’t have sufficient grounds to … file motions and requests with the law enforcement agencies of Greece before they establish the objective truth in all circumstances,” he said. “Possibly, they will appear tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.”

This is a scandal of epic proportions that the Democrats have done their best to cover up, and it has finally reached a boiling point.

Peter Schweizer, who exposed the Hunter Biden-Ukraine deal in his 2018 book “Secret Empires,” said in an interview with SiriusXMs Breitbart News Daily that the key to understanding the matter is the timing.

“The timing is clear: February of 2014, Putin moves into Crimea, that creates this whole crisis,” he said. “In March of 2014, Joe is point person on Ukraine policy. Within three weeks, Ukrainians suddenly decide, ‘Hey Hunter Biden is the guy, the expert, we want to join this company. And yeah, we need to pay him a million dollars a year.’

“You look at that and think, ‘This is absurd.’ … It’s not like he was advising Ukraine in 2005,” said Schweizer.

His new book, “Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite,” presents evidence that five members of Biden’s family profited from his position as vice president of the United States.

Schweizer also recalled that when the Obama administration “pivoted” its foreign policy to Asia, Hunter Biden accompanied his father on a trip to Beijing on Air Force Two.

“Joe goes over there on one of his first significant trips, and what does he do? His son comes with him, and 10 days after the trip, the son suddenly announces this billon-and-a-half-dollar private equity deal,” Schweizer said.

“It’s clear, it’s crystal clear what’s going on.”

Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich wants you to know he’s not feeling “suicidal.”

He wanted to make that clear as he begins outing former failed President Barack Obama for his role in the “sale” of his Illinois Senate seat.

His words are haunting, especially after we just learned that a former DHS whistleblower under the Obama administration “committed suicide” Saturday night.

The interview began with host Jesse Watters asking whether Obama had been involved in his post-2008 election plans to sell the then-president’s former Senate seat.

“Did you ever talk to Barack Obama about this Senate seat. Did he have any knowledge about what was going on or not?” the host asked.

“President Obama began the whole conversation because he sent someone to me as a middleman, a mediator — not unusual in politics — on the night he was elected president to say that he’d like to talk about his choice for the Senate and to see what I might be willing to ask for,” Blagojevich replied.

“[It was] political horse-trading, not what those corrupt prosecutors said it was.” [Bizpacreview]

He added that the mediator was Tom Balanoff, “a big union leader” who the records show spoke at the 2008 Democrat National Convention on behalf of Obama.

It’s crazy for anyone to think Obama wasn’t involved in this someway. It was his Senate seat, for crying out loud.

Or will this be yet another situation where the elite Deep State liberals get away with “murder”?

(Infowars) – The lawyer of retired General Mike Flynn claims that Anthony Weiner’s laptop seized by the NYPD in 2016 contained hundreds of thousands of Hillary Clinton emails revealing heinous crimes.

In a speech delivered at Hillsdale College last week, Sidney Powell claimed that the laptop belonging to Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s ex-husband Anthony Weiner contains “675,000 emails” detailing crimes related to the Clinton Foundation, and possibly much worse offenses which deeply disturbed investigators who reviewed them.

“It was all the Clinton emails, the Clinton Foundation, her Secretary of State emails, Huma Abedin’s emails – lots of people emailing Huma as a proxy for Hillary,” Powell told the audience.

Powell recommended that President Trump ensure Weiner’s laptop gets into trusted hands within the military to examine all the emails.

“So one of the things, if I were the president I’d do, is demand the Anthony Weiner laptop and get it to the most trusted person in the military to take apart everything on it, and then start using it.”

“There’s a LOT that can be prosecuted, I have no doubt, on that laptop,” Powell continued, adding that some crimes may be downright atrocious.

“In fact, I heard that the New York Police officer who saw some of it, even though they’re hardened investigators, literally had to go throw up. It’s bad,” she added.

In 2016 just before the presidential election, prosecutor Doug Hagmann reported that the FBI found evidence of treason, money laundering and connections to child exploitation – including the infamous “Lolita Express” jet belonging to billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein – on Weiner’s laptop.

“It involves Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, and Bill Clinton as well as Jeffrey Epstein,” Hagmann said on The Alex Jones Show. “According to my source, these files exist – he did not touch these files so he doesn’t know what’s in them, but the fact that they exist on this computer suggest some sort of overlap here.”

“It involves the Saudis, very big money and interests in the Middle East, and it involves Hillary, Huma, and to a much lesser extent Anthony Weiner,” he added.

During her weekly press conference last Thursday, she said, “Lives are at stake. This is not a time for name-calling or playing politics.”

Shortly after it had ended she was criticizing President Trump over his administration’s response to the coronavirus crisis as anemic, opaque, too late and often chaotic.

All the while, Pelosi was holding back a House bill to provide funding to fight it.

Speaking with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham on Monday night, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said, “Look how much politics they want to play. The dirty little secret. We have the coronavirus. We need to fund this. You know what Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker, did? She withheld the bill last week. You know why? So the DCCC could run ads against seven Republicans.”

Ingraham asked, “How many people ran ads on the coronavirus, fundraising appeals?”

“I don’t know how many ran, but they actually took the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, spent money, went into these seven Republican seats to campaign against them about the coronavirus when she’s the Speaker of the House. Instead of putting America first, she put her politics first and kept the bill from coming to the floor,” McCarthy explained.

What a scam—Speaker Pelosi held up the vote on coronavirus funding so that her campaign team could run ads against Republicans for Super Tuesday. Instead of putting America first, she is putting politics first. pic.twitter.com/ws0nn0hUXP — Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) March 3, 2020

This is not surprising. For the Democrats, the coronavirus outbreak has become their latest weapon with which to damage the President.

McCarthy brought this up during a GOP press conference today. He told reporters:

Last week, we had an opportunity to bring forth the Supplemental, the needed funds for public health and others to deal with this item. We are not the majority. We cannot determine the floor, so Speaker Pelosi left, and had us leave Congress. This week, we hope we’re going to be able to bring it up.

The one concerning issue that I have, not as just the leader of the Republicans, but really as an American. Why didn’t we vote on it last week? And why now is the Democratic arm of the DCCC running ads against seven Republicans? On something they could not vote on, because they could not control it. Are they playing politics and holding the money up so their political arm can attack Republicans on this issue? Can they, for one time put people before politics? I think they owe the American people an apology. I think the Speaker needs to apologize. Cheri Bustos needs to take those ads down and stop playing politics with this.

America is nervous. We’ve been preparing for years in advance. We’ve got to make sure we have all the needed resources there.

So bring the bill to the floor.

Earlier in the conference, the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep.Greg Walden (R-OR), spoke and said that Democrats were trying to include HR3 (Elijah Cummings’ Lower Drug Costs Now Act) with the bill for coronavirus funding. HR3 is a very controversial bill which will require some debate. Walden basically said, let’s keep this separate, because the funds to fight the coronavirus crisis are needed now.

It was a valiant effort Republicans, but unfortunately, I doubt too many of the journalists in the room will be reporting on it.

President Donald Trump shot down a reporter’s question during a coronavirus media briefing on Thursday over previous accusations of racism made by her network.

NBC’s Kristen Welker asked a pointed question about the government’s preparedness in relation to the pandemic, and the president fired back.

“You did say a few days ago, though, you did have a sense that this was a pandemic that was coming, so why was the United States not prepared with more testing?” asked Welker.

“We were very prepared. The only thing we weren’t prepared for was the media. The media has not treated it fairly,” responded the president.

“I’ll tell you how prepared I was. I called for a ban from people coming in from China, long before anybody thought it was, in fact, it was your network, I believe they called me a racist because I did that,” he added.

“It was, many of the people in the room, they called me racist and other words because I did that, because I went so early,” Trump continued. “So when you say we weren’t prepared, had I let these tens of thousands of people come in from China a day, we woulda had something right now that woulda been, you wouldn’t have even recognized it, compared to where we are.”

Other critics of the president have pointed to shortages of medical supplies to combat coronavirus, including ventilators and masks, in addition to test kits.

This time, it’s Joe Biden’s brother James, who according to a new report is undergoing legal problems caused by allegations of fraud.

According to Politico, James Biden’s business with medical companies – including Americore Health – has prompted the allegations that he potentially engaged in fraud and traded on his brother’s name, by claiming Joe was interested in the venture and the family name could provide opportunities.

“It was all smoke and mirrors,” former Americore Health executive Tom Pritchard told Politico.

James Biden reportedly convinced Americore that he could use his political clout to deliver a significant influx of cash in the form of an investment from the Middle East, and even convinced the company to take on financial burdens including a six-figure loan to James that he has yet to repay.

James Biden, Americore and Americore founder Grant White are among those now facing a lawsuit from medical companies in Tennessee federal court accusing them of fraud over alleged promises made.

Biden and the other defendants have denied any wrongdoing, but the plaintiffs last month reportedly said in a court filing that they were willing to drop their claims against White, who had provided exculpatory evidence as well as information that further implicated Biden and others.

Americore is also in bankruptcy court after financial woes that, Pritchard said, James Biden only made worse.

In January, the FBI also raided an Americore hospital in Pennsylvania, one of a series of legal complications the company has faced. As noted by Politico, there’s no indication the raid was linked to James Biden’s actions and he has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.

According to the report, James Biden introduced White to his brother. The Biden campaign had confirmed to Politico that White had bought a ticket to a Beau Biden Foundation event in 2017. Any meeting between White and the former vice president “would have been a handshake and nothing more,” they said. The campaign also claimed that Joe Biden never showed support for Americore or even discussed it with his brother.

While President Trump has yet to specifically address this troubling new report, he did tweet about the Biden Family on Monday morning saying, “The Obama/Biden Administration is the most corrupt Administration in the history of our Country!”

Meanwhile Joe Biden has managed to come from behind (with the help of the DNC who hates Bernie Sanders) to now sit comfortably ahead in national polls for the first time ever, posting a new, double-digit lead over Sanders.

“Former Vice President Joe Biden has a double-digit lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, a new CNN poll of Democratic voters nationwide conducted by SSRS shows,” the network reported Monday.

“Biden is now the choice of a majority of Democratic voters nationwide, according to the poll, which was taken in the days after the former vice president’s stronger-than-expected showing across Super Tuesday contests and as the field of Democratic contenders with a realistic shot at winning the nomination narrowed to two.”

A Washington Post fact-checker ruled Thursday that Joe Biden hadn’t lied when he said he supported a fracking ban during Sunday’s Democratic presidential debate. Rather, Biden had simply “described his fracking stance inaccurately.”

The Post gave Biden “Zero Pinocchios” for saying during the most recent Democratic debate that he opposed fracking entirely. Instead, the paper pointed to the Biden campaign’s explanation that the candidate had “misspoken” and that “his position was the same as ever,” opposing fracking only on public lands.

Meanwhile, the Post criticized those who quoted Biden’s remarks verbatim. “Critics pounced,” the fact-checker wrote. “Republican operatives cut a short video of Biden’s remarks, to use as a cudgel in races against moderate House Democrats. Sanders supporters accused Biden of misleading voters about his policy, which doesn’t ban fracking outright, as Sanders would.”

During Sunday’s debate, Sanders said that he was pushing for a ban on future fracking. “So am I,” Biden responded.

“Well, I’m not sure your proposal does that,” Sanders replied. Later, the Vermont senator said, “You cannot continue, as I understand, Joe believes, to continue fracking.”

“No more—no new fracking,” Biden said in response.

“The Trump campaign also used a Biden video snippet from the debate in a tweet claiming he would ‘ban fracking,'” the Post complained. “Right-wing media outlets including the Washington Free Beacon, the Daily Caller and Fox News all reported on Biden’s remarks as though he had adopted a tougher line.”

The Free Beacon article quoting Biden’s remarks, to which the Post did not link, covered Biden’s statement during the debate that there’d be “no more drilling” under his administration and only mentioned the fracking comments as an aside. The Free Beacon accurately wrote that “Biden, confronted by Sanders for not taking dramatic enough steps to combat climate change, also said there would be no ‘new fracking’ and ‘not another coal plant will be built’ under his administration.”

Biden’s drilling comments, another instance of the candidate “misspeaking” in a way that made his environmental platform more palatable to his party’s left-wing base, was not acknowledged in the Post fact-check.

Biden previously said he “misspoke,” avoiding a bad rating from the Post fact-checker, after he was caught falsely claiming on two separate occasions that he opposed the Iraq war from the moment it started.

“Regular readers know that we withhold Pinocchios when a politician admits error. Biden was on his way to Four Pinocchios until his staff acknowledged that he misspoke,” the Post wrote. “So we will leave this unrated and let readers make their own decision.”

After the stock market crashed to its worst fall since 1987 on Thursday, the Federal Reserve announced it would inject $1.5 trillion in capital into the stock market in an effort to offset coronavirus-related economic disruptions.

FYI, the amount that the Fed just injected almost covers all student loan debt in the US. There is absolutely NO excuse for not pausing student debt collections, planning for mortgage &rent relief, etc. We need to care for working people as much as we care for the stock market. https://t.co/IT6qZA2gtt — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 12, 2020

Fortunately, they have been called out by free market energy policy analysts and advocates who are opposed to Green New Deal-type policies that could greatly inflate the cost of the stimulus package under consideration.

The House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, along with Democratic Sens. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, is making every effort to “slip extensions for expired tax giveaways and Green New Deal policies into the current funding package meant to stabilize the economy and aid Americans suffering from the coronavirus,” according to a press release from the American Energy Alliance, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that favors free market energy policies.

AEA points to several reports and documents, including this one, that describe how House and Senate Democrats operating in partnership with green advocacy groups and renewable energy interests have seized upon an old playbook. In the past few days, it has become evident that they are working to exploit the crisis in an effort to enact policies that expand the size and influence of government while raising energy costs.

Some of the green giveaways currently on deck in Congress include extending the consumer tax credit for electric vehicles while also expanding on tax credits for wind and solar power favored by environmental activists. Markey, who is a primary sponsor of the Green New Deal resolution in the Senate, is also working with Whitehouse to combine aid for airlines with green energy restrictions.

Tom Pyle, the president of AEA, had some choice words for political figures who seek to “slip failed green policies” into legislation that should remain focused on the coronavirus.

“The proposed inclusion of seven expired renewable energy tax credits will do nothing to stimulate the economy or help anyone’s general health, and will only line the pockets of renewable energy companies, the wind and solar lobby, General Motors and Tesla,” he said in the press release. “For industries that claim they no longer need the support of the government, we continue to see them try and capitalize on the suffering of everyday Americans in the pursuit of a seemingly never-ending stream of government handouts.”

Pyle continued, “From the presidential primary, to the response to this unprecedented global pandemic, it appears the green lobby is a growing and disturbing force within the Democratic Party, driving them to an extreme, radical, out-of-touch agenda that is now literally bargaining with people’s lives.”

Adam Schiff (D-CA) and the Intelligence Committee he chairs asked the US District Court for the District of Columbia to toss out a lawsuit against them for obtaining phone records of high-profile conservatives which resulted in the ‘doxing’ of their non-public private information.

The impeachment-related subpoenas resulted in the publication of the private phone numbers for Rudy Giuliani, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), journliast John Solomon, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow, attorney Victoria Toensing and others, according to Judicial Watch.

In their 14-page motion Schiff and the Committee claim “sovereign immunity;” “Speech or Debate Clause” privilege; immunity from FOIA and transparency law; that the records are secret; and that Judicial Watch and public do not need to see them.

Judicial Watch filed its lawsuit under the public’s common-law right of public access to examine government records after it received no response to a December 6, 2019, records request (Judicial Watch v. v Adam Schiff and U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (No. 1:19-03790)):

All subpoenas issued by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on or about September 30, 2019 to any telecommunications provider including, but not limited to AT&T, Inc., for all records of telephone calls of any individuals

All responses received to the above subpoenas. –Judicial Watch

Schiff is being sued in his capacity as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. According to the lawsuit:

The records are of critical public importance as the subpoenas were issued without any lawful basis and violated the rights of numerous private citizens.

Disclosure of the requested records would serve the public interest by providing information about the unlawful issuance of the subpoenas.

The requested records fall within the scope of the public’s right of access to governmental records as a matter of federal common law.

“Schiff’s new court filing to try to avoid disclosing his abusive subpoenas of confidential phone records suggests he and Congress can secretly subpoena and publish the phone records of any American with zero accountability under law to the people,” said Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, adding “Speaker Pelosi and every House member should be asked if they agree that they are above the law and can spy on any American.”

The draft legislation, obtained by Fox News, would provide minimum payments of $600, and aid would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child.

The rebate amount is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer’s income exceeds the legislation’s threshold. The amount is therefore reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers.

The IRS would determine income based on taxpayers’ 2018 tax returns, or 2019 tax returns in cases where there is no 2018 return — a provision that The Federalist’s Sean Davis called “idiotic,” given that many “jobs or businesses disappeared within the last month.”

Qualifying income includes earned income, as well as Social Security retirement benefits and certain compensation and pension benefits paid to veterans. This approach “ensures relief gets to low-income seniors and disabled veterans” as well, top Republicans said in their summary of the legislation.

And, similar to previous disaster-related relief provisions, the bill would “waive the 10-percent early withdrawal penalty for distributions up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts for coronavirus-related purposes.”

McConnell’s proposal aligns with the Trump administration’s push to swiftly send checks to U.S. citizens.

The legislation additionally contains numerous provisions geared at helping small businesses, including a delay of payment for employer payroll taxes, a delay of estimated tax payments for corporations, and modifications for net operating losses.

McConnell’s plan would provide $208 billion in loans and loan guarantees to distressed sectors of the economy, including $50 billion for commercial airlines and $8 billion for air cargo carriers, and $150 billion for other eligible businesses, but those loans would have to be paid back.

It’s an opening salvo in fast-track talks with Democrats as President Trump urges Congress to “go big” to respond as Americans reel from the crisis.

McConnell, R-Ky., speaking on the Senate floor, said he wanted key Republicans to meet with Democrats on the relief bill, known as S.3548, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (Phase III).

“These are urgent discussions and they need to happen at the member level,” McConnell said, noting the White House will send key personnel to talk about the bill as they try to forge a compromise.

I have not been able to fully review Senator McConnell's proposal yet but as far as I can tell it has a glaring multi hundred billion dollar omission: no support for states. In fact delaying tax filing would delay revenue for the many states that piggy back on federal filing. — Jason Furman (@jasonfurman) March 19, 2020

Fox News is told McConnell did not yet have the votes on his side, and that the situation was complicated by the fact that two Republicans have self-quarantined. The GOP holds a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, with Vice President Mike Pence the possible tiebreaking vote.

Speaking after McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., complained that Republicans had sought “no input” from Democrats, and asserted that no Democrats had even seen the bill.

He added he was told “there is a bailout for industries” in the measure.

“The number one priority is addressing this health crisis, which requires a Marshall Plan to rebuild our health care infrastructure on a continental scale and ensure the resources are there to test and treat everyone who needs it,” Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a joint statement.

“To earn Democratic support in the Congress, any economic stimulus proposal must include new, strong and strict provisions that prioritize and protect workers, such as banning the recipient companies from buying back stock, rewarding executives, and laying off workers,” they added. “We look forward to working in a bipartisan way to deliver for the American people as soon as humanly possible.”

Even some of McConnell’s GOP senators have said they preferred instead to use the federal dollars to keep workers who are asked to stay home on the business payrolls.

“What I want is income, not one check,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., summing up the views of some exiting a long, private meeting of GOP senators on Capitol Hill. One or two checks “makes no sense to me,” he said.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday morning told Fox Business Network that the White House was looking at payments of $1,000 to most adult Americans within three weeks, as a way to stem the widespread economic damage caused by shuttered businesses and social distancing.

Mnuchin also said that if the crisis were still ongoing in six weeks, the federal government would deliver another round of checks worth the same amount of money.

The Treasury secretary said Thursday the checks would be direct-deposited into people’s accounts.

Though unusual, stimulus checks are not unprecedented. Former President George W. Bush’s administration twice successfully pushed for economic stimulus checks.

Meanwhile, President Trump on Wednesday signed the second coronavirus relief bill into law that provides paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans.

The legislation provides 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states.

The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered.

This is because, as he notes on his Twitter profile, he’s an “Apostate GOP Media Guy.” If you’re wondering what that means, it’s pretty much the same grift that people like Ana Navarro and Max Boot have mastered: If you’re a former Republican that’s done something slightly notable and you’ve had a change of heart prompted by Trump, you get all sorts of air time.

Say what you will about Navarro and Boot, they were relatively accomplished before they decided to become apostate GOP media people. Rick Wilson was kinda sorta known. I mean, I’d seen him once or twice, somewhere, I think. However, self-promotion and self-reported apostasy have paid off well for Wilson, who’s now a not-infrequent guest on CNN and MSNBC. He’s also the co-head of the Lincoln Project, a putatively conservative effort to unseat President Trump.

Readers might remember him from a widely criticized appearance in January with CNN’s Don Lemon, where Wilson mocked the intelligence of President Donald Trump’s supporters while Lemon and another guest laughed uproariously.

The frequency of his appearances could reduce in the very near future, however, considering he tweeted that Melania Trump should be infected with coronavirus.

On Wednesday, the White House announced that the first lady would be appearing in a series of public service announcements designed to educate Americans about the ways they can avoid COVID-19 infection.

In a news release, the White House said she would emphasize “important ways Americans can protect themselves and those most at risk,” according to CNN.

And thus did Rick Wilson remind you again that he existed, only in the worst possible way.

See, he’s making a pun on the first lady’s anti-bullying Be Best campaign, only he’s hoping she’s infected with a dread illness we’re all inside trying to avoid. Funny, right?

This got the kind of reactions you might expect.

This is the most insidious & hateful rhetoric of anyone who exists in political punditry. Rick Wilson is wishing Coronavirus on Melania Trump. It doesn’t matter if the wish is aimed at a First Lady, or a doctor, a teacher, a policewoman. It is despicable. He deserves no platform. https://t.co/uTr5RVZSTX — Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) March 19, 2020

Author Rick Wilson Wishes Coronavirus Infection on First Lady Melania Trump… IF YOU COULD SAY ONE THING TO RICK, WHAT WOULD IT BE? https://t.co/MoP224M2d1 — Chuck Callesto (@ChuckCallesto) March 19, 2020

This was, however, a hill that Wilson was apparently willing to die on. Replying to Washington Examiner columnist Tim Carney, the apostate was unrepentant.

Insofar as #BeBest has been a travesty from the jump, you mean? Insofar as her online bullying efforts are placed in absurd contrast by her husband's daily actions? That's how I meant it. https://t.co/HMf3OQVoeY — Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) March 19, 2020

“Insofar as #BeBest has been a travesty from the jump, you mean?” he wrote. “Insofar as her online bullying efforts are placed in absurd contrast by her husband’s daily actions?

“That’s how I meant it,” he said

So, if a first lady has an anti-bullying campaign and you think the president is a bully, Wilson either thinks it’s funny to joke about her being infected with coronavirus or he actually believes she should be infected.

He made another vulgar attempt to explain himself. WARNING: The obscenity is not blacked out in the original tweet.)

None of your fake outrage will matter in a day or two. None. — Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) March 19, 2020

The outrage over his comments, no. The outrage he displayed with the #BeInfected tweet, yes.

It’s difficult to imagine networks aren’t going to back away from Wilson, who apparently decided during a pandemic that it was all right to joke that Melania Trump should be a victim of the coronavirus because of her Be Best campaign, or something. Nobody is going to think that’s remotely proportional or the work of a man who’s looking at this situation in a clear-eyed and somber manner.

Say what you will about Ana Navarro and her nail-filing antics, at least I don’t think she’d wish a deadly infection upon anyone.

The same now can’t be said for Wilson, which — one hopes — is enough to curtail his airtime.

You may remember that Lincoln Project that Wilson is involved in that I mentioned at the outset. In December, Wilson, along with a few other ex-Republican NeverTrumpers — the curiously married George Conway, along with Steve Schmidt and John Weaver — co-authored a commentary piece for The New York Times announcing the inception of the organization.

The Lincoln Project, they wrote, is “an effort to highlight our country’s story and values, and its people’s sacrifices and obligations. This effort transcends partisanship and is dedicated to nothing less than preservation of the principles that so many have fought for, on battlefields far from home and within their own communities.”

Do those principles and values involve jokes about someone getting coronavirus as the entire country gets put on pause to avoid a second coming of the 1918 influenza outbreak? I mean, I understand they’re two different arenas, but a lot of Wilson’s talk is about “principles.” That’s why, he implies, principled individuals can’t support the current president.

If only he had enough principles not to call for the first lady to be infected in the middle of a pandemic lockdown.

Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) presidential campaign reportedly “signaled” Wednesday night that they may be open to ending their bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination and admitted that they are “speaking” to former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign staff.

The Washington Post reports that Sanders, whose top advisors said Wednesday morning that they were “reassessing” the senator’s chances at snagging the nomination in the interim between now and the next set of primaries three weeks from now, may be looking for a way to bow out of the contest that will preserve his impact on the race so far and his followers’ impact on the Democratic party platform.

“The next primary contest is at least three weeks away,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir told media in a statement Wednesday. “Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.”

In a separate message to Sanders’ supporters, campaign aides said that Sanders was returning to Washington, D.C., to help handle the coronavirus situation, but that he and his wife, Jane, would be speaking with supporters to determine whether carrying on a doomed presidential run would be somehow beneficial.

Wednesday afternoon, the Sanders campaign suspended social media advertising, a development that was initially reported as a full campaign “suspension” — a story that was almost immediately corrected.

Perhaps the Sanders campaign’s most significant move — and the best evidence that they are considering a swift and untimely end to the Vermont socialist’s bid — was reaching out to Biden’s campaign, which they reportedly did sometime on Wednesday morning.

“Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said that aides to the two candidates have been in touch regularly to discuss the public health crisis that has gripped the country,” the Washington Post reported, “disclosing talks that could form the basis of a broader agreement on policies and might make Sanders more comfortable leaving the race.”

Not every presidential campaign, of course, simply wraps up. Sanders may want to ink a deal with Biden and the Democratic National Convention that gives Sanders a place of prominence in the Democratic party, some control over the Democratic party platform (which will be rewritten and voted on at the convention in July) and some measure of visibility.

Back in 2016, Sanders and then-likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton inked their own deal — a deal which reportedly included an agreement to keep Sanders’ supporters from protesting at the 2016 DNC.

“The recently released book “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign” by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes reveals that Sanders Campaign Manager Jeff Weaver struck a deal with the Clinton campaign to keep Sanders delegates away from television cameras in order to hide the divisions in the party from audiences across the country,” the Observer reported in 2017.

Clinton also famously agreed to pay for Sanders’ private jet, so that he could attend rallies in support of Clinton’s 2016 effort.

This time around, Biden may want to make the same trade: Sanders and the Democratic socialists can have some influence over what the party stands for, if they agree not to hold massive, public protests outside the Democratic National Convention, undermining Biden’s chances at defeating President Donald Trump.

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) argued that 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden would “bring back decency and dignity to the White House.”

Klobuchar said, “In terms of what they should know about Joe Biden, I think it’s what we saw last night. A true leader, someone who has worked for change his whole life, someone who will have the back of the American people. What is so missing in this White House as you just discussed earlier in the show with the way he’s been handling the discussion on this virus, what’s so missing, the decency, the dignity that Joe Biden will bring back to the White House. he’s someone of great empathy, and I know you know this, Meghan, because Joe Biden was a good friend of your dad’s.”

She added, “He’s someone that will go that extra mile. I remember a friend of mine whose husband died, and Joe Biden had come to Minnesota and done an event. When I called to thank him—this is years and years ago —I told him that my friend’s husband, who had helped with the event, had suddenly died. It was of a virus actually leaving three teenage girls. I said, ‘maybe you can drop her a note or something, it might be nice, widowed at such a young age.’ He didn’t do that. He said, ‘I want her cell phone.’ I said, ‘no, you don’t have to do that, Mr. vice president.’”

“He said, ‘yes,’” she continued. “He called my friend while she was driving home from work her first day. He made her pull over on the road, the vice president of the United States, and made her write down his cell phone on her hand so she could call him whenever it was hard because he had lost his own family members. That’s just a story no one knew that story until I just told it on the show. That’s the kind of empathy that he has for people. I think that came out very clearly last night.”

Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R) announced the diagnosis on Twitter, writing: “I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better. However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus. We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times.”

A statement from his office said, “In an abundance of caution, after votes on Friday, March 13th, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart decided to self-quarantine in Washington, D.C, and not return to South Florida because of his wife Tia’s pre-existing conditions that put her at exceptionally high risk. On Saturday evening, Congressman Diaz-Balart developed symptoms, including a fever and a headache. Just a short while ago, he was notified that he has tested positive for COVID-19. While in quarantine Diaz-Balart has been working from his apartment in Washington, DC.”

The news comes as hundreds of thousands of people worldwide have been infected with the virus which has now killed over 8,500 people.

Diaz-Balart is not the only member of Congress to have self-quarantined over exposure to the virus as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Rep. Julia Brownley (D-CA), Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA), Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Rep. John Yarmuth (D-KY), Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Rep. Gwen Moore (D-WI), Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO), Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), and Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA) have all self-quarantined.

The news also comes as Democrat Senator Michael Bennett (CO) reportedly declined on Tuesday to self-quarantine after possible exposure to the virus.

The Trump administration is urging Americans to follow a guidance plan over the next 15 days to prevent the spread of the virus. The guidance plan states:

Listen and follow the directions of your state and local authorities.

If you feel sick, stay home. Do not go to work. Contact your medical provider.

If your children are sick, keep them at home. Do not send them to school. Contact your medical provider.

If someone in your household has tested positive for the coronavirus, keep the entire household at home. Do not go to work. Do not go to school. Contact your medical provider.

If you are an older person, stay home and away from other people.

If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition that can put you at increased risk (for example, a condition that impairs your lung or heart function or weakens your immune system), stay home and away from other people.

Even if you are young, or otherwise healthy, you are at risk and your activities can increase the risk for others. It is critical that you do your part to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

Work or engage in schooling from home whenever possible.

If you work in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the Department of Homeland Security, such as health care service and pharmaceutical and food supply, you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule. You and your employers should follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance to protect your health at work.

Avoid social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people.

Avoid eating or drinking in bars, restaurants, and food courts — use drive-thru, pick-up or delivery options.

Avoid discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits.

Do not visit nursing homes or retirement or long-term care facilities unless to provide critical assistance.

Practice good hygiene.

Practice good hygiene. Wash your hands, especially after touching any frequently used item or surface.

(Infowars) – 62 per cent of Americans believe that the media has exaggerated the threat of coronavirus, according to a new Pew Research poll.

The results of the survey found that 63 per cent of Americans believe the CDC and public health officials have got the risk of COID-19 about right, with just 21 per cent believing they have exaggerated the risks.

While 62 per cent think the media has overhyped the threat, 29 per cent believe President Trump hasn’t taken it seriously at all while a further 52 per cent say he has not taken the risk seriously enough.

Only 30 per cent say the media has handled the issue appropriately, while just 8 per cent say the press has not taken the risks seriously enough.

On a partisan breakdown, 76 per cent of Republicans think the media has exaggerated the threat compared to 49 per cent of Democrats.

There is still a significant number of people who believe that the response to coronavirus has been over the top or even hysterical, with many suggesting that once a large number of people in the U.S. are tested, the mortality rate of COVID-19 will drop substantially.

Others point to infection and death toll numbers out of Italy to make the point that overreacting is essential to stopping the spread of the virus and preventing deaths in the hundreds of thousands.

Fresh off the Northam news, Attorney General Mark Herring, second in line to assume the governorship of the Commonwealth, today admitted to dressing in blackface when he was a 19-year-old college student at the University of Virginia in 1980. Herring, who was among those calling on Northam to resign, said he was “deeply, deeply sorry for the paint that I cause with this revelation.”

Virginia’s Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax, widely considered for the position of Governor in the event Northam resigns, has found himself in the midst of sexual assault allegations. No word on whether or not Democrats in the state will support his candidacy following the allegations.

National Report reached out to the head of the Virginia Legislative Blackface Caucus, but no response was provided prior to publication.

Donald J. Trump, fresh from a second contentious Oval Office meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, wasted no time blaming both Democrats for the breakdown in negotiations designed to bring an end to the federal government’s shutdown, now entering its third week.

“Donald Trump’s done the impossible,” said Capitol Hill pundit Althea Thoone. “He’s painted himself into a corner in a room that has no corners – the Oval Office!”

Sen. Chuck Schumer called the President’s latest behavior a temper tantrum. “Unfortunately, the president just got up and walked out,” Schumer told a throng of waiting reporters. Trump reportedly threw papers on the floor and stormed away after Speaker Pelosi again denied Trump funding for his border wall.

The shutdown has been a particularly sticky wicket for the president, particularly after the trio’s first meeting, when Trump, seated beside a stoic Vice President Pence, told the two Democratic leaders that he would take the blame for the shutdown.

“He’s painted a picture of himself as this border security warrior,” said Thoone, “but he’s bristled during recent meetings with Pelosi and Schumer because of his refusal to back down on his principal campaign promise — to build the wall.”"

The turkeys, “Eric” and “Don Jr.”, will hopefully live out the rest of their days in obscurity after avoiding life sentences for their part in conspiring with a hostile foreign government to influence the 2016 Presidential election, obstructing justice and committing light treason (allegedly).

Mr. Trump will be announcing the pardons during a ceremony taking place in the White House Rose Garden. Melania and Barron will likely be in attendance.

This years pardons come on the heals of multiple pardons provided for equally jive-ass turkeys over the past two years by the Trump administration including disgraced former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio, serial perjurer Lewis “Scooter” Libby, and token foreign Conservative Dinesh D’ouza.

Other jive-ass turkeys likely being considered for pardons include Roger Stone Jr., General Michael Flynn, Jarod Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. The President is said to be discussing a preemptive pardon for himself as well.

According to legal professionals the pardoning of jive-ass turkeys at the federal level does nothing to protect them from being prosecuted at the state level."

While details of the shooter have not been released, Alex is likely spinning up all kinds of untruths in order to satisfy his legion of brain-dead followers.

“Was the shooter a Muslim? A Mexican? Antifa? BLM? A disgruntled employee? Was he radicalized by the gay agenda? Why did he hate Christians? Did anyone actually die? Are these the same crisis actors used during the Vegas shooting? Did you see that Craigslist ad recently seeking extras for a mass casualty exercise? How was Hillary involved? Could Obama have done more to prevent this attack? Did some crazed liberal shoot up this those folks to blame Trump and take away our guns? If this story is even true why did none of the victims shoot back?,” Alex likely opined during this afternoons editorial meeting.

The Washington Post broke the story stating the then 32 year-old Moore pursued a sexual relationship with Leigh Corfman outside a courtroom in Etowah County, Alabama in 1979.

The allegation, which includes 3 additional women between the ages of 16 and 18 and is supported by as many as 30 sources, sent shockwaves through the Republican Party forcing many high-ranking officials to respond on the record. Discussion quickly turned to the possibility of replacing Moore on the ballot, however Alabama law prohibits the replacement of a party candidate up to 76 days before the election.

Dan Stevens, a spokesman for the Alabama secretary of state’s office told National Report Thursday the role of Moore will instead be played by actor Christopher Plummer. Plummer recently became a hot Hollywood commodity after he was chosen to replace another alleged pedophile, Kevin Spacey, in the upcoming file “All the Money in the World.” He can, however, get all the money in the world by reading National Debt Relief reviews and more. It may not give him all the money in the world, but it sure is a great resource to help consolidate debt that can afford you more financial freedom.

Moore has denied the allegations and has taken to social media to blame the mainstream media, along with the “National Democratic Party” for what he considers to be a smear campaign.

National Report reached out to representatives for Mr. Plummer, but no response was received prior to publication."

After spending his entire life dwelling in the basement of his mother’s home, she had finally become fed up with her unmotivated son and gave Hollingsworth the boot.

The unemployed 35-year-old who has never lived on his own was clearly distressed when I spoke with him Wednesday. “She’s destroyed my life”, he exclaimed bitterly, staring at the photo in his clenched fist; A photograph of his family during happier times.

Duane has 3 younger siblings who have since gone on with their lives and become successful, driven adults, but Duane’s life just never seemed to take off. He remained content with frittering away his days playing video games and watching anime cartoons; Things that are mostly enjoyed by children. Duane is an adult male who just absolutely refuses to grow up.

After the death of Duane’s father 2 years ago, his mother Janice gave him an ultimatum: Either get a full-time job, enroll in college, or find somewhere else to live. After a handful of paltry attempts to secure employment at various fast-food establishments, it was clear that Duane would rather spend his time nestled among My Little Pony figurines in a musky basement than actually work for a living.

“It was clear he wasn’t serious about making a living for himself”, Janice explained. “He always had some excuse and frankly all these excuses were wearing very thin. I just wanted him out so I could enjoy retirement after having lost my husband. He was becoming an enormous financial burden and didn’t seem to care. Duane wouldn’t budge. He would frequently lash out and blame his siblings and myself for his lot in life.”

Eventually the moment of reckoning finally arrived in January of this year. Janice gave Duane 30 days to find somewhere else to live. “It was 30 days of pure hell. He stormed around the house screaming and crying. I could not believe what a spoiled brat he was at 35 years years of age! He always resented me for having more children after he was born. I suppose he just thought he would be the baby forever, but that clearly is not a healthy way for an adult to live.”

Duane finally found a tiny trailer for rent on the outskirts of town. He is currently supporting himself by selling off his vintage action figures and other collectibles on Ebay. He has also began taking steps to sue his own mother for damages, pain and suffering, emotional trauma and illegal eviction, all to the tune of 750k.

“I have PTSD now”, he exclaimed during our short interview. Duane sat across from me looking distressed and disheveled, wearing grimy gray sweatpants and a threadbare Power Rangers t-shirt which was clearly too small for his hulking frame. “My mother is going to pay for kicking me out! I had squatter’s rights! That was my lifelong home and my mother did nothing but torture me the whole time I was there! My parents neglected me when my other siblings were born so I totally deserve to stay there as long as I want! Nobody knows the hell I have endured!”

When questioned about the impending lawsuit being served up by her own son, Janice just shakes her head. “He only has himself to blame for his situation and obviously, he’s going to lose. Our only crime was being too nice and enabling this sort of behavior. Unfortunately, by coddling a weakling for far too long, I created a monster.”"

It has been reported that a disgruntled Twitter employee decided to delete the president’s account on their way out of the company, leaving ‘The Don’ Twitterless for roughly five whole minutes.

This absence was immediately noticed, and apparently gave many the false hope that Twitter was finally fed up with the 45th president’s late night flame wars with Hollywood liberals and had permanently banned him from their social media platform.

However, the page soon reappeared, and denizens of the net immediately began to recall how profoundly they were affected by the brief period of time in which the President’s Twitter page no longer hung over their lives like a cursed, blackened cloud, ready to strike them dead in 280 characters or less.

For scientific purposes I have saved some of these social media updates, and curiously found they all share a similar message of levity felt by those with the bizarre notion that Trump’s Twitter is somehow intrinsically linked to his role as President of the United States.

Let’s take a look, shall we?

Their year is either going exceptionally well, or Trump’s tweets are worse than mom’s recent cancer diagnosis.

A new medical condition will be added to the upcoming ICD-11 described as chronic pain associated with the president’s Twitter account.

Now tell us how you really feel!

They have…

Trump’s Twitter vanishing is equal to the blissful reprieve of Canzonetta sull’aria playing between repeated instances of prison rape.

For a moment it was like Hilary had won!

“Sorry, these tickets to Switzerland are great and all… But Trump’s Twitter being down for five minutes wins this year’s Best Birthday Present Award by a country mile!”

I can imagine Trump in the war room now. “Alright, we’re bombing North Korea, but first thing’s first: Delete my Twitter account!”

Because he totally wouldn’t still be the president!

I have a feeling this post was made by one of those freaks who write fan fiction about an alternate reality where Hilary Clinton is president.

Slate later went on to say, “now we know how African Americans felt after slavery was abolished!”

I guess the same person updates both Slate and Yahoo’s Facebook pages. “Just rearrange the sentences slightly, no one will notice!”

Hey! What was wrong with the old civil rights movement?!

You got your answer on Thursday: Exactly the same."

One that could possibly restore his tainted public image and help children around the world to avoid situations similar to the one that cost Trayvon Martin his life.

Zimmerman, along with collaborating illustrator, Gina Melosi have teamed-up to create a series of children’s books which we were told would be available sometime in early spring. The books illustrate scenarios involving dangerous situations in which a cast of colorful and mythical creatures instruct children on how to avoid perilous outcomes by doing the right thing.

Nancy Gearheart, founder and chief editor of Magic Island Publishing, was initially apprehensive about printing Zimmerman’s work, given the obvious controversy that’s surrounded him since the Trayvon Martin shooting, but she claims to have quickly had a change of heart upon having the chance to pore over George’s work.

“When George originally sent in his submission, I’ll have to admit, there was a lot of doubt there due to the fact that he had been embroiled in so much public outrage. It was not until I had a moment to really look at the books that I found them to be beautifully illustrated, each with such potent messages in regards to safety and self-awareness.”

“George is really hoping to redeem himself through these books as well and show the world he’s not a monster. I believe everyone deserves a second chance and once they see his work I am positive the public will be understanding and forgiving. It’s a win, win situation for everyone!”

Magic Island Publishing House are planning to release the first book in Zimmerman’s series titled “Dark Alley Dan and The Bad Bad Man” later this year.

Once the books go to print, Zimmerman also plans to tour several schools throughout Florida to in order to raise awareness about better ways children can avoid disaster in potentially dangerous situations."

The startling correlation was reported by millions of family planning centers nationwide after a 5 years study conducted by an exclusive research team led by Dr. Sandra McKinnon.

Dr. Sandra McKinnon reported the team’s findings during a recent US Reproductive Studies Symposium. “It is an undisputed fact that teen pregnancy rates are nearly non-existent when a woman reaches the age of 20. If you encourage your adolescents to abstain from sexual intercourse until they reach this age, the chances of them becoming teen mothers are incredibly slim–Almost nonexistent.

“While the parents are concerned with protecting their young daughters from badly-timed pregnancies, we’re concerned with finding the correlation between the age of 20, and it’s effect on teen pregnancy.”

Dr. McKinnons findings were hailed as “groundbreaking and revolutionary” by senior researchers who have been attempting to find ways to reduce teen pregnancy rates for 30 years.

“I have faith that this new information will really change the face of reproductive education.” Said Dr. Benjamin Harbo, President of the US Reproductive Studies Symposium. “I think these studies will empower young women to avoid early motherhood so that they can develop their lives and careers prior to making the choice to get pregnant.”

The findings gave others hope. Shelly Keaton, mother of 9 children had her first child at age 18. “To think if I would have just waited until I was 20. I would have never been a teen mother.” She continued, with tears in her eyes, “I want to protect other women from the situation I faced, because let me tell you, teen motherhood is no picnic. You could easily end up with a litter of children who you’re simply unable to support. I still have no idea how to feed all these kids. My life is chaos. Pure, never-ending chaos. Please, abstain from sex until you are 20. Then you may be able to bypass the troubles of teen pregnancy altogether.”"

The team today announced a boycott of the World Cup scheduled to be held in Russia Jun 14-Jul 15th, 2018. According to an inside source with no knowledge of US soccer, officials have announced the boycott in retaliation to Russian meddling in the 2016 Presidential election.

The decision was made late this afternoon following a devastating loss to the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago. The move marks the first time since 1986 the team will not be participating in the games.

According to Ms. Taylor, she met Mr. Weinstein at a Hollywood night club at the age of 19. As the night progressed she became increasingly intoxicated and found herself alone with the alleged serial harasser. In a sworn statement given to officials Ms. Taylor states, “Why was I not sexually assaulted by Mr. Weinstein? Was I not pretty enough? Did I do something wrong? I mean I may have been a bit overweight. Was I not worthy of being assaulted? These are all feelings I have struggled with since that fateful night.”

Bob Murphy, the attorney representing Ms. Taylor, had this to say, “I understand Joyce’s concerns, I mean she was in the right place at the right time, and feels she was entitled to be fondled, forced to perform fellatio, raped, something, anything. In a way I think we have all been assaulted by Mr. Weinstein.”

The New York Times describes Mr. Weinstein as follows:

“(He) helped to reinvent the model for independent films, with movies such as “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “The English Patient,” “Pulp Fiction,” “The Crying Game,” “Shakespeare in Love,” and “The King’s Speech.” Beyond Hollywood, he has exercised his influence as a prolific fund-raiser for Democratic Party candidates, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weinstein combined a keen eye for promising scripts, directors, and actors with a bullying, even threatening, style of doing business, inspiring both fear and gratitude. His movies have earned more than three hundred Oscar nominations, and, at the annual awards ceremonies, he has been thanked more than almost anyone else in movie history, just after Steven Spielberg and right before God.”

It is presumed there are more Joyce Taylor’s, possibly millions, out there waiting to tell their story of not being assaulted by Weinstein, however as of press time National Report was unable to find any additional non-victims. This development only leads to more confusion surrounding the multitude of accusers suggesting that they had in fact been sexually assaulted by Mr. Weinstein."

Trump.

The new Trojan Ultra-Thin Skin Scum Bag© will be available for a limited time and sold exclusively to novelty shops and truck stops nationwide. The Scum Bag© will come in two different shades of orange, regular & extra-dark, and be marketed towards “the small hands kinda guy.”

Trojan President Hugh Jardon said his company does not normally mix business with politics, but sees an opportunity to cash in on America’s fascination with all things Trump, especially after the real estate mogul himself brought his penis to the foreskin of American politics.

Jardon says Trump was a “no-brainer” when his marketing team asked if he had anyone in mind for the new ultra-thin skin dunce cap. “The Donald has the thinnest skin in the world, so from a marketing standpoint it just made perfect sense.” Asked if he was worried about a possible lawsuit from Trump, Jardon is confident Trojan’s legal department “took every precaution” to avoid any legal trouble. “Unlike Mr. Trump, I don’t have the skin of a bat wing. I can handle someone who challenges me or questions my decision making.”

The new Trojan Ultra-Thin Skin Scum Bag© will compete against other similar Trump novelty condoms currently flooding the marketplace, while offering consumers a higher standard of protection. Smaller men will now have a quality product to help them “overcomb their fear of pregnancy and STD’s” while still delivering “the highest sensitivity” the condom market has ever seen."

Trump has reportedly assured NJ Governor Chris Christie that, despite recent reports, he has not been banished from his inner circle, and will nominate the Bridgegate behemoth to the Supreme Food Court.

“Mr. Trump decided it would be humorous to have his little “Christie Kreme” (his new Secret Service name, according to insiders) around, so he created the special position just for him,” says Trump’s longtime attorney/bankruptcy expert, David Friedman.

In selecting Christie, 54, The Donald will be bringing in a “yes, I’ll have another” man that won’t clash with his own oversize, portly ego. “I think Mr. Trump wants Christie around just so he can humiliate him,” said Trump’s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, “and he knows he’ll do whatever he says, whenever he says to do it.”

Despite rumblings of a massive falling out between the two, those closest to the president-elect say otherwise.

Jared Kushner, the husband of Trump’s daughter Ivanka, said a Christie nomination would be a wise one, and would produce instant results. “Mr. Christie’s transition from the gravy train to the Trump train was seamless,” he said. “I think he would shake things up and make an enormous impact.”

Stephen Miller, who played a crucial role in Trump’s campaign, including drafting his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, says Christie has a “gargantuan-sized heart” and is “the perfect fit” for the new court.

“Governor Christie is not only ‘pro-life’, but he understands the birthing process better than anyone I know,” Miller said, “and as far as the 2nd Amendment is concerned, I’ve seen that guy conceal a .30-06 in the crease of his back fat. Trust me, there’s nothing to worry about.” Miller joked that Christie loves and supports the NRA almost as much as KFC. “He will step up to the plate, that’s for damn sure.”

While often referred to as the “butterball” of the “Grand Old Party Sub,” it appears Mr. Christie’s nomination to the Supreme Food Court is already a foregone conclusion."

Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte was on holiday in the south of France but returned immediately for an emergency meeting with the country’s National Security Council.

This comes amid a spate of mall attacks throughout the U.S., leaving many area shoppers and victim advocacy groups wondering how such a tasteless joke could ever make its way into print.

A spokesperson for the Fox Valley Mall told local reporters they had no knowledge of the ad and said an investigation is underway to determine where it may have originated from. However, the mall will still honor the 10% discount as advertised.

“Oh that’s a load of horsesh*t,” said a Fox Valley Mall employee who asked to remain anonymous. “There’s no way that ad just magically appeared in the Sunday paper,” he said, “this is the new age of viral marketing. Better get used to it.” The employee said the sleazy ad fits the mall owners M.O. perfectly. “They knew it would create a stir and get people talking, and that is exactly what’s happened.”

Roger Holloway, founder of the victim’s rights advocacy group Triggerz, agrees. “It’s that mentality that says anything is fair game in the name of profits. Hell, I wouldn’t put it past some of these shop owners to stage some sort of false flag attack to get the registers ringing again.”

Mr. Holloway says big chain stores like Starbucks are banking on the annual ‘War on Christmas’ hysteria to widen their year end profit margins. “They know that holiday cup and all the make-believe controversy that comes along with it is the key to their quarter’s earnings,” he said, “thank God for idiots who get offended year after year after year over a coffee cup eh?”

All calls to the investment group that owns the Fox Valley Mall have not been returned as of press time."

In the ‘Most Trustworthy’ category, Hillary scored a dismal 14% among active registered voters while Flint tap water scored a surprising 49%.





While the final tallies were a shock to many residents, MI Governor Rick Snyder isn’t surprised at all. “Well, what do you expect?” laughed Synder, “unlike the tap water in Flint, the folks here in Michigan can see right through that woman.”

Governor Snyder isn’t buying in to all the what he called “Hysterical hoopla” surrounding Flint’s water crisis, adding, “A lot of folks in Flint like to blame all of their problems on the water. We have a name for those types of people,” Snyder takes a pause for dramatic effect, “democrats.”

Oakland County resident Stanley Taylor agrees with the governor. “At some point you have to stop blaming the water for the fact your kids are dumb and lazy.” Asked if he was surprised by the survey results, Stan replied, “I would trust a fart after a Taco Bell run more than I’d ever trust Crooked Hillary.”

Past findings from the Make Michigan Great Again PAC were also critical of Mrs. Clinton’s trustworthiness. “Hillary’s lies affects children’s brain development resulting in reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioral changes such as shortening of attention span, increased antisocial behavior, and reduced educational attainment. Exposure to Hillary’s falsehoods can also cause anemia, hypertension, renal impairment, immunotoxicity and toxicity to reproductive organs.

In the ‘Most Trustworthy’ category, Hillary scored a dismal 14% among active registered voters while Flint tap water scored a surprising 49%.





While the final tallies were a shock to many residents, MI Governor Rick Snyder isn’t surprised at all. “Well, what do you expect?” laughed Synder, “unlike the tap water in Flint, the folks here in Michigan can see right through that woman.”

Governor Snyder isn’t buying in to all the what he called “Hysterical hoopla” surrounding Flint’s water crisis, adding, “A lot of folks in Flint like to blame all of their problems on the water. We have a name for those types of people,” Snyder takes a pause for dramatic effect, “democrats.”

Oakland County resident Stanley Taylor agrees with the governor. “At some point you have to stop blaming the water for the fact your kids are dumb and lazy.” Asked if he was surprised by the survey results, Stan replied, “I would trust a fart after a Taco Bell run more than I’d ever trust Crooked Hillary.”

Past findings from the Make Michigan Great Again PAC were also critical of Mrs. Clinton’s trustworthiness. “Hillary’s lies affects children’s brain development resulting in reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioral changes such as shortening of attention span, increased antisocial behavior, and reduced educational attainment. Exposure to Hillary’s falsehoods can also cause anemia, hypertension, renal impairment, immunotoxicity and toxicity to reproductive organs. The neurological and behavioral effects of Clinton’s lies are believed to be irreversible.”"

The blast occurred at approximately 4:45 pm leaving the victim, Anthony Stewart, 41, physically fine but emotionally drained. “The toll is a heavy one,” said a chaplain visiting the home.

A spokesperson for the Brown County Sheriff’s Department told the Green Bay Gazette that Amir Fahdi, 39, was questioned and released after multiple witnesses said he shouted “Allahu Akbar!” (God is Great) before launching the cyber attack outside a De Pere thrift shop.

Anthony said the onslaught began with a barrage of Facebook comments and soon erupted into a full-on mind fuck of emails, text messages, and gaming requests. “I barley know the guy,” said a shaken Stewart. “I updated my Facebook status with a Nirvana video and he became unhinged.”

“The motivation behind the assault has not yet been determined,” said Chad Manning, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. “We are exploring all possibilities of a potential motive,” he said.

Amir blew up Anthony’s Facebook page with practically a novella’s worth of comments about seeing Nirvana play live in the early nineties and even claimed to have hung out with the band in Madison, WI, while they recorded demo tracks for their mega-smash Nevermind album. “You could tell he was full of shit, but instead of calling him out I just typed ‘wow’ and ‘awesome’ hoping he’d get the hint and leave me alone,” Stewart said, “big mistake on my part.”

News of the explosion was reported by media organizations such as Breitbart, Infowars, and Fox News. A tweet Sunday morning from Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said: “I am deeply troubled by the bombing in De Pere. These stories cannot be swept under the rug #WIBombing.”

After several failed attempts to dodge Fahdi, a desperate Stewart told Amir he had to go care for his two-year-old son who may be coming down with a cold. “He wanted to come to my fucking house and treat him with homemade cold remedies. I was flabbergasted.”

It was then that Anthony checked his email account and discovered over 30 “ultra-rare” Nirvana MP3s had flooded his inbox. “This guy has serious issues,” said Stewart, “he may be radicalized.”

Brown County Deputy Daniel Benning said the public is not in danger and suggests that if anyone has any problems with Mr. Fahdi to simply ‘unfriend’ him and move on."

She didn’t have to. The way the slightly overweight feminist apologetically paused, fought back tears, and forced out a simple, “Stuff happened there,” told the story of the pain she’s been carrying since she first started fighting for gender equality almost two years ago.

Bradley’s troubles reached an apex the day she organized an anti-Donald Trump rally in Lubbock, Texas. Prudence and a group of fellow UW-M students made the long trek from Madison, WI, to protest Trump’s treatment of women in the Lone Star State.

Almost an hour into their protest, a man wearing a Make America Great Again hat and confederate flag suspenders approached her and screamed “feminazi f*ck pig” right to her face. For Mrs. Bradley, it was like being shot point blank in the face with a high-capacity assault weapon.

“I was in a state of total shock,” said Bradley, “I couldn’t feel my legs and thought I may have been paralyzed.” After being treated at a local medical facility for minor emotional distress, Prudence caught the first flight back home to seek a second opinion.

“Prudence was showing all the classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD,” said Dr. Liam Williams, Bradley’s family doctor in Madison. “Re-experiencing the trauma through intrusive and distressing recollections of the event, flashbacks, and nightmares are just some of Mrs. Bradley’s symptoms,” warned the doctor. “Prudence was also showing extreme emotional numbness that puts her in a very dangerous category of PTSD. It’s very important she start a treatment program immediately.”

The Bradley family researched treatment facilities across the country, hoping to find a program that would give their daughter the best overall chance at a full recovery. After almost a month of searching, the family were losing hope until an email from a wounded slacktivist suggested they call the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project® in Portland, Oregon.

The program provides personalized care, services, and advocacy to seriously wounded social justice warriors—including those who have suffered post traumatic stress disorder and other medical health conditions.

Besides adaptive and rehabilitative programs and caregiver support, the WSJWP also provides mentorship to recovering activists, an employment and career readiness program, and financial assistance for those who have suffered or aggravated an injury or illness and need help with daily living activities so they can avoid being hospitalized or put in an outpatient care facility.

For Prudence, the WSJWP has been a blessing. After a difficult and challenging three months in the program, Mrs. Bradley is starting to feel whole again, and is even looking forward to rejoining her fellow moonbats in time to protest the Republican National Convention next month in Cleveland, Ohio.

“I’ll be back,” said Mrs. Bradley with a new found sense of confidence. “I refuse to let these misogynists have the last laugh. This time I’ll be ready for them.” Prudence praises the WSJWP for giving her a second chance, not only at life, but a new sense of purpose to fight for social and economic justice. “This is my passion and I will never give up, ever.”

During an interview with the CBC Thursday morning, Trudeau made what some are calling an inappropriate joke about Bristol Palin while being asked about Republican Presidential front runner Donald Trump’s plan to build a wall along the Mexican border.

“I suppose Canada could build a wall around Bristol Palin’s vaginal cavity, but is that really going to stop Canadians from entering? I highly doubt it,” said Trudeau. Playing along, the interviewer asked who would pay for such a wall, with the PM adding, “How about all the fools who paid her six figures for an abstinence speech?”

A transcript of the interview was leaked to several independent media outlets, leading to an intern with CBC being fired. Trudeau’s spokesperson promptly issued an apology, stating: “The Prime Minister regrets making that analogy, and now realizes it was in poor taste. Mr. Trudeau has reached out to the Palin family to personally apologize.”

Bristol’s mother, former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, was quick to fire back at Trudeau via Twitter: “Thought you liberals were against slut shaming? Maybe a Canadian wall is not a bad idea. New PM is a vile looser [sic]! Boycott!!!

This is not the first time the Alaskardashians and Mr. Trudeau have crossed each other on social media. Last year when Trudeau became the second-youngest Prime Minister of Canada, Sarah blasted her neighbors of the north for electing what she called a “Liberal nightmare.” Trudeau shot back accusing Palin of being “One Brady short of a bunch,” and “a prime example why Americans need access to mental health care.”

Bristol Palin has taken online jabs at the PM on everything from accepting Syrian refugees to marijuana to abortion, even once poking fun at Trudeau for self identifying as a feminist.

However, Bristol hasn’t always been a such a harsh critic of Trudeau, once tweeting he was “smokin’ hot!” and “would ride his fuck rod” after a Twitter follower sent her a video of him stripping for charity. When pointed out the stripper’s identity, Bristol deleted the video, presumably embarrassed by the gaffe."

“As governor of Alaska, I banned Muslims from entering my daughter Bristol, and that ban is still enforced to this day,” Palin said. “Your first instinct as a parent is to protect your children, and that is what Donald Trump is trying to do, protect America from Muslim jihadists.”

Trump’s call for a “total and complete shutdown” on admitting Muslims in the U.S. drew condemnation from Republican opponents as well as Democrats. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle criticized the plan as impractical and unconstitutional.

Speaking with the Christian Broadcast Network (CBN) to promote her latest book ‘Sweet Freedom: A Devotional’, Palin spoke on a wide range of topics including Donald Trump, being fired from Fox News, and her daughter Bristol’s passion for wild, unprotected sex.

The former Fox News commentator opened up for the first time on why she was suddenly, and without warning, fired from the popular news network. “It was a shock, you betcha. I know why it happened. I called someone out, and this someone was not happy about it, which I go into further detail in my book,” Palin said.

A source close to Fox said this “someone” is Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly. Palin criticized the media (Fox) for exploiting the Duggar girls after their brother Josh Duggar was exposed as a child predator. The unnamed source also claims Palin was “a nightmare to work with” and was often “paranoid that everyone had an agenda against her.” The source adds that Palin “was rude and a diva, and thought that everyone else paled in comparison to her intelligence and savvy.”

Bristol is also back in the news after she urged college kids to start bringing guns with them to class. “Bristol is full of energy and spunk,” Palin added, “she’s always willing to try new things.”

Word broke early, spread quickly, and sent shock waves throughout the rock and roll community and the Republican Party, where Nugent, 68, is well-known for his fierce advocacy for conservative causes, unwavering support for the rights of gun owners and hunters, and ferocious loyalty and devotion to today’s true American patriots. The National Rifle Association issued the following statement:

Ted Nugent has proudly and patriotically served on the NRA’s board of directors since 1995. The Association shares a deep sense of shock with our 4.5 million members and countless millions of supporters as details of this catastrophic event continue to unfold.

PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), one of several organizations Nugent violently criticized in the past, also issued a statement expressing condolences.

Originally from Detroit, Michigan, Nugent initially found fame as lead guitarist for The Amboy Dukes before embarking on a solo career. Highlights from Nugent’s life include a 1977 interview appearing in High Times magazine, in which he famously told a reporter how he avoided the [Viet Nam War] draft: he did not bathe, brush his teeth, or shave for 30 days leading up to his pre-induction physical. To sweeten the pot, he also defecated in his pants. “I was so proud,” Nugent recalled. In later years he denied those accounts, saying he made up the story to trick the gullible reporter. That same year, Nugent’s song Cat Scratch Fever dominated the rock and roll charts.

President Obama, the target of many of Nugent’s negative comments, reportedly expressed astonishment when informed during a cabinet meeting that Nugent had lived another day. During the White House’s daily media briefing, Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz informed the assembled press corps that the President asked members of his cabinet to join him in a moment of silence to acknowledge Nugent’s survival.

Throughout Detroit and surrounding suburbs, fans both old and new erected makeshift tributes to the rocker, lighting candles, singing songs, and leaving cards and ticket stubs from many of Nugent’s concerts as testimonials to a life still lived.

** UPDATE: COSBY ADMITTED TO DRUGGING WOMEN IN 2005 DEPOSITION **

According to Ms. Taylor, she once met with Mr. Cosby decades ago at a Hollywood night club at the age of 17. As the night progressed, she became increasingly intoxicated before her boyfriend, 18 year-old Danny Stevens, helped her home where she awoke the next morning alone, with full memory of what had not transpired the night before. In a sworn statement given to officials earlier today, Ms. Taylor states, “Why was I not raped by Mr. Cosby? Was I not pretty enough? Did I do something wrong? I mean I may have been a bit overweight, but I was still rapeable (sic). These are all feelings I have struggled with since that fateful night in 1974.”









Bob Murphy, the attorney representing Ms. Taylor, had this to say, “I understand Joyce’s concerns, I mean she was in the right place at the right time, and feels she was entitled to be raped, but in a way, I think we have all been raped by Mr. Cosby.”

Since November, at least 15 women have come forward claiming to have been sexually assaulted by Cosby. Cosby, who starred as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on “The Cosby Show” from 1984 to 1992, has not been formally charged in connection with any of the allegations and has denied his involvement.

Cosby’s career has unraveled since the allegations began and he has hired an extensive team of Public Relations experts in attempt to save what is left of his reputation going so far as to blame the victims themselves.

In the years since the non-incident took place, Joyce Taylor has sought counseling and has been treated for depression. “The last forty years, my weight’s gone up and down like a yo-yo.” When “The Cosby Show” went off the air in ’92 I got things under control, but when he came back with another show four years later, I blew up like a damn balloon. Now he’s in the news again and I’m fighting the urge to ‘make the plate my mate.’ It’s a struggle,” admitted Taylor, “but I’m not going to turn not being raped by Bill Cosby into a negative.”

It is presumed there are many more Joyce Taylor’s, possibly millions, out there waiting to tell their story of not being raped by Cosby, however as of press time National Report was unable to find any additional victims. This development only leads to more confusion surrounding the multitude of accusers suggesting that they had in fact been raped by Mr. Cosby.

Cosby’s publicist David Brokaw and lawyer Martin Singer did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

Cosby’s career has unraveled since the allegations began and he has hired an extensive team of Public Relations experts in attempt to save what is left of his reputation going so far as to blame the victims themselves.

In the years since the non-incident took place, Joyce Taylor has sought counseling and has been treated for depression. “The last forty years, my weight’s gone up and down like a yo-yo.” When “The Cosby Show” went off the air in ’92 I got things under control, but when he came back with another show four years later, I blew up like a damn balloon. Now he’s in the news again and I’m fighting the urge to ‘make the plate my mate.’ It’s a struggle,” admitted Taylor, “but I’m not going to turn not being raped by Bill Cosby into a negative.”

It is presumed there are many more Joyce Taylor’s, possibly millions, out there waiting to tell their story of not being raped by Cosby, however as of press time National Report was unable to find any additional victims. This development only leads to more confusion surrounding the multitude of accusers suggesting that they had in fact been raped by Mr. Cosby.

Cosby’s publicist David Brokaw and lawyer Martin Singer did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

Scientists at the Wyoming Institute of Technology, a privately-owned think tank located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, discovered that energy radiated from the sun isn’t merely captured in solar panels, but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels, in a process they refer to as “forced photovoltaic drainage.”

“Put into laymen’s terms, the solar panels capture the sun’s energy, but pull on the sun over time, forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing,” WIT claims in a scientific white paper published on Wednesday. “Imagine a waterfall, dumping water. But you aren’t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, you’re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.”





WIT is adamant that there’s no immediate danger, however. “Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we’d start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.”

The study was commissioned in August 2011 by the Halliburton corporation, who wanted to learn if the energy giant should start manufacturing and selling solar panels domestically and internationally. Halliburton’s executives wanted to know more about the sustainability of solar energy and how photovoltaic technology might evolve over the next ten years. But based on the findings of WIT’s research in the field, Halliburton revealed on Friday that they will not be entering the solar energy market.

“Solar panels destroying the sun could potentially be the worst man-made climate disaster in the history of the world, and Halliburton will not be taking part in that,” the company stated in a press release issued Friday morning. “It’s obvious, based on the findings of this neutral scientific research group, that humans needs to become more dependent on fossil fuels like oil and coal, not less. Because these so-called `green technologies’ are far more dangerous to the Earth than any hydrofracking operation or deep-water drilling station. What good is clean air when our very sun is no longer functional?”"

While Virginia has long struggled with racism, momentum in support of the blackface community really picked up this week after a racist photograph surfaced on the yearbook page of Governor Ralph Northam. Northam has denied being in the photograph, but his denial fell flat after he confessed to having dressed in blackface for a Texas dance competition where he impersonated Michael Jackson by painting his face with shoe polish.

Fresh off the Northam news, Attorney General Mark Herring, second in line to assume the governorship of the Commonwealth, today admitted to dressing in blackface when he was a 19-year-old college student at the University of Virginia in 1980. Herring, who was among those calling on Northam to resign, said he was “deeply, deeply sorry for the paint that I cause with this revelation.”

Virginia’s Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax, widely considered for the position of Governor in the event Northam resigns, has found himself in the midst of sexual assault allegations. No word on whether or not Democrats in the state will support his candidacy following the allegations.

National Report reached out to the head of the Virginia Legislative Blackface Caucus, but no response was provided prior to publication.

Donald J. Trump, fresh from a second contentious Oval Office meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, wasted no time blaming both Democrats for the breakdown in negotiations designed to bring an end to the federal government’s shutdown, now entering its third week.

“Donald Trump’s done the impossible,” said Capitol Hill pundit Althea Thoone. “He’s painted himself into a corner in a room that has no corners – the Oval Office!”

Sen. Chuck Schumer called the President’s latest behavior a temper tantrum. “Unfortunately, the president just got up and walked out,” Schumer told a throng of waiting reporters. Trump reportedly threw papers on the floor and stormed away after Speaker Pelosi again denied Trump funding for his border wall.

The shutdown has been a particularly sticky wicket for the president, particularly after the trio’s first meeting, when Trump, seated beside a stoic Vice President Pence, told the two Democratic leaders that he would take the blame for the shutdown.

“He’s painted a picture of himself as this border security warrior,” said Thoone, “but he’s bristled during recent meetings with Pelosi and Schumer because of his refusal to back down on his principal campaign promise — to build the wall.”"

The turkeys, “Eric” and “Don Jr.”, will hopefully live out the rest of their days in obscurity after avoiding life sentences for their part in conspiring with a hostile foreign government to influence the 2016 Presidential election, obstructing justice and committing light treason (allegedly).

Mr. Trump will be announcing the pardons during a ceremony taking place in the White House Rose Garden. Melania and Barron will likely be in attendance.

This years pardons come on the heals of multiple pardons provided for equally jive-ass turkeys over the past two years by the Trump administration including disgraced former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio, serial perjurer Lewis “Scooter” Libby, and token foreign Conservative Dinesh D’ouza.

Other jive-ass turkeys likely being considered for pardons include Roger Stone Jr., General Michael Flynn, Jarod Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. The President is said to be discussing a preemptive pardon for himself as well.

According to legal professionals the pardoning of jive-ass turkeys at the federal level does nothing to protect them from being prosecuted at the state level."

“Was the shooter a Muslim? A Mexican? Antifa? BLM? A disgruntled employee? Was he radicalized by the gay agenda? Why did he hate Christians? Did anyone actually die? Are these the same crisis actors used during the Vegas shooting? Did you see that Craigslist ad recently seeking extras for a mass casualty exercise? How was Hillary involved?

Surprise Thanksgiving Roasts

One great way to involve folks in holiday oriented entertainment is to make the tried-and-true Thanksgiving meal into an unwitting scavenger hunt! Similar to the traditional Mardi Gras King’s cake, in which a small coin or figure of baby Jesus is hidden inside, we recommend you hide something small or unexpected inside of at least one of the main dishes or desserts. Staff picks include a set of false teeth submerged in Great Aunt Muriel’s homemade cherry cheesecake, or a modest bag of mixed prescription medication concealed in the mashed potatoes.

Once these unanticipated objects have been discovered, announce the finder as the subject of a brutal holiday roast! This game is a hilarious idea for all-inclusive entertainment, as everyone can criticize and berate the winner under the pretense of light-hearted ribbing, providing hours of amusement, and an acceptable excuse to dish out both emotional abuse, while creating fond memories for years to come.

Truth Or Dare

Do you suspect your family and/or friends are holding out on some dark secrets or privy to juicy need-to-know gossip? Well, there’s no better way to really know your loved ones more intimately than to play an alcohol-fueled variant of truth or dare, also known as Spin the Bottle! If alcohol may not be effective for the family that already regularly drinks together, just use the CIA’s favorite truth serum, Scopolamine, and spike their drinks.

Of course, children must be excluded from this game due to its adult themes, so I suggested you shut them away in a distant room as to prevent any trauma due to all the familial skeletons figuratively pouring out of the closet. Who knew that Aunt Terri actually DID get rid of Uncle Berry for his $100,000 life insurance policy, and that he wasn’t simply a victim of an unfortunate, and unsolved hit-and-run accident? You never know what you might learn about your family’s history!

Outdoor Scavenger Hunt

Like most Thanksgiving celebrations, it is likely your guests have had at least two other meals under their belt before the main event. Consequently, in order to work up a genuine appetite for your Thanksgiving spread, have them embark on a harrowing scavenger hunt through a rented corn maze! (The bigger, the better.) Not only will it make them feel genuinely thankful for all the work you’ve done to host this holiday event but also provide you with enough time to actually finish the cooking!

Provide your party with a flare gun and a small flashlight in case they get lost in the maze, or are unable to understand the clues you’ve dispersed randomly around the cornfield. That way they can find each other, and hopefully signal for help as darkness falls. The first ones out of the maze get to have the initial choice of their favorite foods, while the last to finish have to wash all the dishes, providing them with plenty of incentive to participate!

Cosplay

Our next suggestion is to recreate an authentic Thanksgiving holiday by cosplaying as your favorite pilgrims from the Mayflower, complete with costumes and a vastly limited spread of food reminiscent of a meager Paleolithic diet. Hire real Native Americans to sit alongside your family and eat with you, just as they had with the pilgrims!

Keep it traditional by trading them in dried corn, glass beads, and firewater for their service, and insist that they too attend the meal in historically accurate attire, such as leather loincloths, feathered headbands and a necklace of real human scalps.

Invite The Homeless

Turn your house into a surprise soup kitchen for the disenfranchised and unfortunate without informing your guests before they arrive!

Before turning your homestead into an impromptu food trough for the poor and downtrodden, it is highly recommended that you put up chicken wire to prevent them from getting into undesirable areas, such as your organic tomato garden, underwear drawer or medicine cabinet.

Thanksgiving is full of human-interest pieces and Facebook images about selfless individuals providing hot meals to the needy on a day known for generosity and goodwill. Bring this instant karmic good luck to you and all your loved ones by getting them unknowingly involved with your philanthropic endeavors. Put them on the spot as they are surrounded by shambling drug addicts and the streams of urine left in their wake. They will not be able to refuse an opportunity to brag about their charitable and selfless holiday on the nearest social media platform, especially before starting their Black Friday binge shopping!"
http://nationalreport.net/,http://nationalreport.net/study-claims-women-abandon-feminism-finding-meaningful-relationships-men/#comments,2017-11-14T16:00:05-08:00,Study Claims Women Abandon Feminism After Finding Meaningful Relationships With Men - National Report,"Women who remain die-hard feminists well into adulthood are oftentimes the least desirable specimens, science now claims.

“The only relationships they have are often ones with other females who subscribe to the same strict ideologies, and serve as echo chambers for extremist thought. The stereotype of overweight, unattractive, bitter, resentful hags with a chip on their shoulder isn’t really too far from the truth,” said Sheila Baker, director of the Garrison Institute located in Langford, Mississippi.

“Women who quickly abandon feminism are just happier in the long run,” Harman told National Report. “Once they engage in a healthy relationship with a member of the opposite sex, 78% of women realize that they had been brainwashed via college campuses and social media. They’re ashamed of having associated with a mob of mentally-ill whiners and seek to distance themselves from that lifestyle as much as possible.”

After graduating high school, Sheila Baker was accepted into at a well-known liberal college located in the Pacific Northwest, attended primarily by the offspring of affluent families. Even then, feminism was the social justice ’cause du jour’ amongst bleeding-heart upper class young adults with no worldly perspective or experience. “It’s true. I identified as a feminist in college,” Baker blushingly confessed. “It’s really rather embarrassing to admit now. I marched in the marches. I blogged with the best of them. I was full of entitlement and resentment towards what I thought at the time was the source of all the world’s ills: The Patriarchy. In particular, white males. The only real exposure I had to the less fortunate was through my textbooks. Instructors basically fanned the flames by telling us that all sources of oppression and strife within’ the world were due to privileged Caucasians.

You get a bunch of impressionable white kids together who are in a rebellious frame of mind and tell them that the families they grew up with are basically responsible for everything that is wrong with the world and I can guarantee the outcome is not going to be a healthy one.”

And the horror stories don’t stop there says Sheila, who claims she has heard thousands of stories which ring similarly to her own. And far too many of those tales result in permanent damage to the woman, her personal life, and familial relationships.

Barker went on to elaborate upon one particular instance in which a woman became so wrapped up in feminism that she was disowned by her family, eventually leading to her untimely demise at the hands of an intentional overdose.

“We’ll call this woman K.C. out of respect,” Sheila began. “We were close friends in college, and even by my own admittedly very liberal standards, she was quite extreme. Always talking about how men should be castrated and put in labor camps. She updated her social media with misandrist hate speech, and even went onto violently attack her younger brother when he accidentally misgendered one of her friends.

During this time K.C. intentionally gained 200 pounds in what she called her fight against beauty stereotypes. What was once a beautiful, attractive young girl had permanently mutilated herself with facial tattoos, piercings, and morbid obesity.”

Sheila Baker will be releasing her findings in an upcoming interview with OUT Magazine, as well as a 30 state tour to sign the accompanying book which goes into even more detail as to why young women fall into the treacherous trap of liberalism, and how to reclaim their lives from commie parasites, and other damaging ideologies which prey on a misguided desire to make the world a better place, all while paving the hell."
https://www.snopes.com/,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/03/23/sen-rand-paul-kept-working-for-six-days-after-virus-test/,2020-03-23T00:00:00,Sen. Rand Paul Kept Working for Six Days after Virus Test,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul says he was tested a week ago for the novel coronavirus, but continued working at the Capitol because he had no symptoms of the illness and believed it was “highly unlikely” he was sick. Paul also said he did not have direct contact with anyone who tested positive for the virus or was sick.

Paul announced Sunday that he had tested positive for the virus, becoming the first case of COVID-19 in the Senate and raising fears about further transmission of the virus among senators, including more than two dozen who are in their 70’s or 80’s.

Paul’s refusal to self-quarantine after being tested sparked bipartisan outrage, including from some of his colleagues. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona, chastised Paul on Twitter, saying his decision to return to the Capitol before he learned the test results was “absolutely irresponsible.”

Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., retweeted Sinema’s comments and said she “couldn’t agree more. As we ask all Americans to sacrifice their livelihoods and alter their behavior to save lives, we must ourselves model appropriate #coronavirus behavior. No one is too important to disregard guidance to self-quarantine pending test results.”

Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a former health policy adviser to President Barack Obama, said Monday that Paul, an eye surgeon, “did just about everything wrong” by not self-quarantining in the days before his test results came back.

“What I’m really upset about is he’s a physician, and he ought to know best in the whole Senate,” Emanuel told MSNBC.

Paul defended his actions in a statement Monday. Since most senators travel frequently by plane and attend “lots of large gatherings, I believed my risk factor for exposure to the virus to be similar to that of my colleagues, especially since multiple congressional staffers on the Hill had already tested positive weeks ago,” he said.

“For those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine, realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a tee, I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol,” Paul added. Current federal guidelines would not have called for him to get tested or quarantined, Paul said.

“It was my extra precaution, out of concern for my damaged lung, that led me to get tested,” he said.

Paul, 57, had surgery last year to remove part of a lung damaged in a 2017 assault by a neighbor who attacked him over a long-standing landscaping dispute. Paul broke several ribs in the incident and was later awarded $580,000 in damages and medical expenses.

Paul said his decision to get tested was not related to his attendance at a Mar. 7 fundraiser for a Louisville art museum. Two event attendees have tested positive for COVID-19, but Paul said he “never interacted with the two individuals even from a distance.”

“Perhaps it is too much to ask that we simply have compassion for our fellow Americans who are sick or fearful of becoming so.” he said in the statement released by his office. “Thousands of people want testing. Many … are sick with flu symptoms and are being denied testing. This makes no sense.”

Paul went into quarantine Sunday after learning his results.

His announcement led Utah’s two GOP senators — Mike Lee and Mitt Romney — to place themselves into quarantine, stepping away from negotiations as the Senate worked on a $1.4 trillion economic rescue package for the coronavirus crisis. At least five senators, including Paul, are in self-quarantine.

Paul was on Capitol Hill this past week, including at a luncheon Friday among GOP senators. He spoke on the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon, addressing the cornonavirus and a failed amendment he sponsored that would have paid for virus relief efforts by withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan.

A spokesman for Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said Moran briefly saw Paul at the Senate gym Sunday morning and shared that information with GOP colleagues. Moran “followed CDC guidelines and kept a safe distance between him and Sen. Paul,” spokesman Tom Brandt said. Moran has spoken with the attending physician at the Capitol and has been told he does not need to self-quarantine, Brandt said.

In a tweet Sunday, Sinema said Paul acted irresponsibly: “You cannot be near other people while waiting for coronavirus test results. It endangers others & likely increases the spread of the virus.”

Other senators, including Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, had gone into self-quarantine while they awaited the results of a coronavirus test. Both were negative.

A day after Paul’s announcement, calls grew among senators for remote voting. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, tweeted that “I totally support” the idea and said the change should be made before the Senate leaves town. First-term Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., tweeted that “extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. It is time to bring the Senate into the 21st century.”

Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Dick Durbin of Illinois have put forward a bipartisan resolution to amend Senate rules to allow senators to vote remotely during a national crisis.

“At some point (remote voting) is going to become inevitable,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who announced Monday that her husband has coronavirus."
https://www.snopes.com/,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/03/23/loss-of-smell-taste-might-signal-pandemic-virus-infection/,2020-03-23T00:00:00,"Loss of Smell, Taste, Might Signal Pandemic Virus Infection","NEW YORK (AP) — A loss of smell or taste might be an early sign of infection with the pandemic virus, say medical experts who cite reports from several countries.

It might even serve as a useful screening tool, they say.

The idea of a virus infection reducing sense of smell is not new. Respiratory viral infection is a common cause of loss of smell, because inflammation can interfere with airflow and the ability to detect odors. The sense of smell usually returns when the infection resolves, but in a small percentage of cases, smell loss can persist after other symptoms disappear. In some cases, it is permanent.

Now, there’s “good evidence” from South Korea, China and Italy for loss or impairment of smell in infected people, says a joint statement from the presidents of the British Rhinological Society and of ENT UK, a British group that represents ear, nose and throat doctors. In South Korea, some 30% of people who tested positive for the virus have cited loss of smell as their major complaint in otherwise mild cases, they wrote.

So that might be useful as a way to spot infected people without other symptoms — fever, coughing and shortness of breath — of the new coronavirus, they wrote.

A similar proposal was published Sunday by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. It noted “rapidly accumulating” anecdotal evidence from around the world that the pandemic virus can cause not only loss of smell but also a diminished sense of taste. So the appearance of those symptoms in people without another explanation should alert doctors to the possibility of a COVID-19 infection, the group said.

Maria Van Kerkhove, an outbreak expert at the World Health Organization, told reporters Monday that the U.N. health agency is looking into the question of whether the loss of smell or taste are a defining feature of the disease.

Dr. Eric Holbrook, an expert on nasal and sinus disease at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear hospital in Boston, said the reports have been a hot topic among researchers and doctors. But “we don’t have hard evidence right now” about how often smell loss occurs in people infected with the pandemic virus, he said in an interview Monday.

Holbrook said the reports he has seen suggest the sense of smell returns within a couple weeks, but how long it lasts has yet to be firmly established.

He also said it’s difficult to assess reports of a loss of taste because people with an impaired sense of smell often report a loss of flavor, which is technically different from an impairment in taste.

Holbrook said he is trying to set up a study of smell in people being tested for the coronavirus at Boston-area hospitals."
https://www.snopes.com/,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/03/23/mormons-chided-for-airport-welcoming-of-missionaries/,2020-03-23T00:00:00,Mormons Chided for Airport Welcoming of Missionaries,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Hours after hundreds of people welcoming missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints crowded together in an airport parking garage, authorities Monday announced new rules to prevent it from happening again during the coronavirus crisis.

The people who showed up Sunday at the Salt Lake City Airport and stood shoulder-to-shoulder, some hugging arriving loved ones, should have heeded warnings to keep their distance to help prevent the spread of the virus, said critics of the gathering including U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, Utah’s governor and lieutenant governor and the church itself.

While Utah residents welcoming returning missionaries are an airport tradition, officials this time asked for only one or two family members of each returning missionary to come and to stay in their cars — guidance that wasn’t followed by many people, said airport spokeswoman Nancy Volmer.

Church officials said in a letter that they appreciate the love and care from families and acknowledge these are “unprecedented times” but made clear what happened can’t occur again.

“What occurred Sunday afternoon at the Salt Lake airport causes us deep concern with missionaries and their families disregarding important instructions regarding self-isolation and congregating at airports,” the letter said.

Under new rules announced Monday afternoon by Salt Lake City officials, only one car per returning missionary will be allowed at a designated spots in the garage. Airport staff will direct the missionaries to the designated spot while airport security will ensure compliance. The city rules were agreed to by the city, church and the airport.

Video and photos showed many people inside the parking garage standing much closer to each other than the recommended “social distancing” measure of 6 feet (1.8 meter) apart.

“This is irresponsible,” Romney wrote on Facebook. “Parents, please pick up your missionary from the airport alone and help them strictly follow self-quarantine procedures for their first 14 days at home. We need to work together to keep our communities safe.”

The first-term Republican senator has put himself in quarantine because he sat next to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who tested positive for COVID-19.

For most people, coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover.

The 900 missionaries who arrived at the airport were returning from the Philippines on chartered flights. Thousands more missionaries are expected to return from abroad in the coming days and weeks after the Utah-based faith said Friday it was bringing home an unspecified but “substantial” number of missionaries.

Utah Gov. Gary Herbert called the airport event “dangerous” in a tweet and Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox said he was “really disappointed in the behavior we saw from missionary families at the SLC airport tonight.”

“I get it, I’ve been there (and still have a child serving), but this is unacceptable. In a time of shared sacrifice, we must do better to save lives,” said Cox, a member of the faith widely known as the Mormon church, as are Romney and Hebert.

Rep. John Curtis tweeted a video of the gathering with the caption, “Watch the below video for what NOT to do.”

The church posted a statement online Sunday night urging parents to go alone to pick up their family members and to maintain recommended distance apart from them and for the missionaries go into 14 days of self isolation.

Regional church leaders were told Saturday to tell parents to take only one vehicle to the airport and stay in their cars, church spokesman Daniel Woodruff said.

There are no confirmed cases of coronavirus among the missionaries, said Woodruff, declining to comment on the criticism from Romney and the other political leaders.

It is a tradition for large groups of family and friends to squeeze into the arrivals greeting area at Salt Lake City airport’s to welcome home missionaries with signs, screams of joy and balloons. The official reaction to Sunday’s event illustrated how religions are being forced to alter customs amid the spread of the coronavirus.

The church’s proselytizing missions are an integral part of the religion and considered rites of passages for young members. Men serve two years while women serve 18 months. There were about 65,000 people serving missions before the coronavirus pandemic started.

The church has said it does not plan to suspend its missionary program. The faith is sending home many missionaries serving or preparing to serve in foreign countries so they can self-isolate for 14 days and be reassigned to continue on missions in their home countries."

Browse our coronavirus fact checks here . Tell us about any questionable or concerning rumors and “advice” you encounter here.

Copied-pasted-and-shared social media posts allegedly written by anonymous experts have been a central feature of the misinformation epidemic associated with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. These posts, which frequently promote suspect advice or inaccurate information, evolve into multiple, slightly modified versions and have frequently gone viral on social media platforms.

At issue here is one such post displayed below, which has been attributed to, among others, “an immunologist at Johns Hopkins University.” The post usually begins this way: “Feeling confused as to why Coronavirus is a bigger deal than Seasonal flu? Here it is in a nutshell. I hope this helps. Feel free to share this to others who don’t understand… It has to do with RNA sequencing…. I.e. genetics.”

The post makes several points, but only a few are accurate.

A majority of the claims rest on the false assumption that the coronavirus mutates at a faster rate than other viruses. Below we will go through the post point-by-point.

‘All Human Virus’

The post asserts that, unlike the seasonal flu, this novel coronavirus mutated from a viral strain originally found in an animal and therefore no human’s immune system recognizes the virus. This differs from the seasonal flu, according to the post’s author, as most humans have some innate level of immunity to influenza strains in general. This is true, according to experts.

Matt Koci, a professor of immunology, virology, and host-pathogen interactions at North Carolina State University told us by email that while “biology is more complicated than that,” the “lack of no one in the human population having any prior immunity to is a major factor to why this is so much worse than seasonal flu.” Another factor, he told us, is that a few anti-viral drugs have been developed that blunt the impact of some influenza strains, but no such tool exists for the coronavirus.

Animal-to-Human Mutation in ‘Just Two Weeks’

The post asserts that mutations in the RNA or DNA of a virus sometimes allow for animal-to-human transfer, but not human-to-human transfer. It then implies a second mutation event is required to allow for human-to-human transfer, and therefore a possible pandemic, to occur:

Now, here comes this Coronavirus. It existed in animals only, for nobody knows how long. But one day, at an animal market in Wuhan China, in December 2019, it mutated and made the jump from animal to people. At first, only animals could give it to a person. But here is the scary part. In just TWO WEEKS, it mutated again and gained the ability to jump from human to human. Scientists call this quick ability, “slippery”.

While most viruses mutate multiple times in the process that allows transfer between animal-human and then human-human, “there is no data that I’m aware of that supports the details in this statement,” Koci told us. “We still don’t know what animal it ‘jumped from’ so there is no way to know how long it took before it evolved the ability to move from person-to-person,” he explained. The virus most closely resembles a coronavirus found in bats.

In fact, this virus may have been pretty much perfectly set up to infect humans right off the bat, so to speak, and therefore would not have required the alleged multiple quick mutations to produce human-to-human transfer. Speaking to Ed Young in The Atlantic, Matthew Friedman of the University of Maryland School of Medicine explained that this novel coronavirus differs from the coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak because this one required no modifications to thrive in human cells after its jump from animal to human. Unlike the coronavirus that caused the original SARS, this new one already possessed the ability to recognize a key protein in human cells named ACE2. “It had already found its best way of being a [human] virus,” he told The Atlantic.

‘This Virus is Slippery AF’

The post claims that a quick ability to mutate allowed the virus to mutate “in such a way the way [sic] that it causes great damage to human lungs” and that this fast mutation rate is “why Coronavirus is different from seasonal flu, or H1N1, or any other type of influenza.” The post asserts that the coronavirus, compared to other viruses, mutates unusually fast, i.e. that it is “slippery AF.” This is not true.

“The virus has been remarkably stable given how much transmission we’ve seen,” Lisa Gralinski, a professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina, said in the same Atlantic interview. “That makes sense,” she said, referring to its strong initial ability to infect human cells “because there’s no evolutionary pressure on the virus to transmit better. It’s doing a great job of spreading around the world right now.” David Ho, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, also made this point in a Q and A interview. “This virus is mutating but it has mutated very little so far,” he said.

“This virus does not seem to mutate any faster than we would expect,” Koci concurred. “It is mutating, all viruses do, and over time, the randomness of these mutations may spit out a new variant that is worse, but current rates of mutations do not seem unusual for these types of viruses. Mutation rates also do not have anything to do with the damage COVID-19 causes to the lungs in some individuals, according to Ho. “There are differences [in various strains],” he said, “but probably they are functionally not important, so that’s not the explanation for why you see different disease courses among the infected,” he said.

The Mutation Rate Makes It Hard to Develop a Vaccine for COVID-19

The post accurately asserts that there are now two primary strains of the novel coronavirus, but inaccurately suggests this is unusual or a central problem in developing a vaccine for the virus:

It’s already mutated AGAIN, so that we now have two strains to deal with, strain S and strain L…which makes it twice as hard to develop a vaccine.

While multiple strains may complicate vaccine production efforts, it is unclear if the two present strains “are different enough that they would need separate vaccines or not,” Koci told us. More important, mutation rates and multiple strains would not be the reason for the potentially long time frame in the development of a coronavirus vaccine.

Influenza, as a comparison, mutates season to season, and epidemiologists are able to predict with varying degrees of accuracy which strains will spread each season thanks to a massive and international monitoring effort that collects data for this purpose. This information guides the production of flu shots for a given season.

“We do this for [the] flu, so we should be able to do it for this [novel coronavirus] too. The difference,” Koci told us, “is we’ve been studying [the] flu for almost 100 years. We have a pretty good idea of how we need to change the vaccine each year to keep pace. It may take a while until we understand the differences in coronavirus strains at the same level, but we’ll get there.” Given the tools modern science has and the number of labs working on the problem world wide, Koci believes “we will catch up to where we are with our understanding of [the] flu pretty quick.

If It Mutates Again, Who Is to Say What It Will Do Next?

The post ends with a combination of good advice and misleading scare statements. The majority of the viral Facebook story is predicated on the false belief that the novel coronavirus mutates at a faster rate than other viral pathogens like influenza or even previous coronaviruses. There is no evidence to support that, in part because this novel coronavirus was, improbably, perfectly adapted to infect humans from the outset.

The fear, then, is not of an unknown about how mutations could change the disease to make it even more scary. Instead, the central fear expressed by many epidemiologists is that the public will not take the necessary precautions to slow its spread and, as a result, will overload the health system. That a large population of people will likely be infected with this disease in the coming year is likely, but how deadly that infection could be depends in large part on slowing the rate at which people develop new infections.

The reason for this is to create conditions that allow for these inevitable new cases to occur over a broader period of time, not all at once in a way that overloads the medical care system of a region. In the hard hit areas of northern Italy, the outbreak of new infections took place in a dangerously short period of time, necessitating hard decisions like denying ventilators to older patients less likely to survive. Staying at home is not only about preventing yourself from infection, it is, in most cases, primarily about preventing yourself from infecting multiple other individuals in a short period of time. In that light, the final point made in this viral post is a good one: “Stay home folks.”"
https://www.snopes.com/,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/03/23/testing-blunders-crippled-us-response-as-coronavirus-spread/,2020-03-23T00:00:00,Testing Blunders Crippled US Response as Coronavirus Spread,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A series of missteps at the nation’s top public health agency caused a critical shortage of reliable laboratory tests for the coronavirus, hobbling the federal response as the pandemic spread across the country like wildfire, an Associated Press review found.

President Donald Trump assured Americans early this month that the COVID-19 test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is “perfect” and that “anyone who wants a test can get a test.” But more than two months after the first U.S. case of the new disease was confirmed, many people still cannot get tested.

In the critical month of February, as the virus began taking root in the U.S. population, CDC data shows government labs processed 352 COVID-19 tests — an average of only a dozen per day.

“You cannot fight a fire blindfolded,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, said at a recent briefing. “We cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected.”

The Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the CDC, has begun an internal review to assess its own mistakes. But outside observers and federal health officials have pointed to four primary issues that together hampered the national response — the early decision not to use the test adopted by the World Health Organization, flaws with the more complex test developed by the CDC, government guidelines restricting who could be tested and delays in engaging the private sector to ramp up testing capacity.

Combined with messaging from the White House minimizing the disease, that fueled a lackluster response that missed chances to slow the spread of the virus, they said.

“There were many, many opportunities not to end up where we are,” Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the director of the Global Health Institute at Harvard, told the AP. “Basically, they took this as business as usual. … And that’s because the messaging from the White House was ‘this is not a big deal, this is no worse than the flu.’ So that message basically created no sense of urgency within the FDA or the CDC to fix it.”

Even as private labs have been cleared by government regulators to process tens of thousands of additional tests in the last two weeks, experts warn that the nation is still falling well short of enough testing capacity to keep ahead of the highly contagious virus. And it can often take a week just to get results back.

Trump last week rated his administration’s response to the crisis as a perfect 10. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the CDC’s system wasn’t designed to test for and track a widespread outbreak, which he characterized as “a failing.”

In interviews with the AP, two federal health officials with direct knowledge of the situation said CDC experts don’t know why many of the agency’s test kits failed to reliably detect the virus. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about what went wrong.

J. Stephen Morrison, a health policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, called the testing issues a “debacle,” contributing to what he described as a confused and delayed federal response to the crisis.

As a result, he said, the CDC has now been marginalized within the White House — a worrisome development.

“CDC has generally been regarded as the best in the game,” Morrison said. “I don’t think they anticipated the technical difficulty, or the speed with which the virus has been moving. The virus was racing out ahead of them.”

FATEFUL DECISIONS

On New Year’s Eve, Chinese scientists informed the World Health Organization about a cluster of 27 pneumonia cases of unknown cause in the industrial megalopolis of Wuhan that they linked to the city’s wholesale fish market. Less than two weeks later, the Chinese had sequenced the virus’ genetic makeup and shared it with the world.

Within days, German scientists had developed a test that could identify a unique part of the virus’ DNA. The WHO quickly adopted the German test, publishing technical guidelines on Jan. 17 and working with private companies to produce testing kits.

As they have done with some past outbreaks, officials at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta decided to develop their own test, focusing on three gene targets distinct from what the WHO used. Over the decades, the headquarters lab had built a track record of being among the first to develop tests for new diseases and quickly making them available for disease tracking.

The CDC published the technical details for its COVID-19 test on Jan. 28, 10 days after the WHO. By then, the virus had already been in the U.S. for at least two weeks.

The 35-year-old man who would become the first American to test positive had arrived in Seattle on Jan. 15, following a trip to Wuhan. After swabs from his nose and throat were flown to the CDC lab, federal officials announced the results Jan. 21.

In an interview on CNBC the following day, the president was asked about the risk to the nation.

“We have it totally under control,” he said. “It’s one person coming in from China. … It’s going to be just fine.”

With limited capacity at the CDC lab in Atlanta, the agency placed strict criteria on who could be tested: people with fevers, coughing or difficulty breathing who had also visited Wuhan within the preceding two weeks or who had close contact with someone already confirmed or under investigation for having the virus.

On Jan. 30, the day WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency, Trump again assured the American people that the virus was “very well under control.”

Then he departed for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where he tweeted a photo of himself playing golf at his club in West Palm Beach.

“Getting a little exercise this morning!” the president wrote.

The following day, the U.S. declared its own emergency. Still, U.S. citizens returning from China who did not have a fever weren’t tested for the virus but were encouraged to self-quarantine at home for 14 days.

At that point, the CDC had confirmed just eight cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. The agency amended its testing criteria to include people with fevers who had traveled to China, rather than specifically just Wuhan.

___

FLAWED TEST KITS

Four days after the U.S. declared a state of emergency, only 178 patients had been tested and 82 others were listed as “pending,” meaning they were awaiting final results, according to CDC data released at the time.

To help increase the number of people being screened, the Food and Drug Administration issued emergency authorization for CDC-certified labs run by state health departments to begin processing swabs, and they were provided with kits that could test 250 patients.

As the first tests were processed at the state labs, technicians reported getting inconclusive results, which the CDC has said could be due to the test looking for signs of generic coronaviruses, of which there are many, rather than the specific virus that causes COVID-19.

Whatever the reason, by mid-February, only about a half-dozen state and local public health labs had reliable tests. But still, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield continued to insist his agency had developed “a very accurate test.”

“We found that, in some of the states, it didn’t work,” Redfield said earlier this month. “We figured out why. I don’t consider that a fault. I consider that doing quality control. I consider that success.”

The testing problems emerged just as the CDC broadened its criteria to include patients who were “severely ill” with COVID-19 symptoms “even if a known source of exposure has not been identified.”

As more sick people sought to be tested, many states were forced to limit access because of the flawed CDC test. Accounts began to emerge through social media of people with all the symptoms of COVID-19 who either couldn’t get tested or had test results delayed by days or even a week.

“I know of doctor friends of mine who have critically ill patients in the ICU, and we don’t know if they have COVID or not because we can’t get a test,” Jha said last week.

__

COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION

On Feb. 24, exasperated officials at the Association of Public Health Laboratories sent a letter to the FDA, basically asking permission for state labs to develop their own tests. Within days, the FDA reversed its previous position and said both public and private labs could conduct testing.

Trump, for his part, continued to insist the virus would die out on its own. “One day, it’s like a miracle. It will disappear,” he predicted Feb. 27.

By then, experts say, the opportunity to halt the relentless spread of the virus within the U.S. population had been lost.

On Feb. 29, only 472 patients had been tested nationwide, with just 22 cases confirmed, according to CDC data. Of those, nine cases were not related to travel but had spread person-to-person within the U.S.

By comparison, South Korea had its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on Jan. 20, the same day as the U.S. Officials there used a test that focused on the same gene targets as the WHO test, according to the website of a test manufacturer. They then quickly permitted private-sector labs to run the samples. As a result, a nation with less than one-sixth the population of the U.S. mobilized to test more than 20,000 people a day.

South Korea also instituted drive-thru centers, allowing quicker identification of those who were infected but might not be displaying symptoms, thus slowing the emergence of new cases to a more manageable level.

Meanwhile, the rate of U.S. infections soared.

“The system is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for,” Fauci conceded during a congressional hearing earlier this month. “That is a failing. Let’s admit it.”

SHIFTING BLAME

As public outrage over the lack of available U.S. tests grew, the FDA announced it would allow private diagnostic lab companies to produce new tests without preauthorization from regulators.

Trump and HHS Secretary Alex Azar visited the CDC lab in Atlanta on March 6, praising the agency’s performance and promising 4 million test kits would be available by the end of the following week.

That lofty number didn’t match the ability of U.S. labs to process tests, however. Private providers were just then ramping up, while CDC and state health labs processed about 25,200 COVID-19 tests in the following seven days, according to CDC data.

At the same news conference, Trump said he wanted infected passengers to remain on a cruise ship off the West Coast to keep the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. low.

“I like the numbers being where they are,” Trump said, shortly before departing Atlanta for another weekend of golf in Florida. “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.”

Trump has also attempted to mislay blame for the testing troubles on the Obama administration. In 2018, Trump disbanded the White House directorate charged with preparing for and responding to global pandemics.

“I don’t take responsibility at all,” Trump replied when asked about the testing shortfall in a March 13 briefing at the White House.

Morrison said Trump appears to see the virus as a political issue rather than a public health threat.

“You can imagine a White House that said, ‘Do whatever it takes to test everybody for the virus,’” he said. “That wasn’t the mentality. It was the opposite mentality, and ultimately the responsibility to protect the American people lies with the White House.”

Trump and other officials have falsely said they declined to use the WHO test because it isn’t reliable.

“Quality testing for our American people is paramount to us,” Deborah Birx, who is coordinating the U.S. coronavirus response, said last week. “It doesn’t help to put out a test where 50% or 47% are false positives.”

“It was a bad test,” Trump chimed in.

Tarik Jašarević, a WHO spokesperson, told the AP last week that his agency had so far shipped 1.5 million testing kits manufactured in Germany to 120 countries around the globe, with no such problems emerging.

“The test has been validated in three external laboratories, adapted by WHO and manufactured in line with international quality standards,” he said. “It has shown consistently good performance in laboratory and clinical use, and neither a significant number of false-positive nor false-negative results have been reported.”

Over the past two weeks, U.S. testing capacity has surged, with private companies joining in. LabCorp began providing tests March 5, and Quest Diagnostics followed four days later. Tests also are being conducted at individual hospitals and other centers.

With the increased testing has come a skyrocketing number of confirmed cases, zooming from 43 at the beginning of March to 33,404 by Monday.

Only in the last few days has the United States finally begun testing more people each day than far smaller South Korea, according to data complied by Johns Hopkins University.

Jha estimates the U.S. should be testing 100,000 to 150,000 people per day — figures he said should be obtainable given the number of high-quality diagnostic labs in the country.

“We certainly have the capacity. It’s just we’re not doing it,” Jha said Thursday. “We are up to about 40,000 tests per day now — and so we are moving in the right direction. Still far from where we need to be, but moving.”"

The Health and Human Services inspector general’s office said it’s seeing marketing schemes rapidly pivot to offering tests for COVID-19 and “Senior Care Packages” with hand sanitizer or even tout a vaccine, which doesn’t exist. Some marketers falsely claim that President Donald Trump has ordered that seniors get tested.

It’s all a trick to get personal information that can be used to bill federal and state health programs, said Christian Schrank, assistant inspector general for investigations.

“It’s a straight-up ruse to get your Medicare number or your Social Security number under the guise of having a test kit or a sanitary kit sent to you,” Schrank said. Often the caller will hang up as soon as that number is provided.

Low-income Medicaid recipients also are being targeted.

The sales pitches are coming via telemarketing calls, robocalls, social media posts, emails and door-to-door visits, Schrank explained.

As legitimate businesses close their doors and send workers home to comply with social distancing measures, fraud operators have ramped up recruiting for their call centers, Schrank said.

For seniors, the consequences can be long term. Health care fraud is one of the most prevalent forms of identity theft.

Once a person’s Medicare information is in the hands of fraudsters, it can be used repeatedly to bill for unwanted goods and services. That can create problems if a Medicare enrollee ever does need them.

Among the schemes reported to authorities:

— In Florida, seniors have been contacted by fraudsters claiming that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have mandated they get tested and that their Medicare number is required.

— A scheme in the Midwest offers a “Senior Care Package” that includes hand sanitizer. “As we know, it’s very difficult for beneficiaries to get out to the store,” Schrank said. “At this time when seniors are searching for answers, these individuals are preying on their desire to speak with somebody.”

— Several online operations are offering coronavirus vaccines, when none has been developed and approved. “The first time you hear about a vaccine, it’s not going to be through an email or a telemarketing call,” Schrank said.

Federal and state law enforcement officials have set up a working group to share information on the quickly evolving scams and route leads to the agencies best equipped to investigate. The phone number for the HHS inspector general’s hotline is 800-HHS-TIPS, and the National Center for Disaster Fraud hotline is at 866-720-5721.

For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Worldwide, about 350,000 cases have been reported, and while most people recover in weeks, more than 15,000 have died.

Fraud against government health care programs is a pervasive problem that costs taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year. The true extent is unknown.

Officials advise seniors who get fraudulent calls to just hang up the phone."
https://www.snopes.com/,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/03/23/fed-to-buy-unlimited-government-debt-lend-to-businesses/,2020-03-23T00:00:00,"Fed to Buy Unlimited Government Debt, Lend to Businesses","WASHINGTON (AP) — In its boldest effort to protect the U.S. economy from the coronavirus, the Federal Reserve says it will buy as much government debt as it deems necessary and will also begin lending to small and large businesses and local governments to help them weather the crisis.

The Fed’s announcement Monday removes any dollar limits from its plans to support the flow of credit through an economy that has been ravaged by the viral outbreak. The central bank’s all-out effort has now gone beyond even the extraordinary drive it made to rescue the economy from the 2008 financial crisis.

“The coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world,” the Fed said in a statement. “Our nation’s first priority is to care for those afflicted and to limit the further spread of the virus. While great uncertainty remains, it has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions. Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.”

Financial markets sharply reversed themselves after the announcement but then fell back again after the market opened. By mid-morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 1.5%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell, a sign that more investors are willing to purchase the securities.

In unleashing its aggressive new efforts, the Fed is trying both to stabilize the economic standstill and allay panic in financial markets. Many corporations and city and state governments are in desperate need of loans to pay bills and maintain operations as their revenue from customers or taxpayers collapses. That need has escalated demand for cash. In the meantime, large businesses have been drawing, as much as they can, on their existing borrowing relationships with banks.

The intensifying needs for cash means that banks and other investors are seeking to rapidly unload Treasuries, short-term corporate debt, municipal bonds and other securities. The Fed’s move to step in and act as a buyer of last resort is intended to provide that needed cash.

The Fed’s actions increase pressure on Congress to approve a nearly $2 trillion stimulus package that stalled late Sunday. The bill includes funds that would help backstop the Fed’s lending. Many economists say that whatever financial support Congress eventually provides will likely be even more important than the Fed’s intervention. And they warn that such fiscal help needs to come soon.

The Fed’s intervention is not a substitute for fiscal stimulus,” said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist who is now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “Let’s hope Congress passes something quickly.’’

Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a tax and advisory firm, said that if Congress can pass the legislation and have it signed into law by Tuesday, banks could start making loans to small and medium-sized businesses, with the Fed’s support, by Friday.

“It is dependent on the political authorities getting their ducks in a row and passing a bill,” he said.

In its announcement Monday, the Fed said it will establish three new lending facilities that will provide up to $300 billion by purchasing corporate bonds, a wider range of municipal bonds and securities tied to such debt as auto and real estate loans. It will also buy an unlimited amount of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to try to hold down borrowing rates and ensure those markets function smoothly.

The central bank’s new go-for-broke approach is an acknowledgment that its previous plans to keep credit flowing smoothly, which included dollar limits, wouldn’t be enough in the face of the viral outbreak, which has brought the U.S. economy to a near-standstill as workers and consumers stay home. Last week, it said it would buy $500 billion of Treasuries and $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities, then quickly ran through roughly half those amounts by week’s end.

And on Monday, the New York Federal Reserve said it would buy $75 billion of Treasuries and $50 billion of mortgage-backed securities each day this week.

“They’re really setting the economy up’’ to start functioning again when the health crisis subsides, said Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice chair who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “Part of this is about the other side of the valley: Make sure the credit is there.’’

Still, Kohn noted, “These things will take some time to set up. These are complicated’’ programs.

Just knowing that the Fed is on the case should reassure businesses as the programs ramp up, Kohn said.

“The fact that this is coming: People will know it,’’ Kohn said. “They know the Fed is on the job. If there are issues that come up, what you’re seeing from this Federal Reserve is: ‘We will deal with it.’ ’’

The Fed mostly creates the money it will use to buy bonds and lend to large and small businesses. But it seeks to avoid credit losses. It has been using money from a Treasury fund to offset any losses on its loans. That fund, the Exchange Stabilization Fund, has already committed most of that money to the Fed’s existing facilities. The congressional legislation could boost that amount by $500 billion.

“The steps announced today, combined with the previous ones … should substantially improve market functioning and should provide some important support for the economy,” said Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist who is now head of global policy research at Cornerstone Macro.

But Perli cautioned that the benefits won’t be felt immediately.

“The next couple of quarters will still be probably bad,” he said.

The new programs announced Monday by the Fed include two that will buy corporate debt issued by large companies. The Fed legally can’t lend directly to companies. But it can lend to separate entities, which can then make those purchases.

One program will buy newly issued corporate debt. This is an effort to revive that market, which has effectively come to a standstill. The second will buy previously issued corporate debt. Both programs will include $10 billion provided by the Treasury to offset any losses.

A third new lending program will buy securities backed by packages of auto loans, credit card loans and some small business loans. Lending in those areas hinges on the ability of banks to package those loans into securities and sell them. So the Fed’s move is critical to the ability of banks to continue to provide these loans as the economy falters.

The Treasury will also provide $10 billion to that program to offset any losses. All told, those three programs can lend up to $300 billion.

The Fed said that companies “that are expected to receive direct financial assistance under pending federal legislation” are not eligible to participate in the corporate lending programs — a reference to the airline industry and perhaps others under consideration.

Companies will have to be rated at investment grade, or above junk level, to be eligible for lending. The companies can defer payments for up to six months, the Fed said. If they do suspend payment, they are not allowed to buy back their shares or pay dividends, it said.

The Fed also said it will soon establish a “Main Street Business Lending Program” to support lending to small and medium-sized businesses. But it provided few details and didn’t say when that program would begin.

That program will likely be funded by and is intended to complement the congressional stimulus legislation, which also includes a provision to provide financing to very small companies. The Fed’s Main Street program will target medium-sized businesses, officials said.

Brusuelas noted that by announcing the Main Street lending program, the Fed had committed to something before a congressional backstop was in place, a virtually unheard-of step.

“You’re never going to see that again, hopefully,” he said."

The nation’s top infectious disease expert tells Science magazine in an interview that Trump listens “even though we disagree on some things.”

“He goes his own way. He has his own style,” Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in the telephone interview with the magazine on Sunday. “But on substantive issues, he does listen to what I say.”

Trump complained at a recent briefing that China should have told the world about the virus much earlier. The new coronavirus originated in China. Fauci says he told the “appropriate people” after Trump made the comment that “it doesn’t comport, because two or three months earlier would have been September.”

Fauci said that Trump’s aides may caution him against repeating the statement but that if the president chooses to say it again, “I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down.”

Trump and Fauci sparred politely but publicly last week over whether a malaria drug would work to treat people with the coronavirus disease.

Asked about being present when things are said that he disagrees with, Fauci said: “I don’t disagree in the substance. It is expressed in a way that I would not express it, because it could lead to some misunderstanding about what the facts are about a given subject.”

Twitter notices when Fauci isn’t present for the briefings.

On Friday, the doctor put a hand over his face when Trump injected a conspiracy theory into the proceeding by referring to the State Department as the “Deep State Department.”

Fauci’s brief hand movement and facial expression became an internet meme.

Asked if he’d been criticized for it, Fauci said “no comment.”"

“I didn’t expect to be starting off my week with such a dire message for America,” Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on “CBS This Morning,” as he warned the numbers will grow get worse this week. “Things are going to get worse before they get better. We really need everyone to understand this…and lean into what they can do to flatten the curve.”

Only hours before the surgeon general’s dire warning, Trump suggested in a tweet that the remedies may be more harmful than the outbreak in a tweet that contradicted the advice of medical experts across the nation.

“WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,” he wrote, adding: “AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!”

Trump officials and congressional leaders, meanwhile, were to resume talks at 9 a.m. after working through the night on the massive $2 trillion economic rescue plan. Democrats had derailed the plan Sunday night, arguing it was tilted toward corporations and did too little to help workers and health care providers.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin exited the Capitol just before midnight, struck an optimistic note: “We’re very close,” he said, adding negotiators would work through the night.

“Our nation cannot afford a game of chicken,” warned Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., his voice rising on the Senate floor Sunday night. His goal is to vote Monday. The Senate will re-convene at noon.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, also sounded an optimistic note.

“This bill is going to affect this country and the lives of Americans, not just for the next few days, but in the next few months and years — so we have to make sure it is good, he said. ‘”There were some serious problems with the bill leader McConnell laid down. Huge amounts of corporate bailout funds without restrictions or without oversight — you wouldn’t even know who is getting the money. Not enough money for hospitals, nurses, PPE, masks, all the health care needs. No money for state and local government, many of whom would go broke. Many other things.”

But Schumer said they were making progress in dealing with those issues. “We’re getting closer and closer. And I’m very hopeful, is how I’d put it, that we can get a bill in the morning.”

On the economic front, the Federal Reserve announced Monday it will lend to small and large businesses and local governments as well as extend its bond buying programs as part of a series of sweeping steps to support the flow of credit through an economy ravaged by the viral outbreak.

The Fed said it will set up three new lending facilities that will provide up to $300 billion by purchasing corporate bonds, buying a wider range of municipal bonds, and purchasing asset-backed securities.

It also says it will buy an unlimited amount of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in an effort hold down interest rates and ensure those markets function smoothly.

With a population on edge and shell-shocked financial markets poised for the new work week, Washington labored under the size and scope of the rescue package that’s more ambitious than any in recent times — larger than the 2008 bank bailout and 2009 recovery act combined.

Democrats say the largely GOP-led effort did not go far enough to provide health care and worker aid and fails to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion “slush fund” for corporations. They voted to block its advance.

Democrats won a concession — to provide four months of expanded unemployment benefits, rather than just three as proposed, according to an official granted anonymity to discuss the private talks. The jobless pay also extends to self-employed and so-called gig workers.

Alarms were being sounded from coast to coast about the wave of coronavirus cases about to crash onto the nation’s health system.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had dire, urgent news from the pandemic’s U.S. epicenter: “April and May are going to be a lot worse,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He all but begged Washington to help procure ventilators and other medical supplies and accused the Republican president of “not lifting a finger” to help.

Trump urged Congress to get a deal done and, during the Sunday briefing, responded to criticism that his administration was sluggish to act. He cited his cooperation with the three states hardest hit — New York, Washington and California — and invoked a measure to give governors flexibility in calling up the national guard under their control, while the federal government covers the bill.

But even as Trump stressed federal-local partnerships, some governors, including Republican Greg Abbott of Texas, expressed unhappiness with Washington’s response. The president himself took a swipe hours earlier at Gov. J. B. Pritzker, D-Ill., saying that he and “a very small group of certain other Governors, together with Fake News” should not be “blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings.”

In recent days, Trump invoked the Defense Protection Act, a rarely used, decades-old authority that can be used to compel the private sector to manufacture needed medical supplies like masks and ventilators. Officials said Sunday that it would be used voluntarily and businesses would not be compelled to act.

“We are a country not based on nationalizing our business,” said Trump, who has repeatedly railed against socialism overseas and among Democrats.

Two days after he lashed out at a reporter who asked about his message to frightened Americans, Trump said, “For those worried and afraid, please know as long as I am your president, you can feel confident that you have a leader who will always fight for you.”

The urgency to act is mounting, as jobless claims skyrocket and fnancial markets are eager for signs that Washington can soften the blow of the healthcare crisis and what experts say is a looming recession. Stock futures declined sharply as Trump spoke Sunday evening.

Officials late Sunday put the price tag of the ballooning rescue package at nearly $2 trillion. That does not include additional measures being taken by the Federal Reserve to shore up the economy.

Central to the package is as much as $350 billion for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. There is also a one-time rebate check of about $1,200 per person, or $3,000 for a family of four, as well as the extended unemployment benefits.

Hospitals, Mnuchin said, will get approximately $110 billion for the expected influx of sick patients.

The treasury secretary said a significant part of the package will involve working with the Federal Reserve for up to $4 trillion of liquidity to support the economy with “broad-based lending programs.”

But Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have pushed for add-ons, including food security aid, small business loans and other measures for workers.

They warned the draft plan’s $500 billion for corporations does not put enough restraints on business, saying the ban on corporate stock buy-backs is weak and the limits on executive pay are only for two years.

“We’re not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the Treasury Department to be able to hand out to their friends,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. “We’re here to help workers, we’re here to help hospitals.”

The president, when pressed by a reporter, dodged a question as to whether his own business would seek federal funds.

With Sunday’s failed vote, McConnell angrily blamed Pelosi, who returned to Washington for a top-level meeting, saying she “poured cold water” over the draft plan. But any measure from the Senate also needs to pass the House.

The details are coming from drafts of both bills circulating among lobbyists but not yet released to the public. They were obtained by The Associated Press.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mildf or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover."
https://www.snopes.com/,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/03/23/india-halts-its-crucial-train-network-to-try-to-stop-coronavirus/,2020-03-23T00:00:00,India Halts Its Crucial Train Network to Try to Stop Coronavirus,"NEW DELHI (AP) — As India expanded its virus-containment measures and halted its train network, the country’s lifeblood, the federal government warned Monday of strict legal action for those who flout the rules.

“Please save yourself, save your family,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted in Hindi, calling for states to follow the preventive measures issued by the federal government to contain the spread of the virus.

The strict legal action vowed wasn’t immediately clear. Other places have simply sent violators home, since alternatives like detention would create crowded conditions where the virus could spread.

To contain the outbreak, authorities have gradually started to lock down many of the country of 1.3 billion people, sending stock markets to record lows. Parliament adjourned its session, and India’s civil aviation authority banned all commercial flights within India starting Wednesday. International flights were kept from landing from Sunday until at least March 31.

At least 80 districts where cases of infection have been detected are under stringent lockdown. Police and health care were operating, but commercial establishments have closed except for essential services. Banks have asked their customers to switch to online transactions and reduced their office staff.

The government has fervently appealed for people to practice social distancing and wash their hands often.

But Modi’s call for a 14-hour voluntary curfew on Sunday was the first nationwide effort at social isolation practices the World Health Organization believes are critical to slowing the outbreak to a level that doesn’t overwhelm health care systems. Lockdowns in other places have lasted at least two weeks, which is believed to be the maximum incubation period of the virus.

Streets across India’s cities on Sunday were deserted as citizens stayed indoors heeding Modi’s call. But key train stations were packed with thousands of migrant workers suddenly out of work and trying to head to their villages, risking carrying the infection to the nation’s vast hinterland.

Late Sunday, train services were suspended until March 31 while crowds were still waiting to board. The suspension included major long-distance trains and public transit in India’s big cities, exempting only freight. The New Delhi Railway Station, usually teeming with activity, was empty on Monday.

India’s national railway system totals 67,000 kilometers (42,000 miles) and carries more than 8 billion passengers a year.

India has at least 415 active cases of infection with the new coronavirus and seven deaths from COVID-19, the illness it causes.

Many were linked to foreign travel, but indigenous spread of the disease is considered inevitable in India, where tens of millions live in dense urban areas with irregular access to clean water.

Experts have said the number of confirmed cases seemed low for the world’s second-most populous country, amid concerns that India is not testing enough people. The bulk of the testing had been aimed at international travelers and their contacts, but in recent days the government has expanded it to people in hospitals with respiratory symptoms such as pneumonia.

“Our biggest challenge is how do we break this chain of transmission,” Lav Agarwal, a senior health ministry official, said at a briefing in New Delhi on Sunday."

This became clear after the IOC on Sunday announced it was considering a postponement and would make a final decision within four weeks. Major Olympic nations like Canada and Australia have added pressure by saying they will not send teams if the games are staged this year.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach sent a letter to athletes explaining the decision, while also acknowledging the extended timeline might not be popular.

“I know that this unprecedented situation leaves many of your questions open,” he wrote. “I also know that this rational approach may not be in line with the emotions many of you have to go through.”

The IOC’s move seemed inevitable for weeks with pressure mounting from all quarters — athletes, sponsors, broadcasters and more than 200 national Olympic committees, and international sports federations.

Shortly after Bach’s statement, the Canadian Olympic Committee said it would not send athletes to the Olympics unless the games are postponed by a year. Australia issued a statement saying it was advising its athletes to prepare for an Olympics in 2021.

World Athletics President Seb Coe sent a letter to Bach saying that holding the Olympics in July “is neither feasible nor desirable.” He outlined a number of reasons, including competitive fairness, the likelihood athletes would overtrain if given a compressed schedule and the uncertainty caused by orders in many countries barring people from gyms and other workout venues.

National Olympic committees in Brazil and Slovenia had also called for postponement until 2021. Norway’s Olympic body said it did not want athletes going to Tokyo until the global health crisis is under control.

The United States governing bodies of swimming and track — two of the three top-tier Summer Games sports — had called on their national Olympic officials to push for a postponement.

Japan’s politicians fell in line quickly on Monday as they awakened to Bach’s move, which was announced at 3 a.m. in Tokyo as most of the city slept.

Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking at a parliamentary session, said a postponement of the Tokyo Olympics would be necessary if the games cannot be held in a complete way because of the coronavirus pandemic.

“If it is difficult to hold (the Games) in a complete way, a decision of postponement would be unavoidable,” he said.

Abe said he hoped the IOC would announce a decision quickly, and Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike echoed him.

The IOC holds most of the cards in any rescheduling, spelled out in a Host City Contract signed in 2013 between the IOC, the Japanese Olympic Committee and the city of Tokyo.

Japan is officially spending $12.6 billion to organize the Olympics, but a national audit put the figure at more than twice that much. The bill is sure to increase with any postponement, and the vast majority of the spending if from the public treasury.

The IOC has a reserve fund of about $2 billion to tide itself over, and also has insurance against postponement or cancellation.

Yoshiro Mori, the president of the organizing committee, said he talked with Bach by teleconference about the delay and was joined by CEO Toshiro Muto.

“Honestly speaking, four weeks is quite a short time to consider all the necessary elements.” Mori said at a Monday news conference. “It requires a tremendous amount of time and we have to hurry to go through this.”

Both were asked about added cost, and who would pay. And both shied away from a direct response.

Mori said cost calculations had to be made, and the availability of venues — presumably for next summer in the northern hemisphere — had to be examined. A decision also has to be made about who pays for the maintenance of venues if the Olympics are postponed.

Similar questions will be asked about the massive Olympic Village, which is to house 11,000 Olympians and 4,400 Paralympians before the high-priced units around Tokyo Bay are sold off by private developers.

“I respect Mr. Bach,” Mori said. “And we trust Mr. Bach. We have been always together walking side by side. I consider Mr. Bach as my best friend.”

The 82-year-old Mori, a former prime minister who has been undergoing treatment for an undisclosed illness, was asked if he could endure more work on the Olympics.

He called it a “rude” question. “I’ve got about two years left to live,” he replied, half smiling as he said it.

The Olympic torch arrived last Friday in northern Japan from Greece. The torch relay it set to begin on Thursday from Fukushima prefecture, the area devastated by the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and the meltdown of three nuclear reactors. Organizers said the relay is still on, but said plans could change very quickly.

On Sunday, thousands crowded the northern city of Sendai to view the flame, which forced organizers the restrict the entry for viewing.

Jeff Kingston, who studies Japanese politics at Temple University in Tokyo, said postponed Olympics will be a minor worry for most people.

“The public is expecting and supports postponement, so it won’t be a big deal,” Kingston said in an email to Associated Press. “People are way more worried about the economic consequences and their jobs and if the number of cases ramps up.”

A recent poll by the Japanese news agency Kyodo said 69/9% did not expect the Olympics to open on schedule.

As of Sunday, Japan had 1,719 confirmed cases of the virus, including 712 from a cruise ship, with 43 deaths.

Former IOC marketing director Michael Payne said the delay might work to the advantage of the IOC and Japan.

“What better platform is there going to be than the Olympic Games when the world has pulled through the virus,” Payne told AP in an interview Sunday, just before the IOC announcement. “You’ve got a dynamic that will be even more powerful for Japan and the rest of the world. But you are going to have a tough road getting there.”"

The latest correspondence came as Kim observed the firing of tactical guided weapons over the weekend, drawing criticism from South Korea, as nuclear talks remain deadlocked.

In a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, Kim’s sister and senior ruling party official, Kim Yo Jong, praised Trump for sending the letter at a time when “big difficulties and challenges lie ahead in the way of developing ties” between the countries.

In the letter, she said Trump explained his plan to “propel the relations between the two countries … and expressed his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work,” an apparent reference to the global coronavirus outbreak. She said her brother expressed his gratitude for Trump’s letter.

North Korea has repeatedly said there hasn’t been a single case of the coronavirus on its soil. Some foreign experts question that claim and say an outbreak in the North could cause a humanitarian disaster because of its poor medical infrastructure. Last month, the State Department expressed concerns about North Korea’s vulnerability to a potential coronavirus outbreak and said it was ready to support efforts by aid organizations to contain the spread of the illness in the North.

A senior Trump administration official said Sunday that Trump sent a letter to Kim that the official said was consistent with Trump’s efforts to engage global leaders during the pandemic. The official said Trump looks forward to continued communications with the North Korean leader.

Kim Yo Jong said Trump’s letter is “a good example showing the special and firm personal relations” between the North Korean and U.S. leaders. But she said it’s not a good idea to “make hasty conclusion or be optimistic about” the prospect for bilateral relations.

“In my personal opinion, I think that the bilateral relations and dialogue for them would be thinkable only when the equilibrium is kept dynamically and morally and justice ensured between the two countries,” she said. “Even at this moment we are working hard to develop and defend ourselves on our own under the cruel environment which the U.S. is keen to ‘provide.’”

Earlier, Trump sent birthday greetings to Kim Jong Un, who was believed to have turned 36 on Jan. 8. Senior North Korean official Kim Kye Gwan said at the time that the birthday message won’t lead his country to return to talks unless the U.S. accepts its demands.

Kim and Trump have met three times and exchanged letters and envoys on many occasions since 2018, when they launched talks on the fate of Kim’s advancing nuclear arsenal. The two leaders have avoided harsh language against each other, and Trump once said he and Kim “fell in love.”

But their diplomacy has largely come to a standstill since the breakdown of their second summit in Vietnam in February 2019, when Trump rejected Kim’s demands for broad sanctions relief in return for a partial disarmament step.

Kim pressed Trump to come up with new proposals to salvage the negotiations by the end of last year. Kim later vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent and unveil “a new strategic weapon,” and warned that he would no longer be bound by a major weapons test moratorium.

In recent weeks, North Korea has fired a slew of artillery and other rockets into the sea in what experts say is an attempt to improve its military capabilities. The weapons were all short range and did not pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland. A resumption of long-range missile or nuclear weapons tests by Kim would likely completely scuttle diplomacy with Trump, experts say.

KCNA said Kim watched the test firing of tactical guided weapons on Saturday with Kim Yo Jong and other top officials. South Korea’s military called the demonstration “very inappropriate” at a time when the world is struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.

South Korea’s military said Saturday that it detected two presumed short-range ballistic missiles that flew from a site in western North Korea across the country and landed in the waters off the east coast. The weapons flew 410 kilometers (255 miles), according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff."
https://www.snopes.com/,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/03/22/rand-paul-is-1st-senator-to-report-positive-test-for-virus/,2020-03-22T00:00:00,Rand Paul Is 1st Senator to Report Positive Test for Virus,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said that he had tested positive for the disease caused by the new coronavirus, becoming the first member of the Senate to report a case of COVID-19. He said in a tweet that he was feeling fine and was in quarantine.

Paul, a doctor, said he has not had symptoms and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He said he was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.

Paul, a deficit hawk, was among eight Senate Republicans who voted against a House-passed bill last week that provided more than $100 billion to boost testing for the coronavirus and guarantee paid sick leave for millions of workers. He also was only Republican senator who opposed an earlier bill authorizing $8.3 billion for initial response to the coronavirus.

The senator was on Capitol Hill on Wednesday afternoon, which was the last time the Senate held floor votes, including on one of his amendments. While Senate Republicans have lunched together as a group most days since, it is unclear if Paul was among them.

South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking Republican senator, said on the Senate floor Sunday that lawmakers will consult with the attending physician at the Capitol about those senators who have been in contact with Paul.

Two House members, Reps. Mario Diaz Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah,, have tested positive.

The Senate was in session Sunday seeking a bipartisan response to the pandemic. If approved, the bill would be the third measure Congress has approved in response to the coronavirus this month.

The White House has increasingly emphasized that testing should prioritize the elderly and health care workers who have symptoms of the virus. While most cases of COVID-19 are mild and tens of thousands of people have recovered, older people and those with underlying health problems are at higher risk for more serious problems, such as pneumonia.

“We don’t want everyone to go out and get a test because there’s no reason for it,” President Donald Trump told reporters in a briefing Friday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells people to seek testing if they have certain symptoms of the flu-like illness caused by the coronavirus – fever, cough and trouble breathing – and if they have traveled recently to an outbreak area or have been in close contact with someone who is infected. They should first be tested for the flu and other routine infections.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover."

No, chloroquine effectiveness only anecdotal","But it is no “100% cure.” U.S. health officials stress the evidence is only anecdotal and that much more study is needed.

A French study of 20 COVID-19 patients indicates the drug might help treat the coronavirus.

Along with sheltering in place, social distancing and immunocompromised, you can add this word to the lexicon of COVID-19: chloroquine.

The drug ""could be a game changer"" in the fight against the new coronavirus, President Donald Trump has said, raising hopes as the nation ramped up its lockdown.

This post shared on Facebook went even further. It virtually screams of a miracle antidote, claiming:

""Huge! Results From Breaking Chloroquine Study Show 100% Cure Rate For Patients Infected With The Coronavirus.""

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

There is a new French study that indicates chloroquine might help. But even its authors acknowledged the study is small and the findings are preliminary. And Dr. Anthony Fauci, the most visible U.S. government expert on coronavirus, said evidence for chloroquine is only anecdotal and much more research is needed.

What is chloroquine?

Chloroquine tablets are available in the United States by prescription only, sold under the brand name Aralen, as well as generic.

The medicine is prescribed to prevent or treat malaria; it is often taken by Americans before they travel to countries where malaria occurs.

Another prescription tablet, hydroxychloroquine, sold under the brand name Plaquenil and as a generic, also can be used to prevent malaria, although it is more of an arthritis medicine.

The Facebook post and an article

The claim on Facebook repeated a headline from, and linked to, an article on TeaParty.org from the Gateway Pundit.

The Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, published its article on March 19, 2020, the same day as the Facebook post.

It turns out, the headline goes further than the article does, although the article has its own problems.

The article reported on an interview Fox News talk show host Laura Ingraham did three days earlier with Gregory Rigano about a chloroquine study.

Rigano not what he appears

The article said a study Rigano co-authored found that ""COVID-19 patients who took hydroxy-chloroquine were found free of the disease in six days,"" and that the drug also ""could act as a preventative."" There are several things about this that are inaccurate.

The article said Rigano is co-author of the study. But Rigano tweeted it and is not listed as a co-author.

The article identified Rigano as a doctor, but he is not. Rigano’s website identifies him as a lawyer in Melville, N.Y., whose ""experience includes advancing various pharmaceutical assets through laboratory, animal, formulation, manufacturing, clinical trials (Phase I - III) as well as commercialization.""

Rigano’s website also says he is an adviser to a drug program at the Stanford University School of Medicine. But Stanford denied in a WIRED article that Rigano is an adviser.

Unlike the headline, the article does not state there is a 100% cure for coronavirus.

Study shows some promise for chloroquine

As for the French study itself, it does indicate chloroquine has some promise for treating the coronavirus.

The authors included researchers from universities in France and Vietnam. They reported a few days before the article was published on their study of 20 people in France with COVID-19. They concluded that the use of chloroquine sped up healing, and the effect was reinforced by adding azithromycin, an antibiotic.

Six of the patients were treated with both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. After six days, all six were ""virologically cured.""

But U.S. government experts quickly put the possibilities for chloroquine in perspective.

Early evidence ""anecdotal,"" more research needed

The day after the article was published, Trump and other federal officials held a news conference about the coronavirus. A reporter posed a question about chloroquine to Fauci, who has served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. The question referred to a coronavirus news conference the previous day, when Trump had spoken positively about chloroquine. In his answer, Fauci made reference to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Here was the exchange:

Reporter: ""Dr. Fauci, it was explained yesterday there has been promise with hydroxy-chloroquine, this potential therapy for people who are infected with coronavirus. Is there any evidence to suggest that, as with malaria, it might be used as a prophylaxis against COVID-19?""

Fauci: ""The answer is no. And the evidence that you’re talking about, John, is anecdotal evidence. So, as the commissioner of FDA and the president mentioned yesterday, we’re trying to strike a balance between making something with a potential of an effect to the American people available, at the same time that we do it, under the auspices of a protocol that would give us information to determine if it’s truly safe and truly effective. But the information that you’re referring to specifically is anecdotal. It was not done in a controlled, clinical trial. So, you really can’t make any definitive statement about it.""

The FDA also tempered expectations, saying in a news release is is working closely with other government agencies and academic centers that are studying chloroquine ""to determine whether it can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms, as well as viral shedding, which can help prevent the spread of disease. Studies are underway to determine the efficacy in using chloroquine to treat COVID-19.""

Based upon limited data, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are currently recommended for treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in several countries, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Our ruling

A Facebook post claimed results from a chloroquine study show a ""100% cure rate for patients infected with the coronavirus.""

The French study of the drug on 20 patients with COVID-19 indicates it could help with treatment, but it is no sure cure. U.S. health experts stress the results are preliminary and much more research is needed.

We rate the claim False."

Let’s look at the numbers","The CDC reported that between mid-February and mid-March, 20% of the hospitalizations for coronavirus were for patients age 20-44 and 18% were age 45-54.

Some college students on spring break have ignored the public health warnings to not congregate in large groups, but experts say young people are vulnerable to coronavirus, too.

With plenty of college students congregating for spring break, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., warned on Twitter that coronavirus is not only afflicting the elderly.

""We only have 3 months of information on #Covid_19,"" Rubio tweeted March 19 to his 4 million followers. ""We have created the perception that younger people have nothing to worry about. We now need to stop saying that. In the U.S. 38% of those hospitalized are under 35. In France half of those in the ICU are under 65.""

In the U.S. 38% of those hospitalized are under 35.



In France half of those in the ICU are under 65. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) March 19, 2020

Rubio’s overall point that younger people are vulnerable has merit. But his U.S. number is wrong.

For the record, his numbers on France were correct. The head of France’s national health agency said March 15 that 50% of people in intensive care are under 60 or under age 65. But we wanted to focus on the U.S. numbers.

Experts warn that U.S. hospitalization data is preliminary, which means the numbers could change in the coming weeks as testing becomes more widespread.

Data shows younger people hospitalized, but older groups more frequently

One day before Rubio’s tweet, the CDC reported there were 508 patients known to have been hospitalized as a result of coronavirus. The hospitalizations represented 12% of U.S. cases between Feb. 12 and March 16.

The data did not include an age group breakdown specific to those under 35. What the CDC did report was that 20% of those hospitalized were ages 20-44, and 18% were 45-54. If we add up those two age groups, we get a total of 38%. We asked Rubio’s spokespersons if that was the 38% he was referencing, but we did not get a response.

Major news outlets including the New York Times and NPR used that 38% statistic to point out that younger populations are also vulnerable to coronavirus. That’s an important message amid spring break, as some college students have ignored the recommendations to avoid large gatherings and have poured onto beaches in Florida, leading many counties or cities to close beaches.

The CDC data shows that the elderly have the highest fatality rate.

The March 18 report by the CDC states that the figures are based on preliminary data and include several limitations, including that data on age and outcomes, including hospitalization, were missing for between 9% and 53% of the cases. Also, further follow-up is needed to determine the outcomes among active cases and data on other risk factors, including if patients had underlying health conditions.

""At the current point, the data is too fluid to have confidence in the accuracy of any statement regarding how COVID-19 affects different age groups,"" said Volker Mai, a University of Florida epidemiologist.

However, Mai said, it’s important to clear up any misperception that young people are immune from the disease. Younger populations are at risk of contracting COVID-19, especially young people with underlying conditions.

""Since we are just at the start of the epidemic here, we don’t have enough data to make strong conclusions about age-specific risk of serious illness and/or death in the U.S. yet,"" said Cindy Prins, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, in an email.

The reason, Prins said, is a lack or lag in testing

Our ruling

Rubio tweeted ""in the U.S. 38% of those hospitalized are under 35.""

We could not find any current data that matches Rubio’s tweet. It is possible that he was citing widely reported data that included people up to age 54.

The CDC reported that 20% of the hospitalizations were ages 20-44 and 18% were 45-54. But the data is preliminary, so it’s challenging to draw conclusions at this stage about the ages of people hospitalized.

Rubio’s office didn’t get back to us but we have to wonder if the mistake in his tweet amounted to a simple transcription error.

Rubio does have a point that younger people are vulnerable to coronavirus — it’s not only older people who have been hospitalized. But because the data point is wrong, we rate this statement Mostly False."

U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy, a North Carolina Republican, is one of them.

Murphy is a physician who won the seat in a special election last year after longtime congressman Walter Jones passed away. Murphy has been posting videos on Twitter, wherein he explains the effects of the virus and the federal government’s response.

In a video posted March 16, Murphy stands next to a white board wearing his scrubs.

Most of his tips are on-point. He says cold weather won’t kill the novel coronavirus (true). He says gargling hot water doesn’t kill coronavirus (also true).

But Murphy also says this.

""Sunlight actually can kill the virus. But we have to be cautious about that. It’s good to be out in the sun, but away at a distance from each other,"" Murphy says.

Is that true?

We reached out to Murphy but didn’t receive a response. So we did our own research.

As it turns out, PolitiFact has already reported on a variation of this claim. Sunlight has not been proven to kill the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19.

A common theory

This is one of many unverified claims about the novel coronavirus.

At first, the reasoning might make sense. There is, in fact, some evidence that viruses don’t like heat.

""The droplets that carry viruses do not stay suspended in humid air as long, and the warmer temperatures lead to more rapid virus degradation,"" Elizabeth McGraw, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University, recently told Time Magazine.

But, at this point, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control isn’t sure the sun or heat will affect COVID-19 the same way. CDC physician and researcher Nancy Messionnier said on Feb. 12 that ""it’s premature to assume"" the heat and sunlight will temper the virus. ""We haven’t been through even a single year with this pathogen,"" she told NPR.

Sun exposure can also raise a person’s vitamin D levels, potentially reducing the incidence of acute respiratory infection, Harvard University professor Marc Lipsitch wrote in his recent paper: ""Seasonality of SARS-CoV-2: Will COVID-19 go away on its own in warmer weather?""

But, Lipsitch wrote, ""On the other hand, we found that this effect was unlikely to be a large factor in the variation in influenza incidence between summer and winter.""

Neither the World Health Organization nor the U.S. Centers for Disease Control list sunlight exposure as a method for preventing the coronavirus. In fact, on its ""mythbusters"" webpage, the WHO says COVID-19 can be transmitted in all climates, ""including areas with hot and humid weather.""

Natural UV light not enough

One reason people might believe sunlight can kill the virus is because sunlight contains ultraviolet light. In Rep. Murphy’s video, he stands next to a white board that mentions UV light from the sun.

High-intensity UV light can indeed kill viruses. But natural sunlight doesn’t provide the UV light intensity needed to kill the virus, according to Rachel Graham, assistant professor of epidemiology at the UNG Gillings School of Global Public Health.

""Exposing surfaces to plain sunlight should not be considered sanitation,"" she said, adding: ""I would never ever, ever rely on sunlight to kill coronavirus.""

Graham’s claim about UV light is supported by Sally Bloomfield, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

To kill a virus, temperatures must rise to about 140 degrees fahrenheit, Bloomfield told the BBC.

Our ruling

Murphy said ""sunlight actually can kill the virus."" This claim has not been proven true.

His whiteboard mentioned UV light in sunlight. But experts claim the UV rays in sunlight aren’t intense enough to COVID-19.

We found no conclusive evidence that someone could prevent the virus by exposing themselves to the sun for long periods of time. And we found no evidence that sunlight exposure could help an infected person defeat the virus. We rate this claim False."

That tweet was among several removed by Twitter, a platform Clarke now says he’s leaving.

In a barrage of tweets slamming the coronavirus response, Clarke said he was tired of erring on the side of caution since this is just “the damn flu.”

David A. Clarke, the outspoken former sheriff of Milwaukee County, says he is leaving Twitter. If that’s true, he sure went out with a bang.

Clarke put the nation’s coronavirus response on blast with a barrage of tweets on March 15, 2020, some of which were later removed by Twitter. Among them:

He urged people to ""go out into the streets"" and demand that schools reopen and government stop exerting such ""control over our lives.""

He said the coronavirus is ""an orchestrated attempt to destroy capitalism.""

He insisted — without any evidence — that George Soros, a prominent backer of liberal causes, is ""somewhere involved in this.""

Whew.

There’s plenty of potential Pants on Fire ratings to be had from the Stetson-wearing controversy-magnet, but we’re going to focus on a fourth, since-deleted tweet.

Here’s the full text (minus a few choice words):

""I am tired of all this, ‘We have to err on the side of caution’ (expletive). We have to get back to reasonableness dammit. It’s the damn flu. Stop being afraid and start being sensible. Wash your (expletive) hands! Stop buying toilet paper. Do you (expletive) hear me????""

Clarke stepped down as sheriff in 2017 after 15 years as the county’s top cop, saying he was leaving to take a high-ranking post in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — a job that never materialized. In the time since, Clarke has also lost posts at a pro-President Trump super PAC and as a regular contributor on Fox News.

Now he’s using his free time to make the case everyone is being unreasonable because this is just ""the damn flu.""

Let’s break it down.

How they’re the same

Coronavirus and the flu are both viruses, and experts say they have some shared characteristics:

Risk factors — The groups of people at highest risk are similar, including the elderly.

Spread — Both diseases spread from person to person through respiratory droplets in coughs and sneezes (though it’s possible coronavirus lingers in the air longer after the sick person has left).

Prevention — The expert advice is similar: wash your hands, don’t touch your face, stay away from people who are sick and stay home if you are sick.

Symptoms — Both cause fever, cough, body aches and fatigue, though coronavirus is more likely to cause shortness of breath.

Treatment — Neither virus is treatable with antibiotics (those only work on bacterial infections).

How they’re different

The diseases have some critical differences, most importantly the death rate and lack of a vaccine.

Based on the current numbers, someone with COVID-19 — the disease caused by coronavirus — is 23 to 68 times more likely to die than someone who contracts the flu, based on the latest data from the World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Vaccine — A flu vaccine is available and effective to prevent the flu, or at least reduce its severity. A coronavirus vaccine is not yet available, and likely won’t be for at least a year.

Treatment — There are antiviral medications that address flu symptoms and can even shorten the duration of the illness, but such medications are still being tested for coronavirus.

Death rate — The fatality rate for this year’s flu is estimated by the CDC at between 0.05% and 0.1% in the United States. The coronavirus fatality rate was estimated at 2.3% of those infected by China’s CDC and 3.4% by the World Health Organization (though many expect that to fall to the 1-2% range once we know more about how many people have been infected).

Infections — Coronavirus has, so far, infected far fewer people. There were about 3,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. when Clarke tweeted, compared to an estimated 36 million to 51 million flu illnesses this season.

Knowledge and research — Scientists know much more about the flu, such as details on how it is transmitted, the range of symptoms and treatment. Such details on coronavirus remain a point of debate.

All this to say, the CDC and other health officials have made it clear coronavirus presents a litany of risks the standard flu does not. The overwhelmed health care systems in first China, then Italy reinforced the severity of the disease and the breadth of its potential impact here.

And the reaction of government alone — closing schools, bars, restaurants and more — makes it clear there is a stark difference between the two.

Our rating

Ranting against those who would ""err on the side of caution,"" Clarke claimed coronavirus is just the ""damn flu.""

There is indeed overlap in some basic areas — what symptoms it causes, how it is spread, who is most at risk, etc. But those pale in light of the stark differences.

There is no vaccine for coronavirus. Treatment approaches are not as well established. And most critically, someone who contracts COVID-19 is at least 20 times more likely to die of the disease than someone with the flu, based on the best available data.

The overall theme from Clarke’s tweetstorm was that the coronavirus is no big deal — that the disease is just the same old flu virus with a heaping spoonful of government overreach.

That flies in the face of lots of established science, as well as what nations like China and Italy have already experienced.

We rate Clarke’s claim Pants on Fire."

He didn’t talk that way,"Trump did activate federal measures to contain the spread in late January.

In late February, he said the virus was “very much under control.”

In January, Trump said there were no worries about a pandemic.

In the early days of the coronavirus crisis, President Donald Trump aimed to reassure the public. Now, he has called for a 15-day push to shut down transmission.

""By making shared sacrifices and temporary changes, we can protect the health of our people and we can protect our economy,"" Trump said in a March 17 press conference.

When a reporter asked if there had been a shift in tone, Trump shot back.

""I've always known this is a real, this is a pandemic,"" Trump said. ""I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.""

Trump re-emphasized that point in a tweet the next morning.

""I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the ‘borders’ from China,"" Trump tweeted March 18.

I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the “borders” from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2020

Trump and his administration acted to keep the virus out of the United States, but his words in public downplayed the threat for many weeks.

Moves in Washington and worldwide

On Jan. 20, about three weeks after China first reported the new virus, the World Health Organization reported cases in China, Japan, Thailand and South Korea.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention activated its emergency response center on Jan. 21. On Jan. 29, the White House formed the Coronavirus Task Force, headed by Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and coordinated by the National Security Council.

On Jan. 30, Trump effectively banned all non-Americans from entering the country if they had been in China in the previous two weeks. Americans could come back, but they would be quarantined. Azar declared a public health emergency.

The same day, WHO declared a global health emergency. It was the fifth time WHO issued such a warning since 2005.

Trump aims to reassure

Fears of a pandemic were in the air by mid January. The federal response came as Trump painted a more comforting picture.

On Jan. 22, in an interview with CNBC, Trump was asked, ""Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?""

""No,"" Trump replied. ""Not at all. We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.""

Two days later, he gave the sense that the virus would be kept in China.

""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,"" Trump tweeted Jan. 24. ""The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.""

China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020

Trump maintained that upbeat tone at a Jan. 30 rally in Iowa.

""We think we have it very well under control,"" he said. ""We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five. And those people are all recuperating successfully.""

In a Feb. 2 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump repeated the idea that transmission was unlikely.

""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,"" he said. ""We’re going to see what happens, but we did shut it down.""

Trump also suggested that warmer weather in April would beat back the virus. As late as Feb. 24 and Feb. 25, Trump continued to paint a picture of a virus corralled.

He tweeted that the virus was ""very much under control in the USA,"" and added ""Stock Market starting to look very good to me!""

In India, he said ""we have very few people with it,"" and they were getting better.

This was at a time when WHO had reported 76,000 cases worldwide.

A pandemic is when a new disease spreads worldwide. On March 11, WHO formally declared the coronavirus to be a pandemic.

Our ruling

Trump said that he’s ""always known this is a real, this is a pandemic. I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.""

Until late February, Trump spoke as though the U.S. problem was limited and well under control. That description is at odds with the nature of a pandemic.

We can’t know what was in Trump’s mind when he aimed to reassure the public, but his words did not fit with the threat of a pandemic.

Trump’s claim that he was always aware of it being a pandemic is contradicted by his many early comments. His statement now is not accurate. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

A viral image comparing Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama argues that the coronavirus has infected far fewer Americans than did the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu — but that, due to media coverage, reaction to the coronavirus has been overblown.

Here is the full claim:

""President Trump, COVID-19 coronavirus:

U.S. cases: 1,329

U.S. deaths: 38

panic level: mass hysteria.

""President Obama, H1N1 virus:

U.S. cases: 60.8 million

U.S. deaths: 12,469

panic level: totally chill.

""Do you all see how the media can manipulate your life?""

The post, shared on Facebook on March 13, 2020, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

The numbers — for the coronavirus, as of March 12, 2020; and for the swine flu, from April 2009 to April 2010 — are essentially accurate, based on federal government counts.

The numbers in the post actually show a death rate for COVID-19 at more than 100 times that of H1N1.

In any case, it is misleading to compare the two outbreaks at this point in the coronavirus pandemic.

COVID-19 has been in the United States for only about two months; the swine flu figures are for one year, from April 2009 to 2010.

As we’ve reported, it’s difficult this early in an outbreak for public health experts to estimate death rates for the coronavirus; early estimates often undercount mild cases and fail to take into account the fact that some recently infected patients are going to die in the future.

When we published this fact-check, the latest figures from the World Health Organization, for March 17, 2020, showed a surge in COVID-19 cases in the days since the post — 3,503 cases of COVID-19 in the United States, including 58 deaths.

Indeed, it’s too soon to know precisely how deadly COVID-19 is, several experts said.

""The COVID numbers in no way define the problem. We will know the problem after we do many, many tests,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology, and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina and director of its Institute for Global Health & Infectious Diseases.

""Comparing flu"" generally and COVID-19 ""is simply not a good idea,"" he said. ""For flu, the world has vast experience and vaccines. And treatments. And a well-defined mortality rate far lower than COVID. So, as the world faces a new, very contagious fatal infection, it is not surprising that we all feel anxious.""

Said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine and physiology and biophysics at the University of Southern California: ""The raw numbers make H1N1 look worse, but in reality the risk of death is much higher for COVID-19.""

As for the post’s claim of mass hysteria over coronavirus versus a totally chill response to H1N1, it’s worth noting President Barack Obama’s acting director of health and human services declared H1N1 a public health emergency when the United States had only 20 confirmed cases of H1N1 and no deaths.

Moreover, as FactCheck.org reported, while the H1N1 death toll may sound high, it was far lower than initially expected. It also turned out to have a case fatality rate of just 0.02% — well below even many typical seasonal influenzas.

So, given that indications are the coronavirus death rate is much higher — and given that experts warn the nation’s hospitals are under-prepared to treat the numbers of patients predicted to need care — it makes sense that state and local governments are taking significant action to limit its spread.

Our ruling

The impact in the United States of swine flu might appear much worse than COVID-19, but it lasted for a year, whereas the coronavirus has been here only about two months. And while it’s too soon to calculate how deadly COVID-19 will be, two experts told us it is clearly more deadly than H1N1. This statement contains an element of truth in that the figures quoted were accurate at the time they were posted, but the post ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this Mostly False.

Oscar Health does have ties to the Kushner family through Jared Kushner and more directly through Jared’s brother, Joshua Kushner.

A health care startup linked to the family of Jared Kushner recently launched a website to help Americans assess their symptoms for the novel coronavirus and locate nearby testing centers.

The timing of Oscar Health’s testing locator coincided with President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement of a partnership with Google to build a similar website for the Bay Area.

Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that a rumor circulating on social media claims that Trump ""tapped"" his son-in-law’s company for a testing-related project.

""So Oscar Health, the company tapped by Trump to profit from COVID tests, is a Kushner company,"" the March 15 Facebook post says. ""Imagine that, profits over national safety.""

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

The company does have a Kushner-family connection, and Jared Kushner has played a role in the White House’s coronavirus response efforts. But the Facebook post goes slightly too far in claiming that Trump ""tapped"" Oscar Health to profit from COVID-19 testing.

What’s Jared Kushner’s connection to Oscar Health?

Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, is connected to Oscar Health through his brother Joshua, a co-founder and investor in the health insurance start-up.

Mother Jones reported that a 2013 report from the New York State Department of Financial Services showed Jared Kushner was also a big player in Oscar early on.

The state report showed that, as of 2013, Oscar’s parent corporation was partly owned by Thrive Capital Partners III LP, which in turn was owned by Thrive Partners III GP LLC. The report listed both Jared and Joshua Kushner as owners of Thrive.

""Jared Kushner and Joshua Kushner are deemed the ultimate controlling persons in Oscar’s holding company system,"" the government report said.

Mother Jones also identified a 2018 New York State Department of Financial Services report, which said that as of December 2015, Joshua Kushner was ""the ultimate controlling person.""

Public financial disclosure forms for Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, show that the couple owned and received capital gains from shares of Thrive in 2017 and 2018 but divested from Thrive-associated funds in 2017. Their 2019 disclosures show no earnings from Thrive.

Jared Kushner did seek advice from Joshua Kushner’s father-in-law, a physician, when helping to craft the White House’s coronavirus response, according to the New York Times.

Is Oscar Health making profits from COVID-19 tests?

It’s too soon to tell how much Oscar Health could profit off the coronavirus crisis. As an insurer, the company is not manufacturing or conducting tests, as far as we could tell.

Oscar Health did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But we were able to complete Oscar’s risk assessment free of charge, and the page for locating testing centers said ""the cost of COVID-19 testing for Oscar members at any facility is $0.""

On March 18, Trump signed into law a relief package that makes coronavirus tests — and health care provider visits that result in the ordering of coronavirus tests — free for patients.

It’s possible that Oscar could still charge customers for health services associated with seeking a coronavirus test when a test isn’t ultimately produced, however.

Did Trump ""tap"" Oscar Health to help with testing?

We found no evidence that Trump formally tasked Oscar Health with helping to ramp up testing for the coronavirus, or that the company’s testing website was created at the White House’s request. (The White House declined to comment on the record.)

Business Insider reported that the company agreed to share the code it used to power its online portal for free with the HHS Department, which is building a similar website.

""Last week, the Oscar team built a COVID-19 risk assessment and testing center locator for our members,"" a spokeswoman for Oscar told Business Insider. ""The U.S government asked if we could share our code so that they could customize it for the website they are developing.""

HHS reached out to Oscar about the code on March 13, according to Business Insider. That’s the same day that Oscar rolled out its online portal in a press release. It’s also the same day that Trump announced a partnership with Google to build a similar website.

That timing likely fueled speculation on social media about an improper link between Oscar Health’s project and the White House’s broader testing efforts.

As the Verge reported, a diagram that the White House displayed during a press briefing that day resembled the step-by-step description Oscar Health gave in its press release.

But in reference to the diagram shown at the March 13 White House press conference, a White House spokesperson told Mother Jones that ""Oscar had no involvement in this.""

HHS referred us to the White House without comment.

Our ruling

A Facebook post says: ""So Oscar Health, the company tapped by Trump to profit from covid tests, is a Kushner company. Imagine that, profits over national safety.""

The Kushner family is connected to Oscar Health, a health insurance company that recently launched a website to help locate nearby testing centers for the novel coronavirus.

Business Insider reported that Oscar Health shared the code it developed with HHS after it made its online portal public. But we found no evidence that Trump formally designated the company to help with the White House’s COVID-19 testing efforts.

President Donald Trump visited Tennessee on March 6 to see the damage done by severe tornadoes that killed 25 people. He expressed his support for the affected communities after unlocking federal disaster relief funding for the region. But there were no reports that he wrote checks to anyone during his visit, despite what some social media posts are saying.

A Facebook post, which had been shared 20,000 times by March 17, says that Trump wrote personal checks to those affected by the tornadoes.

The White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment on the claim, and neither did the user on Facebook who posted the claim originally.

Trump flew into Berry Field Air National Guard Base in Nashville on Air Force One, according to the Tennessean.

Tennessee's U.S. senators, Lamar Alexander and Marsha Blackburn, accompanied Trump on his flight from Washington, the Tennessean reported. He was accompanied by other officials, too, according to reports. But not one mentioned Trump’s personal accountant making the trip.

Tennessean photos show that Trump took Marine One, the presidential helicopter, from the Nashville base to Cookeville, one of the areas hit hardest by the tornadoes. Trump surveyed the damage from the air in the helicopter, but he also spent some time on the ground, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham confirmed via tweet.

Trump pledged federal support for the community. A day earlier, Trump also issued a federal disaster declaration for the region, making federal funding available for relief efforts.

""We're going to take care of what they need,"" Trump said during his visit. ""We're going to be with them all the way.""

But there were no reports of Trump writing any checks during the visit, let alone personal ones.

Joe Manchin miscasts his remarks on stimulus aid,"• By contrast, Manchin said, workers who remain employed would not fit those criteria for receiving checks. Nor would people whose income consists of government checks that will remain steady and reliable, such as those who live on Social Security and/or disability checks.

• Manchin said he favors prioritizing aid for those who have suffered a direct financial hit due to recent business closures, such as the newly unemployed.

• The post mischaracterizes Manchin's idea about how best to target immediate federal aid due to the coronavirus pandemic.

As the coronavirus pandemic forces indefinite business closures, lawmakers are deciding what they can do to keep the economy afloat. One proposal is to send Americans $1,000 checks.

A March 18 Facebook post, shared more than 6,000 times, takes aim at Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and his views on the proposal.

The post, in a public Facebook group called West Virginia Citizens Against Joe Manchin, says the senator does not believe that West Virginians should receive these checks. The post says, ""Senator Joe Manchin hit (an) all time low saying seniors and the disabled did not need the relief package $1000 on Fox News.""

Did Manchin say he doesn’t want seniors and disabled people in West Virginia to receive the relief checks?

Not quite. The post leaves out important context. Manchin did say he believes the aid should be targeted to workers and businesses suffering a financial hit, such as lost income, due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Manchin was interviewed on Fox News on March 18. In the interview, he shared his view about the best way to target federal expenditures. He said that instead of sending $1,000 to those already receiving money from the government through worker’s compensation, disability, Social Security, Medicare and welfare — people who will not be seeing their incomes cut — it would be better to invest in existing programs designed to support families who have lost their paychecks due to the economic crisis, especially through unemployment insurance.

Here’s what Manchin told Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer:

""They don't need to send me $1,000, and I hope, Bill, they don't need to send you $1,000. There's a lot of people still working who have paychecks. There's people getting their workers' compensation, there are people getting their disability from Social Security, Social Security checks, Medicare, people on welfare. None of their lives are going to change from what it's been, except the inconvenience of not being able to socialize.

""The people we've got to get money to, Bill, (are) the people who have no paychecks now because we shut down everything. That's where we need to go. And it has to be through the unemployment comp(ensation) programs we already have in place. That does more for a long-term period than anything we do with a short-term check we send one time.""

Manchin’s office pointed us to a press release in which the senator explained that sending $1,000 checks to government employees who are still being paid does not solve the problem that unemployed workers are facing.

In the release, Manchin said, ""We can support American workers by removing the waiting period for those applying for unemployment, raising the dollar amount, and creating a small-business stimulus. But we do not need to be in the business of sending $1,000 checks to individuals like myself who are continuing to get a paycheck and not seeing negative financial impacts.""

Our ruling

The Facebook post in the public group West Virginia Citizens Against Joe Manchin said, ""Senator Joe Manchin hit an all time low saying seniors and the disabled did not need the relief package $1000 on Fox News.""

That’s misleading. Manchin said that federal government compensation should be targeted at those who have suffered a direct financial hit due to business closures, including the newly unemployed.

Manchin said that workers who remain employed would not fit those criteria for receiving checks. Nor would people whose income consists of government checks that remain steady and reliable, such as those who live on Social Security and/or disability checks.

This is a nuanced position involving how to structure government aid, rather than a shot at seniors and the disabled, as the post suggests. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/23/dan-crenshaw/did-fda-regulations-slow-testing-coronavirus/,2020-03-23T00:00:00,Did FDA regulations slow testing for the coronavirus?,"Accusations about the responsible party behind the United States’ struggle to accelerate coronavirus testing have come from every which way and the blame has fallen, often inaccurately, on the shoulders of different public officials.

In a March 13 tweet, President Donald Trump said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied its testing system for decades but wasn’t prepared for a large scale pandemic, an issue that was complicated by policy changes made by former President Barack Obama.

U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., retweeted Trump’s remark and added his own comment: ""Trump is once again trying to blame the previous administration for the number of tests available. This is his #DailyLie.""

U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston, retweeted Schumer’s remark and said: ""It’s not Obama’s fault and it’s not Trump’s fault. We have stringent FDA regulations, long in place, that created barriers to the private industry creating a test quickly.""

PolitiFact looked at a different Trump claim blaming Obama for a lack of testing and rated it False. We also looked at a Mostly False claim from Democrat Joe Biden about the Trump administration rejecting tests from the World Health Organization (they were never offered). Trump also inaccurately stated that any individual who wants to be tested for the coronavirus can get a test — we rated that statement Pants on Fire.

We wanted to dig deeper into Crenshaw’s claim, which attributes the delays in the availability of widespread testing to Food and Drug Administration regulations.

Justin Discigil, spokesman for Crenshaw, pointed to articles from ProPublica, the New Yorker, The Atlantic and the Washington Post, all of which highlighted the role FDA regulations played here.

He added: ""Just to be clear – nowhere did we say that these regulations were the sole/only reason for the testing issue, we said that they created barriers.""

A timeline of events

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States came at the end of January, when a man in Washington state developed symptoms after returning from a trip to Wuhan.

One month later, federal health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was inevitable that the U.S. would experience a spread of the virus and urged people to take precautions.

In these early days of the virus, tests were not widely distributed to local and state laboratories. Instead, testing for the new coronavirus was conducted almost entirely by the CDC — samples collected at the local level were sent to the agency.

Initial test kits developed by the CDC for use in local and state labs were flawed and produced inaccurate results in some labs, meaning they couldn’t be distributed. As the agency worked to correct the tests, health officials turned to the FDA.

The U.S. Association of Public Health Laboratories submitted a letter asking the agency to use ""enforcement discretion"" and authorize local and state labs to develop and use their own tests.

During a public health emergency, labs and drug manufacturers must seek an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA to use diagnostic tests and medical treatments that have not gone through the typical clearance process — to share them faster in the emergency.

(These authorizations were begun in 2004 under President George W. Bush.)

For laboratory-developed tests, like the ones in question, FDA policy has stated that they cannot be used in clinical diagnoses without the FDA’s approval during an emergency.

Although the goal of these regulations is to ensure only accurate lab tests are conducted, health officials have said they prevented them from quickly responding to the virus.

One doctor in a Seattle lab described the process for getting an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA and said the agency asked for a level of testing that didn’t make sense in the context of an emergency, according to a GQ profile.

A doctor in North Carolina told NBC News that she had developed a test using the World Health Organization’s protocol but had yet to receive the use authorization from the FDA, putting the state ""way behind"" in its ability to test patients.

On Feb. 29, the FDA announced a change in the process: Labs would still need to seek the agency’s approval for their tests, but the labs could begin testing while waiting for the official green light.

On March 16, (three days after Crenshaw made his claim) the FDA announced another change to its policies and put state officials in charge of coronavirus tests developed by laboratories in their states, meaning labs would engage with state officials and not the FDA. It also removes the requirement for these labs to apply for an Emergency Use Authorization for their tests.

The changes also expand which labs and manufacturers are included in FDA guidelines and which kinds of tests can be developed.

""We believe the unprecedented policy set forth in today’s updated guidance, which addresses laboratories and commercial manufacturers, will help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to expand the number and variety of diagnostic tests, as well as available testing capabilities in health care settings, and reference and commercial laboratories,"" reads a release from the agency.

After the changes

After the FDA announced changes to its policies, Labcorps and Quest Diagnostics both announced plans to start testing for the new coronavirus, crediting changes in federal policy with their ability to do so.

""We applaud the FDA for providing the flexibility for innovative, quality lab developed tests to be brought to patients and providers quickly to advance effective response to the coronavirus outbreak,"" said Steve Rusckowski, chairman and chief executive officer of Quest Diagnostics, in a statement.

But even as state and local authorities move to ramp up testing, the number of available tests is still lacking.

In Austin, for example, there is still a gap between available test kids and demand for testing, as officials prioritize testing for health care workers, people living in nursing homes and people at high risk for complications from the virus.

Our Ruling

Crenshaw said in a tweet that longstanding FDA regulations ""created barriers to the private industry creating a test quickly"" for the coronavirus.

Crenshaw’s statement is accurate. FDA procedures adopted in 2004 meant laboratories had to seek the agency’s approval before developing and using tests in communities, a policy many health care officials have said prevented the country from taking early action in response to the novel coronavirus.

It is important to keep in mind that other factors have contributed to the low levels of testing for the virus, beyond the FDA regulations.

But Crenshaw’s statement is accurate. We rate it True."

Wisconsin is indeed the only one of the 50 states where all Republicans voted no.

In just over 24 hours, some 12,000 people shared a post from the Kenosha County Democratic party slamming the coronavirus vote by Wisconsin’s Republican congressional delegation.

The emergency measure — which includes free testing for COVID-19, paid emergency leave and other emergency appropriations — easily passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 18, 2020.

But it passed without much help from Wisconsin.

The Kenosha Democrats seized on that fact in a March 19, 2020, Facebook post. The post explained the bill, commented on gerrymandering and noted the GOP no votes from purple Wisconsin went beyond the breakdown from even the deepest red of the red states.

It was accompanied by a graphic with pictures of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and U.S. Reps. Mike Gallagher, Glenn Grothman, Jim Sensenbrenner and Bryan Steil that said this: ""WI is the ONLY state where all Republicans voted against protecting its citizens.""

This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

Let’s check it out.

The votes

The bill passed 363-40 in the U.S. House and 90-8 in the U.S. Senate.

Indeed, all five Republicans in the Wisconsin delegation cast a no vote, according to roll calls published by ProPublica. All four state Democrats voted for the bill.

And, yes, that clean sweep of Republican votes was unique around the country.

In Oklahoma both Republican senators voted against the bill, but two of three Republican representatives supported it. Iowa’s lone Republican representative voted no, but both Republican senators there supported the bill.

The summary

That leaves us to look at the characterization that Wisconsin Republicans ""voted against protecting (the state’s) citizens""?

Like anything in politics, it’s more complicated than that. In various statements issued after the votes, the state’s Republican lawmakers didn’t object to the concept of providing help amid the pandemic, but they took issue with numerous specifics in the bill and how the process was handled.

Sensenbrenner objected to spending money on a bill that he said stretched 100 pages and was presented with less than 30 minutes to review.

""We do not know the full cost of this legislation,"" he said in a statement. ""I am not a fan of passing bills to find out what is in them.""

Steil told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he voted against the bill because it ""places a heavy government mandate on Wisconsin small businesses that are already suffering negative consequences from coronavirus.""

Gallagher echoed those comments in a statement, saying he feared the bill would hurt small businesses.

""This bill, while well-intentioned, contains a number of unclear provisions that could force small businesses in Northeast Wisconsin to lay off workers or cause them to close their doors altogether,"" Gallagher said. ""Let me be clear: H.R. 6201 contained a number of good provisions like free testing that we’ve already successfully fought for. But I have serious questions as to whether the best way to support those needing paid and sick leave is through tax credits to small businesses instead of direct payments to those affected.""

Lori Hawkins, chair of the Kenosha County Democratic Party, defended the description in the Facebook post. She said the bill guided both testing and treatment to help control the spread of the disease.

""A 'no' vote by our elected officials was a vote against protecting their constituents from this highly contagious disease which has already been deadly to residents in Wisconsin,"" she said in an email.

Our ruling

A viral Facebook post said Wisconsin ""is the only state where all Republicans voted against protecting its citizens.""

It is indeed the only state where all Republicans opposed the bill, which has now become law.

But it’s a bit of an exaggeration to summarize their decisions as a vote ""against protecting (Wisconsin) citizens."" And of course this is expected to be just the first of many bills addressing the coronavirus fallout.

The post said: ""Important! No Elderberry and no NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Motrin, Aleve, Naproxyn, etc) if you suspect you have been exposed to COVID19.""

It adds: ""Data showing elderberry may actually make things worse since COVID19 causes respiratory failure via a cytokine response/release. Elderberry normal increases immune response, but the process of ARDS is actually an over-activation of the immune system. Elderberry increases cytokine release. That is part of the over-reaction. Elderberry may be great for influenza, but is bad for COVID19 and serious sequela. Ibuprofen has a similar effect. Avoid it. #choosetylenol #flattenthecurve.""

The Facebook user later updated the post to clarify her advice: ""I said if suspected exposure. If you are taking it, continue but consider stopping if you get exposed or get the disease.""

Given limited evidence at this point on what is effective or harmful to treat COVID-19, it is difficult to make a definitive claim on whether elderberry should be avoided by people exposed to the disease.

RELATED: Will taking ibuprofen for COVID-19 cause more health problems? It’s complicated

Elderberry — a term commonly used for both the plant and the fruit it produces — is known for its natural antioxidants and vitamin C. A few studies suggest that elderberry can slightly relieve flu symptoms. (Some people consume elderberry extract in gummies or syrup.) Researchers, however, say that more studies and evidence are needed to know if there is a medically proven benefit from taking elderberry.

Does it make things worse for people exposed to COVID-19?

We asked the Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the World Health Organization, whether elderberry should be avoided by someone exposed to COVID-19. We did not get a response to that from any of the organizations. The Facebook user who wrote the post did not reply to our query, either.

Two experts who got back to us said they were not aware or could not confirm whether elderberry is bad for people exposed to COVID-19.

""There are some data suggesting that COVID infection, especially later in severe illness, may have a significant cytokine surge causing or contributing to the pathology,"" said David Cennimo, an infectious-disease expert and assistant professor at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. ""I am not aware of data on elderberry and cytokines or COVID specifically.""

The FDA on March 6 sent a warning letter to a company that was selling herbal products to combat COVID-19, including one called ""elderberry tincture."" The FDA said the products were unapproved and misbranded.

""There currently are no vaccines, pills, potions, lotions, lozenges or other prescription or over-the-counter products available to treat or cure coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"" the letter said."

One Facebook post shows an image of a woman wearing a medical mask alongside a graphic of a virus. ""People with Type A blood are significantly more likely to catch coronavirus than those with Type O, Chinese academics have found,"" the image reads.

The post is based on the findings of a group of researchers at Chinese hospitals and universities who studied 2,173 patients from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China, who had tested positive for COVID-19.

But experts warn that the findings haven’t been validated. The study was made public on medRxiv, an online archive where researchers can post ""complete but unpublished"" medical research to generate debate among experts.

""Preprints are preliminary reports of work that have not been certified by peer review,"" the site is careful to emphasize. ""They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior and should not be reported in news media as established information.""

The researchers said that the distribution of blood types for the general population in Wuhan, China, was:

A: 32.16%

B: 24.9%

AB: 9.1%

O: 33.84%

For those who tested positive for COVID-19 at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, they said, the blood type distribution was:

A: 37.75%

B: 26.42%

AB: 10.03%

O: 25.8%

Based on metaanalysis of this data, the researchers concluded that people with blood type A ""have a significantly higher risk for acquiring COVID-19,"" while individuals with blood group O have ""a significantly lower risk for the infection"" when compared to other blood groups.

The study’s conclusions were reported by several news outlets including, the South China Morning Post, Newsweek, Science Focus, Science Alert and Medical News Today.

However, almost all of the outlets reported that the study was not published by a reputable medical journal or peer reviewed before it was posted online.

Doctors and medical researchers recommended caution before accepting the study’s conclusions as fact or letting the findings guide decision-making.

Gao Yingdai, a researcher from the State Key Laboratory of Hematology in Tianjin, China, told the South China Morning Post the study could have been improved with a larger sample size or a clear explanation for the correlation they described.

The study ""may be helpful to medical professionals, but ordinary citizens should not take the statistics too seriously,"" Gao told the South China Morning Post.

She said people with type A blood should not panic and those with type O blood shouldn’t let their guard down.

Dr. Sakthivel Vaiyapuri, an associate professor at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom, advised ignoring the study.

""It’s better to safely ignore any article that hasn’t been properly scrutinized by peer review and published in a rigorous scientific journal,"" Vaiyapuri said to PolitiFact in an email.

Vaiyapuri said the study lacked ""robust scientific validation"" and expressed concern that it would cause individuals with type A blood to panic.

""Even if they get mild symptoms, instead of self-isolating themselves at home, they will start to queue up in the hospitals for higher level of treatment,"" he said. ""This will cause serious issues for health care facilities and staff.""

Vaiyapuri pointed out that the study had several limitations, including a sample size he described as too small.

""They also haven’t considered several other parameters which might have changed the conclusion completely,"" he said. ""Moreover, they did not see any effect in one hospital that they analyzed. So this study is too speculative, and data are not robust to make any firm conclusions. People should not panic based on the outcomes of this study."""

Doctors don’t know yet,"Health experts say a small number of women who were infected with COVID-19 in their pregnancies delivered healthy babies, but there’s still not enough known about the virus to make a determination.

Are pregnant women at a higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19?

A Facebook post, which appears to be a screenshot from a news article, makes that claim:

""Because of changes in their immune system, pregnant women are at a higher risk when it comes to coronavirus."" The story quotes a Michigan doctor who says the virus can make it harder to breathe, which poses a particular risk for women further along in their pregnancies.

This isn’t false, but it’s speculative.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

Since COVID-19 is so new, doctors are still learning how it spreads and the severity of illness it causes. There is not enough known to say for sure how it affects pregnant women and their babies.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that doctors don’t know if pregnant women have a greater chance of getting sick from COVID-19 than the general public. They also don’t yet know whether expectant mothers are more likely to have serious illness as a result:

""Pregnant women experience changes in their bodies that may increase their risk of some infections,"" the CDC says. ""With viruses from the same family as COVID-19, and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, women have had a higher risk of developing severe illness. It is always important for pregnant women to protect themselves from illnesses.""

The CDC also says it’s not known whether a pregnant woman with the virus can pass it onto her fetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. There have been a small number of reported cases in which infants were born to mothers with COVID-19, but none have tested positive for the virus in the United States. COVID-19 was also not found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk, according to the organization.

The United Kingdom’s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reports that while there’s no evidence an expectant mother can pass the virus to her baby while pregnant or during birth, they have seen two cases of possible transmission.

""In both cases, it remains unclear whether transmission was prior to or soon after birth,"" the organization said. ""Another recent report from China of four women with coronavirus infection when they gave birth found no evidence of the infection in their newborn babies. Expert opinion is that the baby is unlikely to be exposed during pregnancy. It is also therefore considered unlikely that if you have the virus it would cause problems with the baby’s development, and none have been observed currently.""

In a March 16 press briefing, President Donald Trump was asked if pregnancy was considered an underlying condition that could create more complications of the coronavirus.

Dr. Deborah Birx, who serves as White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, answered the question:

""There’s very little data in pregnant women. I think, about a week ago, I said that reports that came in from China, from the Chinese CDC, of the nine women who were documented to be pregnant and have coronavirus in their last trimester, delivered healthy children and they themselves were healthy and recovered. That is our total sample size, and we will be getting more data from countries.""

Like many questions about COVID-19, there’s not enough information to give a definitive answer on how it affects pregnant women and their babies.

Officials say the small number of women who were infected with COVID-19 in their pregnancies delivered healthy babies, but there’s still not enough known about the virus to make a determination. Health experts recommend pregnant women take precautions to avoid infection."

It’s complicated,"• A more far-reaching step would be for the government to take control of the supply chain for key medical products. That step has not been taken, despite strong urging from the medical community.

• Some powers in the law are not considered controversial and are expected to be executed soon, such as requiring businesses to prioritize contracts for medical supplies.

• Trump recently invoked the act by executive order. However, there’s a difference between invoking the act and actually using its powers.

• The Defense Production Act gives the federal government the power to direct private businesses to produce crucial items in a national emergency, such as the coronavirus pandemic.

As the coronavirus spreads across the United States, there’s increasing discussion of how to leverage an existing law to quickly scale up the manufacture of ventilators and other urgently needed medical items.

The Defense Production Act, signed by President Harry Truman, allows the federal government to take a stronger role in directing domestic manufacturing capabilities during a national emergency.

Both Trump and his critics have talked about the Defense Production Act as concerns grow about shortages of protective gear, ventilators, and other devices needed to contain the pandemic.

On March 18, Trump tweeted, ""I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!"" (By saying he ""signed"" the act, Trump appears to have meant that he signed an executive order to invoke it.)

I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2020

The following day, a reporter asked Trump what conditions would be needed to put the act into effect. He responded, ""Well, if we were desperately in need of something — and we, frankly, will know about that very shortly. We don't want to do it as it happens, but before it happens.""

Trump’s seeming reluctance to fully invoke the act led Democratic critics, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, to demand that he act more forcefully.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden tweeted that Trump was not acting fast enough: ""Yesterday, President Trump said he was invoking the Defense Production Act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it. The President should exercise these powers now. We need more ventilators, protective equipment, and critical supplies. We need action, not words.""

Confusion, and frustration, continued into the weekend, as the number of known cases in the United States passed 29,000.

The American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and the American Nurses Association pleaded together in a letter for Trump to ""immediately"" use the Defense Production Act for the production of medical supplies, protective gear and testing equipment.

So what’s going on here? Has the president invoked the act or not?

Trump has authorized the act’s use, but only followed through on implementing certain provisions of it.

Let’s explain further.

What is the Defense Production Act?

The Defense Production Act, which was passed in 1950 and amended periodically since, provides the president a set of powers to influence domestic industry in the interest of national security, according to the Congressional Research Service. These powers are designed to ensure the flow of essential materials by allowing the government to tell private businesses when and how to fulfill orders for those goods. Over the years, its scope has been expanded from military needs to natural hazards, terrorist attacks, and other national emergencies.

For instance, in 2001, Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush invoked the law during an energy crisis in California, affecting electricity and natural gas companies. It was also invoked during the Iraq War and in the aftermath of the 2017 hurricane in Puerto Rico.

""The DPA is one of those seemingly obscure laws that is actually extraordinarily significant,"" said Margaret O’Mara, a University of Washington historian who studies the connections between government and industry.

What has Trump done?

Because the act is an existing statute, activating it only requires an administrative action by the president.

So, on March 18, Trump signed an executive order invoking portions of the act to curb the spread of coronavirus.

He specifically invoked Title I, part of which involves prioritizing contracts that serve national emergency goals over any other contracts or orders. Under this provision, the Department of Health and Human Services essentially makes sure that companies produce the emergency items first, rather than fulfilling orders for other customers, such as those overseas. (Trump didn’t need to authorize a different part of the law, Title III, which involves the authority to make loan guarantees, loans, purchases, and commitments to purchase items, because this provision had already been authorized by President Barack Obama in 2012.)

Trump’s executive order specifically named ""personal protective equipment and ventilators,"" both of which are in short supply and are considered central to the fight against coronavirus.

This part of the law is not considered controversial and is expected to be implemented by HHS in the coming days and weeks.

What hasn’t Trump done yet?

However, Trump also deputized HHS to pursue an additional, much more aggressive course under Title I: having certain executive-branch officials determine the allocation of ""all health and medical resources, including controlling the distribution of such materials ... in the civilian market.""

In practical terms, this would allow the government to take over the supply chain for certain aspects of the private economy — a striking flex of governmental muscle over the private sector.

This is the action that many medical professionals and state and local officials would like to see, essentially having the government order companies to produce certain goods.

Just because Trump deputized HHS to exercise these powers doesn’t mean that a government takeover of private businesses is starting yet. There’s a practical difference between delegating the authority to an agency and having the agency exercise it. And the latter is what hasn’t happened yet.

Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Peter Gaynor was asked about it point-blank on CNN’s State of the Union on March 22.

""Has the president, as of now ... ordered any companies to make more of any of these critical supplies?"" Jake Tapper asked Gaynor.

""No, we haven't yet,"" Gaynor replied. The Defense Production Act ""really is leverage to demonstrate that we can use it, the president can use it any time.""

Gaynor told Tapper that companies are now mobilizing to produce needed equipment, so forcing them to act isn’t necessary. ""It's happening without using that lever,"" he said. ""If it comes to a point and we have to pull that lever, we will.""

There are some public signs that private companies are willing to switch their production to urgently needed goods. For instance, automakers have floated the idea of converting their idle production lines to ventilator manufacturing, and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has pledged to start producing masks and ventilators.

But critics, like governors and the three medical trade associations, say that voluntary actions aren’t enough to fill the need quickly.

""I think the federal government should order factories to manufacture masks, gowns, ventilators, the essential medical equipment that is going to make the difference between life and death,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said March 22. ""It's not hard to make a mask or (personal protective equipment) or a gown, but you need companies to do it."""

Newsom Leaves Out Key Context In Claim 56% Of Californians Will Get Infected With Coronavirus,"Newsom claimed 56 percent of Californians will get the coronavirus over the next eight weeks.

Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed in a letter to President Trump this week that a staggering ""56 percent"" of Californians ""will be infected"" with the coronavirus over the next two months. A day later, Newsom ordered all residents to stay at home and avoid all non-essential travel to slow the spread of the virus.

While his order made big news, so did his projection about how many Californians would get infected. News outlets around the globe ran with the statistic: The New York Post: ""California governor says 25.5 million residents will get coronavirus."" A French media outlet wrote: ""California governor orders residents to stay home, says more than half could get virus.""

Gov. Newsom's claim about 56 percent of Californians getting infected with coronavirus was reported without key context by news outlets around the nation and globe.

The letter was dated March 18 and made public just hours before the governor’s stay-at-home directive. In the letter, Newsom asked Trump to deploy the USNS Mercy Hospital Ship to the Port of Los Angeles to help with the expected strain on the region’s hospital capacity from the virus. Right after making this request, Newsom makes his assertion:

""We project roughly 56 percent of our population — 25.5 million people — will be infected with the virus over an eight-week period.""

Given the intense focus on his words, PolitiFact California took a closer look at the governor’s statement and found it lacks crucial context. A governor’s spokesperson later acknowledged it doesn’t take into account any mitigation measures put in place before Newsom wrote to Trump, such as last week’s statewide school closures or the San Francisco Bay Area’s stay-at-home orders early this week.

We won’t place a formal Truth-O-Meter rating on it. It’s difficult to give a precise rating to a prediction.

Instead, we’ll examine what was known when Newsom made the claim, the reaction to it and the missing context the governor and his staff offered hours after his letter was published.

How Did Newsom Come Up With The 56 Percent Projection?

Mark Ghaly, the governor’s Secretary of Health and Human Services, explained at a press conference Thursday how the state came up with the 56 percent estimate.

He said the state knew a month ago it needed a model for projecting how fast the virus would spread and the strain it might place on hospital resources. State officials relied on ""the best thinking from around the globe,"" to come up with projections, Ghaly said.

""Using the available literature, advice from the CDC and our understanding and experience in California, we applied a variety of different measures that looked at an attack rate,"" the secretary continued, referring to the rate at which people could become infected. He also noted the state projected ""hospitalization rates.""

""We knew that the attack rate of 56 percent that we chose was somewhat in the middle between the high-end and the low-end of what we’d seen in the literature,"" he said.

Ghaly added that the estimate is based on the scenario where ""if we did nothing across California and it spread the way that we’d seen the spread of disease in other countries.""

What Do Experts Say?

Several infectious disease experts told the San Francisco Chronicle that they viewed the 56 percent figure as ""a worst-case scenario and, though certainly possible, unlikely to actually happen,"" the newspaper reported.

""I think the governor is acting wisely in asking for better preparedness, but the extreme, worse scenario is unlikely to come true,"" Stanford epidemiologist John Ioannidis told the Chronicle.

In a letter to Stat news published on Monday, Ioannidis said the data collected on the pandemic is unreliable, and the projections in turn are questionable.

After questions were raised about the statistic, the governor’s spokesman issued this statement yesterday:

""Gov. Newsom has been honest about the threat of the virus and its impact on the health and welfare of Californians. This projection shows why it’s so critical that Californians take action to slow the spread of the disease — and those mitigation efforts aren’t taken into account in that number,"" spokesman Nathan Click said in a statement, as reported by the Chronicle. ""The state is deploying every resource at its disposal to meet this challenge, and we continue to ask for the federal government’s assistance in this fight.""

The governor’s office did not respond today to more detailed questions, including why Newsom omitted the context about mitigation efforts.

Hours after the letter was published, Newsom provided more information about the 56 percent figure, during his press conference announcing the statewide stay-at-home order:

""The numbers we put out today assume we're just along for the ride, we're not. We want to manipulate this number down, that's what this order is all about,"" he said.

We asked Christine K. Johnson, an epidemiologist at UC Davis, about the governor’s projections. She told us she was not familiar with the models used by the governor, but noted the 56 percent figure ""was well within"" global estimates.

""The epidemic modeling shows a very bleak picture if we do nothing,"" Johnson added.

She said the governor’s order to shut down non-essential travel is necessary to prevent an overload of the state’s hospital system.

Asked whether the governor’s statement needed more information, Johnson responded:

""I think the context is incredibly important,"" she said. ""There’s no way people are going to do nothing. So, that’s unrealistic. It is in our power to ensure that no other people can get infected. I think if we maintain social distancing, we have ultimate control over the number of people that are going to get this virus.""

Our Conclusion

Newsom claimed that 56 percent of Californians ""will get infected"" with the coronavirus, based on state projections. But he left out a massive point: His figure assumes that nothing is done to stop the spread of the virus. Yet huge changes were already underway statewide when he made his statement, from school closures to the Bay Area ordering nearly 7 million residents to stay at home.

Infectious disease experts described Newsom’s statistic as a worst-case scenario, something his letter failed to mention. Though the governor’s warnings are important, his words should have included this key context."

(That’s Pants on Fire.)

The day the stock market plummeted, Trump said the virus was very much under control in the U.S., and the stock market was looking pretty good to him.

After the disease was in Washington state and the World Health Organization reported a high global risk, Trump said there were no worries of a pandemic.

In the span of three months, Americans went from hearing about a new virus in central China to being told they ought to stay home and avoid groups larger than 10. President Donald Trump went from telling people not to worry and everything was under control to leading daily press conferences on containing the outbreak in the United States.

The rapidly evolving story can be broken down into three phases: the emergence of the threat, the government’s focus on keeping it out of the United States, and finally, its efforts to contain the spread.

Here are the key moments in each phase, and what Trump said at those times — fact-checked.

The disease emerges

Dec. 31: China confirms existence of a new virus.

Jan. 20: World Health Organization reports cases in China, Thailand, Japan, and South Korea.

Jan. 21: The first U.S. case is announced in Washington state (as well as Vietnam and Singapore). WHO says the virus risk globally is high.

Jan. 22: A reporter asks if there are worries about a pandemic. Trump responds:

""No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s — going to be just fine.""

Jan. 24: Trump tweets, ""It will all work out well.""

China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020

Jan 29: The White House forms a coronavirus response task force, initially led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.

Jan. 30: The WHO declares a global health emergency.

Phase Two: Keeping it out of the United States

Jan. 30: Trump blocks travel from China.

The same night, he holds a campaign rally in Iowa.

""We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five. ... we think it’s going to have a very good ending for it.""

Feb. 2: Trump tells Fox News host Sean Hannity, ""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.""

Feb. 4: Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama, Japan. Over 2,600 guests and over 1,000 crew. Within two days, over 40 people test positive for COVID-19, including eight Americans.

Feb. 11: WHO names the new virus COVID-19.

Feb 14: Trump discusses the ""very small"" number of U.S. coronavirus cases with Border Patrol Council members:

""We have a very small number of people in the country, right now, with it. It’s like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we’re in very good shape.""

Feb. 20: WHO reports nearly 77,000 cases worldwide in 27 countries.

Feb. 24: Stock market plummets as Dow Jones Industrials falls more than 1,000 points.

The same day, Trump asks for $1.25 billion in emergency aid. It grows to $8.3 billion in Congress.He tweets that the virus ""is very much under control"" and the stock market ""starting to look very good to me!""

The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2020

Feb. 26: The first case emerges in California with no clear source, suggesting community spread of the virus.

In a news conference that day, Trump says the United States is ""really prepared."" He puts Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the White House task force.

Feb. 28: Cases rise across Europe, including Italy, Germany, France, England, Switzerland and Belarus.

Phase Three: Containing the spread

Feb. 29: FDA eases guidelines to speed the broader use of testing.

March 4: House passes $8.3 billion emergency bill, aimed mainly at the immediate health response to the virus.

In a Fox News interview, Trump deflects criticism to his response by saying the Obama administration (including the vice president, Joe Biden) ""didn't do anything about"" swine flu. We rated the claim False.

Trump continues to blame the Obama administration in an exchange with reporters at the White House.

""The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we’re doing.""

Our fact-check shows the process dated back to 2006, before Obama took office. So the claim is False.

March 6: Grand Princess cruise ship with over 2,000 passengers waits to dock off the California coast.

Asked about the docking of the Grand Princess, Trump says the following:

""I would rather (Grand Princess passengers stay aboard) because I like the numbers being where they are. I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship.""

Trump went on to say that he thought it was more important for passengers to debark than to keep the numbers down.

In a news conference, Trump downplays the concerns around testing:

""Anybody that wants a test can get a test.""

With tests in short supply, we rated the claim Pants on Fire.

The same day, Trump tweets out blame to the media and the Democrats for trying to ""inflame"" the situation ""far beyond what the facts would warrant.""

The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, “The risk is low to the average American.” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 9, 2020

March 11: On the same day the WHO declares COVID-19 a pandemic, Trump uses a prime-time Oval Office address to announce a ban on travel for non-Americans from most of Europe. He misstates a freeze on cargo and falsely said the health insurance industry has ""agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments."" In reality, getting tested would be free, but treatment would not be covered.

March 13: Trump declares a national emergency to access $50 billion for states and territories, and clear the way for fast-track waivers for hospitals and doctors as they respond to the virus.

March 14: The House passes a worker and business relief bill with paid leave guarantees for certain workers, expanded food assistance and unemployment insurance benefits, and employer tax credits. Trump signs it four days later.

March 17: Trump said in a news conference that for the next 14 days, ""we’re asking everyone to work at home, if possible, postpone unnecessary travel, and limit social gatherings to no more than 10 people.""

Trump says there was no shift in tone from the White House.

""I've always known this is a real, this is a pandemic. I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.""

As this timeline shows, Trump minimized the threat of a pandemic for many weeks. Pants on Fire!

Asked if the World Health Organization had offered detection tests to the United States, Trump said WHO had not, and that the WHO coronavirus test ""was a bad test."" False. WHO said three independent labs had validated the test, and the White House coordinator for coronavirus response said she assumed the WHO test is effective.

March 19: The U.S. Senate unveils a $1 trillion-plus economic stimulus package. California orders lockdown for 40 million residents.

March 20: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered all non-essential businesses to keep their workers home."

So in this edition of Ask PolitiFact, we answered more of our readers’ questions about the virus. We read the latest research on how long the coronavirus can live on different surfaces and consulted with experts about whether people should really avoid ibuprofen for treating COVID-19 symptoms. To submit your own question for a future story, fill out this form.

For more reporting on coronavirus seasonality, immunity and transmission, check out this story.

For information about government action on the coronavirus, read this one, too.

How long is this virus capable of infecting people from surfaces?

Preliminary research suggests that it depends on the type of surface, but it can be as long as a few days.

In an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17, researchers tested how long the coronavirus, formally called SARS-CoV-2, lived on five different surfaces: aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard.

""SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours),"" the authors wrote. ""SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard.""

Aside from air, the worst surface for the virus is copper; researchers could only detect viable virus particles there for up to four hours. On cardboard, they could not detect any after 24 hours. The coronavirus lives the longest on plastic and stainless steel — up to three days.

It’s worth noting that the article is not a peer-reviewed study, and researchers tested the lifespan of SARS-CoV-2 in a lab setting. But their findings reflect what others have found about the potential longevity of the coronavirus outside the body. Read more in this fact-check.

How long can the virus live on US coins? Any special precautions to take with change? Any way to disinfect the coins safely?

It depends on what the money is made of.

The Journal of Hospital Infection article says human coronaviruses could live on paper for anywhere between one to five days. The U.S. Dollar is made up of 75% cotton and 25% linen, as opposed to wood pulp, which is the base for most paper.

Still, you’re probably safer handling coins. The New England Journal of Medicine article found that COVID-19 can only survive for up to four hours on copper, which is what quarters, nickels and dimes are primarily made of. Ironically, pennies are made primarily of zinc, although they have a copper exterior.

The World Health Organization advises people to wash their hands with soap and water after handling banknotes, coins and credit cards. If you’re feeling paranoid, you could disinfect coins using cleaners that contain at least 60% alcohol, or products from companies like Lysol and Clorox that have proven effective against other human coronaviruses. Apply less cleaner to bills, which are likely to tear when wet.

What is the treatment for people who test positive for coronavirus?

As of now, there is no specific treatment for people infected with COVID-19. But there are some things they can do to alleviate their symptoms while in self-quarantine.

The coronavirus is a virus, meaning antibiotics don’t work against the infection. There also aren’t currently any antiviral medications recommended to treat COVID-19, although President Donald Trump has said the Food and Drug Administration is fast-tracking potential treatments.

According to the Mayo Clinic, there are still a few things patients with the coronavirus can do to alleviate symptoms, which include cough, shortness of breath and fever. Cough medicine, pain and fever relievers, rest, and fluids are all recommended.

Is it really recommended to avoid ibuprofen if you have COVID-19?

In the U.S., not as of now. But it’s complicated.

French doctors recently cast doubt on using ibuprofen, a fever and pain reliever, to treat the coronavirus. Some experts believe ibuprofen’s anti-inflammatory properties could dampen the immune system’s response to fighting off COVID-19.

But professionals also say this is just a theory and that there’s no scientific evidence that links ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory medications with COVID-19 complications. American health officials have found no evidence that the over-the-counter drug is not safe for COVID-19 patients to use.

Still, England's National Health Service is one of the organizations that is recommending people err on the side of caution.

""Until we have more info, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you,"" NHS wrote March 18. Paracetamol is also known as acetaminophen.

There is not enough credible information to say for sure whether ibuprofen can negatively impact patients with coronavirus. Right now, people should remain skeptical about sweeping statements that make bold claims about ibuprofen and the virus (like the one that inspired this fact-check).

Are beaches safe to visit during social distancing?

It depends on how crowded they are.

Public health officials have advised Americans to practice ""social distancing,"" or avoiding crowded public spaces. The White House has advised Americans to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people. In some places, groups that large are banned.

While there is no guidance from public health officials on beaches, you’re probably safe as long as you keep your distance from other people and practice good personal hygiene. But many beaches are closing to avoid creating crowds.

After national news outlets broadcasted footage showing throngs of spring breakers on the beach in Clearwater, Fla., local officials voted to close all county beaches. Officials in Miami, Fort Myers and other vacation destinations in Florida, as well as neighboring Alabama and Georgia, have decided to do the same.

The problem isn’t necessarily the beaches themselves — it’s the overcrowding. Even in places with mandatory shelter in place orders, such as California, people can still go outside and get some fresh air.

So if your local beach is open, just make sure to stay the recommended distance of at least six feet away from others. Wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face to prevent the transmission of germs."

It’s complicated,"But professionals also say this is just a theory and that there’s no scientific evidence that links ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory medications with COVID-19 complications.

Some medical experts believe ibuprofen’s anti-inflammatory properties could dampen the immune system’s response to fighting off COVID-19.

Got a fever? Feeling achy? If so, it makes sense that you’d want to take ibuprofen, the over-the-counter anti-inflammatory often recommended for those symptoms.

But recent claims on social media warn that this everyday remedy could increase the risk of complications with a COVID-19 infection.

Is there any truth here?

We have a two-part answer. Medical experts say the claim has no scientific backing. But they also acknowledge that more research needs to be done, especially with respect to patients with certain conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. Public health experts in England, at least, said the question is significant enough that its National Health Service recommended some patients exercise caution.

The claims

A Facebook post claims it’s dangerous to take ibuprofen if you have COVID-19 and suggests the virus ""thrives"" on the medicine.

""I have a doctor in the family who has been given information from Vienna’s laboratory studying COVID-19 and (sic) vast majority of people who died of it, had ibuprofen in their system so do not take it!! Those who recovered did not take ibuprofen so if you have symptoms, take Paracetamol only!!! Looks like this virus thrives on ibuprofen so don’t do it and tell everyone you can!!!""

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

This information is based on some genuine medical advice, but it distorts facts and makes unfounded assertions.

First, we could find no credible evidence that states that the ""vast majority"" of the thousands who have died with COVID-19 so far all had ibuprofen in their systems. Nor have we seen any medical experts suggest that the medicine played a role in any of these COVID-19 related deaths.

Rumors about ibuprofen and COVID-19 largely took off after France’s Health Minister, Olivier Véran, tweeted that ""taking anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, cortisone …) could be a factor in worsening the infection. If you have a fever, take paracetamol."" Paracetamol is the generic name used in Europe for acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol.

Some European doctors and scientists agreed with him and have recommended people take a drug like Tylenol instead of ibuprofen or Advil as scientists study the matter. But other medical experts say there’s no scientific evidence that links anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen with worsening COVID-19 infections.

To cut through the confusion, we’ve compiled responses from health experts to give you the best idea on what the medical community knows, and recommends, regarding ibuprofen and COVID-19.

More research needed

A statement from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases says evidence is scarce and there needs to be more research:

""More research is needed to evaluate reports that ibuprofen and other over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs may affect the course of COVID-19. Currently, there is no conclusive evidence that ibuprofen and other over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs increases the risk of serious complications or of acquiring the virus that causes COVID-19. There is also no conclusive evidence that taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs is harmful for other respiratory infections.""

The World Health Organization told PolitiFact it is aware of concerns on the use of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of fever for people with COVID-19 but ""after a rapid review of the literature, WHO is not aware of published clinical or population-based data on this topic.""

""We are consulting with physicians treating COVID-19 patients and are not aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known side effects that limit its use in certain populations. Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen.""

Here’s why there is some concern: Some medical professionals believe that the medicine’s anti-inflammatory properties could dampen the body’s immune response.

A March 11 letter in The Lancet medical journal discussed the risk of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension and diabetes. It states that the virus binds to so-called ACE2 receptors on the surfaces of cells and that some anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen helps stimulate those cells. So, the letter theorizes that these medications may, in turn, worsen COVID-19.

But medical experts say this is just theory.

Anecdotes underscore need for research

Some anecdotal stories about experiences with the drug and COVID-19 have also received attention. Health experts say there isn’t enough research to make a sole determination.

Some medical organizations recommend using caution and suggest refraining from use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen until more studies are done.

While acknowledging there’s no evidence ibuprofen can make coronavirus worse, England's National Health Service is one of the organizations that is recommending people err on the side of caution.

""Until we have more info, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you,"" NHS wrote in a tweet on March 18.

With the current coronavirus being so new, there is not enough credible information to say for sure whether ibuprofen can negatively impact patients with coronavirus. Right now, people should remain skeptical about sweeping statements that make bold claims about the medicine and the virus."

Other approaches may show more promise.

• The current downturn is hitting much faster, and social distancing has the potential to impact broader swaths of the economy. But there’s hope that once the pandemic ends, pent-up demand could push a quicker recovery.

• Trouble in the housing and finance sectors caused the 2008 recession. By contrast, the current downturn has a far more unusual source: a pandemic.

With the rising likelihood of a recession caused by the coronavirus outbreak, lawmakers have begun talking about remedies that will sound familiar to anyone who lived through the Great Recession of 2008: stimulus checks, assistance to hard-hit businesses, and moves by the Federal Reserve.

But economists say the upcoming recession is actually quite different from the Great Recession — and that will have consequences for the policy response.

Some of the old remedies are already in the works. But other approaches may be necessary due to the unusual nature of the coronavirus outbreak.

Here, we’ll examine the differences between 2008 and 2020 and consider what those differences mean about how best to ease the nation’s economic pain.

What are the differences between the 2008 and 2020 recessions?

There are more differences between the two recessions than similarities. ""The current situation is radically different,"" said Daniel Mitchell, a libertarian economist.

The 2008 recession ""was caused by a lack of demand, pure and simple,"" said Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""The crash of the housing bubble sent construction plummeting.""

By contrast, the current crisis was not caused by pre-existing economic weakness.

""There was little evidence of an approaching downturn as recently as a month or two ago,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ""Unemployment remained low, job growth was reasonably steady, inflation was moderate, the Federal Reserve had taken no recent steps to curb U.S. economic growth to avert wage or price inflation. Consumer confidence was reasonably high, and there was little sign of financial distress either among U.S. businesses or households.""

Instead, the impending recession stems from a health problem and the fear of contagion.

This is an important distinction for several reasons:

• It’s a rare cause for a recession, so there’s no ready game plan. The last time this happened may have been the recession that followed the Spanish flu of 1918. But the times then were very different, both in terms of the economy and in terms of medical knowledge and technology. So there is no ready model for policymakers to follow.

• The contraction is poised to happen with unusual speed. A slowdown in residential investment began in late 2005, even though the economy would not enter recession until late 2007, said Steve Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis. ""In the current crisis, the shutdown of big parts of the economy looks like it will happen over just a few weeks.""

The sudden shift from ordinary economic activity to measures to preserve public safety ""sounds more like a war than a conventional recession,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist.

• Social distancing is having a unique effect on the economy. The response to the coronavirus has been to keep people physically apart, which makes it difficult if not impossible to spend money as before, at everything from shops to restaurants to theaters to travel-related industries.

This reality will leave long-lasting effects on the economy. Collectively, ""the consumer behavior and policy decisions are likely to produce a decline in GDP that may very well last 2 calendar quarters or longer,"" Burtless said.

• The current downturn has the potential to be temporary. There’s still deep uncertainty about how quickly the pandemic will pass, especially if second and third waves of infections emerge, requiring future rounds of social distancing. But once the epidemic passes, there will be pent-up demand..

""If we can borrow from the future and put off production from today while keeping income flowing, then we could be in a position to see quite a quick return to our old economic lives,"" Sinclair said.

This offers hope for a better scenario than what played out after the Great Recession.

""The lost borrowing and spending after 2009 did not come back at anything like the same rate as in the years before 2007, especially in residential construction,"" Fazzari said. ""In the current crisis, once the virus infections hopefully relent, people will want to travel and go to restaurants and bars. If the virus infections subside in a couple of months, most households will likely be able to afford to resume more or less normal life, and the economy can bounce back.""

• More businesses in more economic sectors may fail than they did during the 2008 recession. While the Great Recession had broad economic impact, ""no sector of the economy had to completely shut down,"" Fazzari said. ""Fewer people went to restaurants in the Great Recession, but much of the restaurant business remained.""

The current crisis, however, has left these types of businesses with no customers.

• We could see supply-side interruptions. During the Great Recession, goods moved freely. If someone was ready to buy a product or service, companies were able to meet that demand.

In the coronavirus crisis, however, some production may be shut down because employees are not able to come to work.

""This kind of thing is largely unprecedented,"" Fazzari said. ""It is a downside risk factor that could magnify both the severity and the persistence of the current crisis.""

This is especially problematic for international supply chains, which may be affected by curbs in transportation and entry.

• This could be a more transformative recession for the economy than 2008. Expect change. Some might be positive, such as people being exposed to working at home finding that they like it, which could support advances in telework that could mean new revenue for technological suppliers.

The need to impose social distancing could also enforce far-reaching changes on the way goods and services are distributed, such as the flow of groceries.

""Right now, grocery stores are missing many crucial items, such as milk, bread, potatoes, and basic medical supplies that consumers are now forced to find by visiting two or more retail outlets, sometimes without success,"" Burtless said. ""My understanding is that there is no genuine shortage of most of these items, either nationally or regionally. But a more orderly way of distributing and rationing access to groceries and medical items would ensure that more consumers would end up with some amount of most of the needed items, with fewer face-to-face interactions with retail clerks and fellow consumers.""

How do these differences affect the economic solutions?

The economists we interviewed offered these ideas for responding to the coronavirus crisis.

• Short-term payments. We found widespread support among economists for cash payments to people and businesses, though also a clear-eyed understanding of the limits of that approach.

""I don’t think universal payments and/or business loans will prevent short-term economic harm, but if the federal government is going to do something, then payments and loans at least address a real problem — the temporary loss of income — with a plausible action, the temporary provision of cash,"" said Mitchell, the libertarian economist.

At the same time, payments of this sort won’t be an economic cure-all. In a conventional recession, handing out stimulus money helps people spend quickly. But there are limits to how effective giving out cash can be at a time when people are required to stay in their houses most of the time. Unlike in a conventional recession, stimulus checks probably won’t help restaurants, bars, theaters, and vacation destinations stay afloat.

""If travel, entertainment, restaurants, and discretionary shopping are off the table for higher-income families, any extra cash they receive is likely to be saved, not spent,"" Fazzari said. ""The need to focus stimulus on the lower part of the income distribution is especially important in this crisis.""

• Loans or other assistance to businesses. These payments could be aimed broadly, or at certain sectors that are particularly hard hit. ""There are powerful reasons to keep many of these otherwise-profitable businesses afloat during the emergency, through extensions of government credit or, as a last resort, government grants, possibly calculated as a percentage of targeted companies’ past payrolls,"" Burtless said.

If businesses get aid, experts said, it needs to be targeted for the benefit of workers, rather than executives. ""We want to make sure the jobs are there when workers are ready to go back,"" Sinclair said.

• Federal Reserve moves. The Federal Reserve can use several levers in a crisis. (We go into greater detail on those levers here; they include signaling about future interest rates, asset purchases, and helping financial institutions with loans or guarantees.) ""I think it is important that the Fed has taken action early,"" Sinclair said. ""They were making sure banks remained solvent, that they had liquidity.""

• Forward-looking policy proposals. Some government efforts may be designed to be implemented over the longer term. Congress approved a modified version of paid family leave, for instance, in its first response to the coronavirus crisis. A more complete version could be implemented later, as could infrastructure spending.

• Pausing all payments for mortgages, rents, and utilities. This is now being tried in hard-hit European countries and is under consideration in the United States. This puts the economy into a temporary deep freeze, with American families hunkering down with reduced income but also reduced obligations.

For most people, the cost of housing and utilities makes up a significant share of their disposable income. If what they owe drops significantly, then the financial pressure from getting laid off declines, particularly if the unusual nature of this recession means that the economy is able to return to something approaching normal fairly quickly."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/mar/19/donald-trump-calls-coronavirus-chinese-virus-healt/,2020-03-19T00:00:00,Donald Trump calls the coronavirus the ‘Chinese virus.’ Health experts say that’s wrong,"The term can also hold back individuals from seeking medical care out of fear of being stigmatized.

The stigma from the term can have a long-lasting effect.

Experts say the phrase “Chinese virus” could foster discrimination toward people of Chinese or Asian origin.

The way President Donald Trump sees it, there’s nothing wrong with calling the new coronavirus the ""Chinese virus."" But the World Health Organization, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other health experts say that phrasing is wrong.

Reporters during White House briefings on the coronavirus have asked Trump why he uses that phrase even when critics say it creates a stigma and is racist.

Trump at a March 17 briefing suggested he was using the term in reaction to moves from China that he didn’t like.

""Well, China was putting out information which was false, that our military gave this to them,"" Trump said. ""That was false, and rather than having an argument, I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So, I think it’s a very accurate term. But no, I didn’t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them. Our military did not give it to anybody.""

Trump said he didn’t think his preferred phrase created a stigma. ""I think saying that our military gave it to them creates a stigma.""

On March 18, Trump again defended his phrasing after a reporter said there had been dozens of incidents of bias against Chinese Americans in the United States, and that the U.S. Health and Human Services secretary said ethnicity does not cause the novel coronavirus.

""It’s not racist at all, no, not at all,"" Trump said. ""It comes from China. That’s why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.""

Trump added that ""China tried to say at one point, maybe they stopped now"" that the coronavirus was caused by American soldiers.

A spokesman for China’s foreign ministry on March 12 suggested, without providing evidence, that the United States was to blame for the coronavirus in China. ""It might be U.S. army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,"" Zhao Lijian tweeted.

The World Health Organization has said that an outbreak of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus, began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It has not linked it to U.S. troops. China’s initial response to the outbreak has been criticized as slow and secretive.

Still, applying the word ""Chinese"" to a virus that’s now all around the world, that has upended daily life worldwide, and fueled global anxiety and fear is problematic and stigmatizes Chinese individuals, experts told PolitiFact.

""We want to keep the focus on the virus, not on ethnicity or racial differences,"" said Natalia Molina, a professor of American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California. ""We want to keep the focus on prevention, not increase an us-them divide.""

At a March 10 House hearing, Rep. Lois Frankel, D-Fla., asked CDC director Robert Redfield whether he agreed that calling the coronavirus the ""Chinese coronavirus"" was ""absolutely wrong and inappropriate.""

""Yes,"" Redfield said.

Neither the White House nor Trump’s re-election campaign provided an on-the-record response for PolitiFact’s story.

Impact of using a geographic term for the virus

Geographic terms have been adopted in the past for diseases, such as the Spanish flu and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. And Trump isn’t the only one to have used the phrase ""Chinese virus.""

A Twitter account managed by Trump’s re-election campaign tweeted a 38-second video compiling instances when cable TV news reporters — on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC — used the term ""Chinese coronavirus,"" ""Wuhan coronavirus"" or ""Chinese virus"" when reporting on the outbreak. (PolitiFact used the phrase ""Wuhan coronavirus"" in headlines of two January fact-checks.)

The March 12 Trump campaign tweet claimed Trump was accused of ""racism and xenophobia for stating the facts.""

""This is a foreign virus that originated in Wuhan, China. Just a few weeks ago, Democrats and the media were all saying it!"" the tweet said.

But experts say it’s best to not name diseases after geographic places.

WHO in 2015 issued best practices guidance for the naming of new human infectious diseases, with the aim of minimizing ""unnecessary negative impact"" on industries and to avoid offending any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups. The guidance said disease names should not include geographic locations, such as cities, countries, regions and continents.

The phrase ""Chinese virus"" could foster discrimination toward people of Chinese or Asian origin, said Elizabeth L. Petrun Sayers, a behavioral and social scientist at RAND Corporation.

Using the geographic term suggests that they may be more susceptible to the virus and more likely to spread COVID-19, Petrun Sayers said.

""These types of assumptions are incorrect, because viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups, and have implications for shaping the general public’s attitudes towards persons of Asian origin,"" Petrun Sayers said.

The stigma can have a long-lasting effect.

Research about severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, says that residents in Hong Kong, near the center of the 2003 outbreak, experienced shunning, insults and exclusion from professional and social circles, Petrun Sayers said. ""Discrimination creates undeserved distress for those affected or believed to be affected and can severely decrease their quality of life,"" she said.

The term can also hold back individuals from seeking medical care out of fear of being stigmatized, Molina said. ""They will be less likely to seek medical care, which undermines all of our public health,"" she said.

Molina said it’s important to keep in mind how rhetoric affects people.

""At a time when we are worried about how social isolation is affecting us,"" she said. ""We need to understand that racial animus is only going to make things worse for those groups."""

The Republican National Committee on Friday in a tweet distributed a clip of Fauci, the longtime head of the National Institutes of Health unit for infectious diseases, echoing Trump’s rhetoric. The RNC framed Fauci’s comments this way: “Dr. Fauci responds to question about differences between U.S. and Italy, says @realDonaldTrump stopping travel very early from China ‘has gone a long way’ in fight against coronavirus.”

Indeed, in the interview, Fauci suggested that a big difference between the United States and Italy, where the death toll has soared above 3,000, is that Italy did not shut down travel from China. “They had an open border, they let people in,” Fauci said.

But that’s simply wrong.

The Facts

On Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency because of the rapid spread of the coronavirus. That same day, Italy confirmed two cases of coronavirus in the country — two Chinese tourists who had landed in Rome some days earlier. The patients were isolated in a hospital in Rome.

Italy’s prime minister took immediate action, declaring a state of emergency and announcing a ban effective Jan. 31 on all flights to and from China to Italy, with no exceptions. He announced this step even though the WHO advisory recommended against travel restrictions. The ban on flights also extended to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. The announcement added that anyone on a flight to Italy would face health checks upon arrival.

AD

AD

Trump’s action was not as quick — or as sweeping.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Jan. 21 announced the first travel-related case of novel coronavirus in the United States. Ten days later, Trump announced travel restrictions on non-U. S. citizens traveling from China, effective Feb. 2, but there were 11 exceptions, and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan were not included. U.S. citizens could still travel from China but were subject to screening and possible 14-day quarantine. Some flights were immediately suspended, but others continued for weeks, at the discretion of the airlines.

“We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,” Trump claimed in a Feb. 2 interview with Fox’s Sean Hannity. The virus was already spreading through the United States. But the testing criteria set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were extremely narrow: Only those with recent travel to China or those who had come into contact with a confirmed infection would be tested.

AD

AD

Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, six weeks later. Only two days earlier, Trump had barred non-U. S. citizens from coming to the United States from 26 countries in Europe, later extended to include the United Kingdom and Ireland. Only in recent days have border crossings been restricted with immediate neighbors of the United States — Canada and Mexico.

In sum, Italy took action one day after discovering the first cases and banned all flights between China and Italy, including territories related to China. Trump took action 10 days after the first case and did not ban flights, just non-U. S. citizens with an array of exceptions.

Liz Harrington, the RNC spokeswoman, tweeted in response to our questioning of Fauci’s statement that the European Union still kept its borders open, suggesting Chinese tourists could still visit Italy via alternative routes. (On Jan. 26, China had canceled all domestic and international group tours.)

AD

AD

A spokesman for NIAID said: “In the NBC interview, Dr. Fauci was not only referring to travel from China to Italy but travel generally from the rest of Europe to Italy.”

Remember: the RNC tweet cast it as praise for Trump’s “very early” action against China.

In any case, despite the Italian government’s fast action, health officials now believe the virus has been circulating for weeks unnoticed in northern Italy, probably since mid-January. So the horse was already out of the barn by the time the flights were halted. Northern Italy became the epicenter of the deadly outbreak in the country.

The Pinocchio Test

Fauci has had long experience in this field and is widely respected. But his framing in the interview is misleading. Italy took faster and more sweeping steps than the United States, and yet still got slammed by the virus. Italy’s borders with the rest of Europe did remain open, but the U.S. borders with Europe were open for many more weeks as well — as Trump repeatedly played down the seriousness of the pandemic.

DETROIT (AP) — President Donald Trump is falsely asserting how quickly automakers including GM, Ford and Tesla can manufacture ventilators to help fill an acute U.S. shortage of the medical equipment for coronavirus patients.

Ford and GM have yet to start production, and it would take them months, if not longer, to begin production, if it's even possible.

A look at the claim:

TRUMP: “Ford, General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products, FAST! @fema Go for it auto execs, lets see how good you are?” — tweet Sunday.

TRUMP, on addressing a shortage of ventilators: “General Motors, Ford, so many companies — I had three calls yesterday directly, without having to institute like: `You will do this’ — these companies are making them right now.” — briefing Saturday.

THE FACTS: No automaker is anywhere close to making medical gear such as ventilators and remain months away — if not longer. Nor do the car companies need the president’s permission to move forward.

Neither GM or Ford is building ventilators at present, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Friday that his company was “working on ventilators"" but he didn’t specify how long it might take. His tweets also questioned the need and said it couldn't be done immediately.

Unless automakers can move with unprecedented speed, redirecting plants to make completely different products will take a long time — possibly too long to help with medical gear shortages.

“When you are repurposing a factory, it really depends on how similar the new product is to the existing products in your product line,” said Kaitlin Wowak, a professor at the University of Notre Dame who focuses on industrial supply chains. “It’s going to be a substantial pivot to start producing an entirely different item.”

GM announced on Friday that it is working with ventilator maker Ventec Life Systems to ramp up production. The automaker said it would help with logistics, purchasing and manufacturing, but stopped short of saying it would make ventilators in its own factories, which have been idled for two weeks after workers who'd been fearful of the contagion put pressure on the company.

Any manufacturing at GM would come much later. GM does have a lot of 3D printers and could make parts and other things to help, but it does not need permission from Trump. In fact, GM manufacturing engineers were at Ventec late last week working on this, well before Trump's tweet.

Ford, which also suspended factory production along with other automakers with operations in North America, confirmed that it too was in discussions with the Trump administration about helping, but had not started.

“We’re looking at feasibility,” Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said. “It may be possible, but it’s not you go from Rangers (small pickups) one day to ventilators the next. We’re figuring out what is possible now.”

Trump said last week that he invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act, which allows the government to marshal the private sector to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. But he did not give examples as to how he was using it.

On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, indicated that Trump had not used the act to trigger production of medical equipment.

“What the president was saying is that these companies are coming forth on their own,” Fauci told CBS' “Face the Nation.”

The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Peter Gaynor, agreed. “I think it's an insurance policy. Right? It's a lever. If we have to throw that lever we will,"" he said on NBC's “Meet the Press.”

https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/21/politics/fact-check-joe-biden-gun-control/index.html,2020-03-21T00:00:00,Fact-checking Joe Biden's recent comments on gun control,"(CNN) Former Vice President Joe Biden , who's the current front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary, made several gun-related claims recently during an argument with an auto worker and during a tele-townhall this week. We took a look at some of those claims to see what the facts were.

Gun rights

During a campaign stop at a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant on March 10, Biden was accused by one of the workers of wanting to take away people's guns.

""You are actively trying to end our Second Amendment right and take away our guns,"" one man accused Biden.

""You're full of sh**,"" Biden snapped back. ""I did not—no, no, shush. Shush. I support the Second Amendment.""

Later, the man again accused Biden of saying he would take away guns in the US. ""You were with Beto when he said he was going to take our guns.""

To which, Biden replied, ""I did not say that. That's not true. I did not say that.""

Facts First: Biden's gun control plan does not include confiscating legally owned weapons and an interpretation of a ""viral video"" is a mishearing of what was said. The former vice president has said in the past that a Biden administration would come for people's ""assault weapons.""

Biden's gun control plan outlines a buyback program for ""assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,"" but the program is not a mandatory buyback and would not force people to give their up their guns.

According to Biden's website, the buyback program ""will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act.""

But in August 2019, during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Biden was asked about people who think a Biden administration ""means they're going to come for my guns."" Biden replied, ""Bingo, you're right if you have an assault weapon. The fact of the matter is they should be illegal. Period.""

When asked about this exchange, a Biden official told CNN, ""Joe Biden defeated the NRA to ban assault weapons before, and he was reminding viewers that as president he will do it again.""

The auto worker's reference to a video of Biden and former Congressman Beto O'Rourke likely refers to one of Biden talking with O'Rourke and his wife in a restaurant in Texas.

When talking about how O'Rourke has championed certain progressive issues, Biden said ""this guy (O'Rourke) can change the face of what we're dealing with. With regard to guns -- assault weapons -- with regard to dealing with climate change.""

""And I just want to warn Amy (O'Rourke's wife), if I win, I'm coming for him,"" Biden said, referring and pointing to O'Rourke, who has supported confiscating assault rifles from US citizens Some have mistakenly said that Biden was claiming he would come for US citizen's guns, not O'Rourke, but Biden is talking about coming for ""him"" (O'Rourke) not ""'em"" (i.e. guns).

Smart guns

During the tele-town hall Monday, Biden was asked a question on guns and the Second Amendment and in his response, Biden talked about what are often called ""smart guns"" some of which require a fingerprint to fire.

Biden claimed that in response to smart gun tech ""the NRA and the gun manufactures came along and said 'if you keep selling them, we're going to put you out of business.'""

Facts First: The National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association for firearm manufacturers, told CNN they do not oppose smart guns but do oppose mandates of the technology.

Amy Hunter, director of media relations for the NRA, told CNN in a statement that ""Biden is wrong"" and that the NRA simply opposes government mandates for smart guns.

""He should check his facts before opening his mouth,"" Hunter said. ""The NRA does not oppose smart gun technology. The NRA is opposed to government mandates that require consumers to only buy smart guns. That's why we oppose any law that mandates when smart gun technology became available, all traditional firearms would become illegal.""

One aspect of Biden's gun safety plan is to ""put America on the path to ensuring that 100% of firearms sold in America are smart guns"" and says ""Biden believes we should work to eventually require that 100% of firearms sold in the US are smart guns.""

Mark Oliva, director of public affairs at NSSF, told CNN regarding Biden's statement about smart gun tech that ""the bottom line is this is categorically false. The industry has never made such a statement.""

""We represent the gun manufacturers,"" Oliva said, ""we have never opposed the technology, we have only opposed the mandate with the technology."" Oliva also said the technology was not ready and that ""no police departments have adopted this technology because it just doesn't work.

One issue facing ""smart guns"" is the New Jersey Childproof Handgun law which was passed in 2002. That New Jersey law mandates that once what the law calls ""personalized"" (i.e. smart) guns are available in the US, all handguns sold in New Jersey must be such ""personalized"" guns.

Biofire, one of the companies working on smart gun technology, says on its website that ""the New Jersey mandate is a major roadblock to smart guns, and has been since it was passed 20 years ago.""

Machine guns

Biden, arguing that the Second Amendment does not give everyone the right to own any firearm or weapon they want, said during the town hall that ""you're not allowed to own, for example, a machine gun in the United States of America.""

Facts First: Older machine guns, or fully automatics, can be purchased in the US, but there are many regulations which make it difficult to do so.

Private citizens who want to purchase a fully automatic weapon must buy it from someone with a Federal Firearms License -- which is necessary, among other things, to manufacture ammo and firearms and sell them as a major source of income. The gun must have been made and registered with the US government prior to May 19, 1986.

To transfer/purchase one of these machine guns there is transfer tax of $200 and the FFL holder must submit a form to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives which includes information about the gun as well as the transferee's personal information, photo, fingerprints, and answers to questions to determine if the purchaser can legally possess the firearm.

The ATF will then review the form to determine if the transfer is legal and ""will not approve the form if the transfer, receipt, or possession of the firearm would place the transferee in violation of any Federal, State, or local law."" Only when the ATF approves the transfer — checking state and local laws that govern fully automatic weapons — can the gun be purchased."

President Trump has made a lot of promises about actions that his administration is taking to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

Not all of them have been exactly on the mark — and some have yet to pay off as advertised.

Naval hospital ships

The president announced on Wednesday that the Navy would dispatch its two hospital ships, the USNS Comfort and the USNS Mercy, to help treat patients and free up land-based hospitals for coronavirus patients.

""So those two ships are being prepared to go, and they can be launched over the next week or so,"" Trump said, calling the ships in ""tip-top shape.""

Well, not so much.

The Navy said that the Comfort was actually undergoing repairs in Norfolk, Va., and it would be weeks before it would be ready to sail to New York. And the Mercy, based in San Diego, would take several days before it was staffed with doctors and nurses and be ready for deployment somewhere on the West Coast.

Although the deployments may still go ahead, the ships likely won't sail right away.

FDA drug approval

On Thursday, Trump touted that the Food and Drug Administration had ""approved"" use of an anti-malaria drug called chloroquine to treat patients afflicted with the coronavirus.

The president sounded excited.

""We're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,"" Trump said, calling it ""a tremendous breakthrough"" and a potential ""game-changer.""

But FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn tried to tamp down Trump's enthusiasm, saying that ""a large, pragmatic clinical trial"" would be needed first to determine the drug's usefulness before making it available to coronavirus patients.

Hahn said he couldn't ""speculate about a timeline"" for the drug's availability.

Trump's enthusiasm for hydroxychloroquine spilled into another press conference on Friday, when he again described it as a potential wonder drug.

And again, a public health official — this time, Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top immunologist on the White House's response team — tried to rein in the optimism by echoing the need for clinical proof that it would make a difference.

On Thursday, Trump said another drug, Remdesivir, had ""also been approved, or very close to approved"" by the FDA for treating patients coronavirus. In fact, that drug is undergoing a clinical trial and is months away from being ready for use.

The website

Last Friday, Trump said at a Rose Garden news conference that Google has 1,700 engineers developing a new website that would help Americans determine whether they should seek testing for the coronavirus.

The president sought to cast his own project as a triumph compared with the initial failure of President Barack Obama to roll out a website as part of the changes to the health care market enacted in 2009.

""Google is helping to develop a website,"" Trump said. ""It's going to be very quickly done — unlike websites of the past — to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.""

Within hours, Google attempted to clarify the president's comments. It said an affiliated company, Verily, was working on the project but on a limited scale only for people in the San Francisco area.

""Verily is in the early stages of development,"" Google said, ""and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time.""

The website is now functional in ""select counties in the Bay area.""

Medical supplies

On Wednesday, Trump met with a group of nurses at the White House, telling them that the administration had arranged for a major new supply of the type of respirator in high demand during the pandemic.

""We've ordered 500 million N95 masks to drive private production,"" Trump said. He also said that construction companies were being asked to donate unused masks. The next day at a briefing, Vice President Pence stated: ""We've vastly increased the supply of medical masks.""

But hospitals continue to report that they are running short of masks, as are pharmacists. Authorities are taking donations from unlikely sources, including financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs.

Loose-fitting surgical masks aren't appropriate for dealing with the pandemic authorities say; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a graphic detailing the important differences between a surgical mask and an N95 respirator.

Trump acknowledged the shortfall in supplies on Friday when he said he had invoked the Cold War-era Defense Production Act, which permits him to direct production of essential items.

""We are using it,"" Trump said, ""for certain things that we need,"" citing ventilators and masks.

It still isn't clear how much equipment is needed to respond to current and future patients in the pandemic beyond what's in hand today and when or whether the demand will be met.

Testing

One of the most frequent exaggerations coming from the administration is the availability of coronavirus tests.

When he visited the CDC in Atlanta earlier this month, Trump claimed that ""They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful. Anybody that needs a test gets a test.""

Pence made a similar claim last week, saying that ""a million tests are in the field"" and that ""by the end of this week, another 4 million tests will be distributed.""

Even so, anecdotal reports abound about Americans who feel sick struggling to be able to confirm a diagnosis with an actual test. Fauci acknowledged that there clearly is a gap between the supply and the demand.

At the same time, he echoed assurances by Trump and Pence that the situation is improving.

""I get the same calls that many of you get ... for one reason or another they can't get [tests],"" Fauci said on Friday. ""That is a reality that is happening now. Is it the same as it was a few weeks ago? Absolutely not.""

The anecdotal nature of the accounts means it's difficult to assess what the spread might be between the testing capacity available now, or set to come onstream soon, and the pool of people who satisfy the administration's guidelines to request one.

Trump and Pence say they don't want every American — particularly those who are feeling well — to be tested. It still isn't clear, however, how big the gap remains between requests for tests considered valid under Trump's and Pence's conditions — and the capacity to support them."

Our core principles are independence, transparency, fairness, thorough reporting and clear writing. The reason we publish is to give citizens the information they need to govern themselves in a democracy.

Since our launch in 2007, we’ve received many questions about how we choose facts to check, how we stay nonpartisan, how we go about fact-checking and other topics. This document attempts to answer those questions and many more.

How PolitiFact started

PolitiFact started in 2007 as an election-year project of the Tampa Bay Times (then named the St. Petersburg Times), Florida’s largest daily newspaper.

From the beginning, PolitiFact focused on looking at specific statements made by politicians and rating them for accuracy. PolitiFact is run by the editors and journalists who make up the PolitiFact team. No one tells us what to write about or how to rate statements. We do so independently, using our news judgment.

Our ownership

PolitiFact is owned by the nonprofit Poynter Institute for Media Studies. PolitiFact had been owned by the Tampa Bay Times, but in 2018 direct ownership of PolitiFact was transferred from the Times to Poynter, which is the newspaper’s parent company. The move allows PolitiFact to function fully as not-for-profit national news organization.

The ties between the Poynter Institute and the Tampa Bay Times go back decades. The longtime owner of the Times was Nelson Poynter, whose father had bought the newspaper in 1912. Poynter championed independent journalism and wanted to ensure that the newspaper remain locally owned and protected from chain ownership. So upon his death in 1978, he left the newspaper not to his heirs, but to the school for journalists that now bears his name.

Nelson Poynter was also the founder of Congressional Quarterly, a news organization covering Congress in Washington, D.C., that the Poynter Institute owned until 2009. PolitiFact now continues the Poynter Institute’s historical connection to Washington-based political journalism.

Control of both the the Poynter Institute and the Tampa Bay Times lies with a single executive. Upon retirement, that leader picks a successor. Poynter himself picked Eugene Patterson, who picked Andrew Barnes, who picked the Times' current chairman and CEO, Paul Tash, a lifelong journalist.

Our partner websites

PolitiFact has several companion websites. PolitiFact runs PunditFact, a site devoted to fact-checking talking heads, as well as PolitiFact Florida, aimed at state-level fact-checking. Other PolitiFact state sites are run by news organizations that have partnered with PolitiFact. The state sites follow the same principles as the national site.

Some of our current partners are newspapers, such as the Austin American-Statesman (part of GateHouse Media); and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (part of Gannett Co. Inc.). Our partners also include Capital Public Radio based in Sacramento, Calif., and VTdigger.org, an independent Vermont-based news website.

Our funding

In the years following our start, PolitiFact relied primarily on financial support from the Tampa Bay Times newspaper. Today, we receive support from revenue generated through content partnerships, online advertising and grants. In 2017, PolitiFact launched a membership campaign called the Truth Squad to allow donations from readers and fans of fact-checking.

PolitiFact discloses any individual donation or grant in excess of $1,000. We also disclose organizations that contributed more than 5 percent of total PolitiFact revenues in the previous calendar year. (See the list.) PolitiFact does not accept donations from anonymous sources, political parties, elected officials or candidates seeking public office, or any other source we would consider a conflict of interest.

PolitiFact does not give donors, advertisers or grantmakers any influence over content or ratings. Our contracts and grant agreements have clauses asserting our editorial independence.

Decisions on coverage, what facts to check, and Truth-O-Meter ratings are determined solely by PolitiFact’s independent journalists.

Our ethics policy for PolitiFact journalists

PolitiFact seeks to present the true facts, unaffected by agenda or biases. Our journalists set their own opinions aside as they work to uphold principles of independence and fairness. (See a list of our current journalists and their biographies.)

As part of that effort, PolitiFact journalists avoid the public expression of political opinion and public involvement in the political process.

We don’t make political contributions or work on campaigns. We don’t sign online petitions, post yard signs, or participate in political marches.

We avoid expressing political views on social media. We do share news stories and other journalism, but we take care not to be seen as endorsing or opposing a political figure or position. We avoid snarky commentary.

We may participate in the political process as voters, because we also have responsibilities as individual citizens of the United States. But we keep our votes to ourselves as a matter of principle. Our goal is to be open-minded in all of our work.

This policy applies to full-time staffers, correspondents and interns. We avoid doing anything that compromises PolitiFact or our ability to do our jobs with independence and fairness.

How we choose claims to fact-check

Each day, PolitiFact journalists look for statements to fact-check. We read transcripts, speeches, news stories, press releases, and campaign brochures. We watch TV and scan social media. Readers send us suggestions via email to [email protected]; we often fact-check statements submitted by readers. Because we can't feasibly check all claims, we select the most newsworthy and significant ones.

In deciding which statements to check, we consider these questions:

• Is the statement rooted in a fact that is verifiable? We don’t check opinions, and we recognize that in the world of speechmaking and political rhetoric, there is license for hyperbole.

• Does the statement seem misleading or sound wrong?

• Is the statement significant? We avoid minor ""gotchas"" on claims that are obviously a slip of the tongue.

• Is the statement likely to be passed on and repeated by others?

• Would a typical person hear or read the statement and wonder: Is that true?

We select statements about topics that are in the news. Without keeping count, we try to select facts to check from both Democrats and Republicans. At the same time, we more often fact-check the party that holds power or people who repeatedly make attention-getting or misleading statements.

Our on-the-record sourcing

PolitiFact uses on-the-record interviews and publishes a list of sources with every fact-check. When possible, the list includes links to sources that are freely available, although some sources rely on paid subscriptions. The goal is to help readers judge for themselves whether they agree with the ruling.

We always contact or attempt to contact the person, website or organization that made the statement we are fact-checking.

Every fact-check is different, but generally speaking our reporting process includes the following: a review of what other fact-checkers have found previously; a thorough Google search; a search of online databases; consultation with a variety of experts; a review of publications and a final overall review of available evidence.

We emphasize primary sources and original documentation. We seek direct access to government reports, academic studies and other data. It’s not sufficient for us to get something second-hand. We don’t rely on what a campaign or elected official tells us -- we verify it independently.

In cases where PolitiFact must cite news reports from other media that rely on unnamed or unattributed sources (usually due to the extreme newsworthiness of the report), we note that we cannot independently verify their reporting.

How we determine Truth-O-Meter ratings

The goal of the Truth-O-Meter is to reflect the relative accuracy of a statement. The meter has six ratings, in decreasing level of truthfulness:

TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

The burden of proof is on the speaker, and we rate statements based on the information known at the time the statement is made.

The reporter who researches and writes the fact-check suggests a rating when they turn in the report to an assigning editor. The editor and reporter review the report together, typically making clarifications and adding additional details. They come to agreement on the rating. Then, the assigning editor brings the rated fact-check to two additional editors.

The three editors and reporter then review the fact-check by discussing the following questions.

• Is the statement literally true?

• Is there another way to read the statement? Is the statement open to interpretation?

• Did the speaker provide evidence? Did the speaker prove the statement to be true?

• How have we handled similar statements in the past? What is PolitiFact’s jurisprudence?

The three editors then vote on the rating (two votes carry the decision), sometimes leaving it as the reporter suggested and sometimes changing it to a different rating. More edits are made; the report is then published.

How we determine Flip-O-Meter ratings

The Flip-O-Meter rates an official's consistency on an issue. The rating is not making a value judgment about a politician who changes positions on an issue. Some voters appreciate politicians who are flexible and have the ability to compromise or adapt their positions to the wishes of their voters.

Still, accusations of shifting positions are common in politics, and we’ve found that an analysis of the shift and the degree of change can be informative.

The Flip-O-Meter has three ratings:

NO FLIP – No significant change in position.

HALF FLIP – A partial change in position.

FULL FLOP – A complete change in position.

The writing, editing and rating process for Flip-O-Meter reports is similar to the process for Truth-O-Meter fact-checks.

How we track campaign promises

PolitiFact tracks campaign promises in order to inform readers how well elected officials carry out their agenda. We rate campaign promises based on verifiable outcomes, not on intentions or effort.

To create our promise meters, such as the Trump-O-Meter, we pore through speech transcripts, TV appearances, position papers and campaign websites looking for promises.

We define a promise as a prospective statement of an action or outcome that is verifiable. All of our promises list the source.

The promise meters have six ratings. The first three provide a broad picture of whether the official is making progress; the final three indicate whether he or she kept the promise.

NOT YET RATED — Every promise begins at this level and retains this rating until we see evidence of progress — or evidence that the promise has stalled.

IN THE WORKS — This indicates the promise has been proposed or is being considered.

STALLED — There is no movement on the promise, perhaps because of limitations on money, opposition from lawmakers or a shift in priorities.

COMPROMISE — Promises earn this rating when they accomplish substantially less than the official’s original statement but when there is still a significant accomplishment that is consistent with the goal of his original promise.

PROMISE KEPT — Promises earn this rating when the original promise is mostly or completely fulfilled.

PROMISE BROKEN – The promise has not been fulfilled. This could occur because of inaction by the executive or lack of support from the legislative branch or other group that was critical for the promise to be fulfilled. A Promise Broken rating does not necessarily mean that the executive failed to advocate for the policy.

Promise ratings change when circumstances change. For some promises, it's possible that the status could initially go to In the Works, but then move back to Stalled if we decide the proposal has hit a lull, and then go back to the In the Works. Similarly, a promise could be rated Promise Kept, but if the official reversed course, the promise would then be rated Promise Broken.

How we correct our mistakes

Mistakes happen. PolitiFact corrects errors as quickly as possible and with appropriate transparency.

Major errors of fact – A serious error that results in a new rating or otherwise changes the general outlook of the fact-check receives a mark of correction at the top of the fact-check.

The text of the fact-check is updated with the new information, and an archived copy of the previous fact-check is preserved and linked to. Additionally, the link text for the item is marked as updated. Corrected fact-checks receive a tag of ""Corrections and updates.""

Errors of fact – Errors of fact that do not impact the rating or do not change the general outlook of the fact-check receive a mark of correction at the bottom of the fact-check.

The text of the fact-check is updated with the new information. The correction states the correct information that has been added to the report. If necessary for clarity, it repeats the incorrect information. Corrected fact-checks receive a tag of ""Corrections and updates.""

Typos, grammatical errors, misspellings – We correct typos, grammatical errors, misspellings, transpositions and other small errors without a mark of correction or tag and as soon as they are brought to our attention.

Updates – From time to time, we add additional information to stories and fact-checks after they’ve published, not as a correction but as a service to readers. Examples include a response from the speaker we received after publication (that did not change the conclusion of the report), or breaking news after publication that is relevant to the check. Updates can be made parenthetically within the text with a date, or at the end of the report. Updated fact-checks receive a tag of ""Corrections and updates.""

Explanatory editor’s notes – Sometimes we alert readers to other information that would be helpful, without changing the original report, such as an outpouring of reader response. In those cases, we post an editor’s note, either at the top or the bottom of the report, as appropriate. Editor’s notes are sometimes used on initial publication to explain a special report’s purpose or outlook.

Critics of a bill that would have replaced Missouri marriage licenses with ""contracts of domestic union"" said it was an end-run around the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage.

The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Adam Schnelting, R-St. Charles, said he just wants the government out of the marriage business.

The bill, HB2173, which died in the House Rules Committee on March 5, also would have eliminated the mandate requiring a judge or minister to perform a ceremony solemnizing the marriage. Schnelting does not know whether he will reintroduce the bill in next year's session.

In pushing the changes in a Missouri Times op-ed last month, Schnelting wrote ""HB2173 does not alter state or federal benefits.""

We reached out to Schnelting and asked him how it could be guaranteed that domestic unions, which have no federal definition, could qualify for federal benefits.

Schnelting responded that contracts of domestic union are the legal equivalent of marriage and ""treats everyone equally under the law.""

That’s a big claim. Our research shows it doesn’t pan out.

The legal difference between marriage and domestic unions

Problems begin with the phrase ""domestic union.""

The state and federal governments define marriage as a legal contract between two spouses. That contract opens the door to an expansive list of federal benefits including Social Security, Medicare, joint tax returns and employment benefits.

Schnelting and his bill define a domestic union as the legal equivalent of marriage. But there is no other state that recognizes that term.

So, let’s consider alternatives: Groups that condemn the bill for undermining marriage equality such as the Missouri chapter of The American Civil Liberties Union and PROMO, an LGBTQ advocacy group, have focused on existing terminology of ""domestic partnerships"" and ""civil unions."" Featured Fact-check Says Bill White is for gay marriage.

Both include two individuals who consistently live together and have a personal relationship. These marriage-alternative unions were often utilized by same- sex couples seeking legal benefits prior to the 2015 Supreme Court ruling.

Unlike marriage, civil unions and domestic partnerships are not recognized in all 50 states. They are also not recognized by the federal government and thus are not eligible for most federal benefits.

In states where domestic partnerships and civil unions are recognized, individuals can receive benefits that parallel those of marriage such as healthcare benefits from employers. These benefits differ greatly by state.

Following the Supreme Court ruling, several states including New Hampshire, Delaware and Connecticut converted all civil unions into marriages.

Domestic unions, like civil unions and domestic partnerships, are not recognized under federal law, so eligibility for federal benefits depends on the state.

For example, the United States Social Security Administration’s website states it recognizes ""some"" civil unions and domestic partnerships for determining entitlement to Medicare, Social Security and Social Security Income. However, it recognizes marriages in all states.

The Department of State also does not consider individuals in domestic partnerships or civil unions as spouses for immigration purposes.

Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service does not consider civil unions or domestic partnerships as married for purposes of federal tax benefits. These marriage alternative unions cannot apply for joint tax returns.

So what about state benefits?

We couldn’t find any example of marriage benefits specific to Missouri that would be affected.

Our ruling

Schnelting wrote that replacing marriage licenses with domestic union contracts ""does not alter state or federal benefits.""

While domestic unions could be recognized in Missouri as legally equivalent to marriage, there is no guarantee that the other states would recognize the union, or the dissolution of the union as such. And, with no federal definition, there is also nothing in federal law qualifying domestic unions for the expansive list of spousal benefits, privileges and rights."

Lord Dunmore’s orders happen to be some of them.

Dunmore, Virginia’s royal governor at the time of war, recently had his chance at the limelight when he was compared with Virginia's current Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, on the issue of gun control

State Sen. Eric Burlison, R-Springfield, tweeted: ""Anyone who knows Virginia history can see the comparison with Lord Dunmore and @GovernorVA Ralph Northam. Remember, the American Revolution began when they came for the guns. #2ndAmendment""

Burlison tweeted this the day of a gun rally in Virginia.

More than 22,000 people rallied outside the state Capitol on Jan. 20 in protest of gun control legislation Northam supported. Northam supported a bill that called for the ban of certain assault rifles, but it failed in the state Senate on Feb. 17. Other bills, ranging from giving local Virginian governments more ability to ban concealed carry in public places to reporting stolen guns, passed on Feb. 28.

We reached out to Burlison’s office. His staff said that the senator did not mean to imply that Dunmore caused the Revolution, so we’re concentrating here on the sentence about guns. They also cited a History.com article as a summary of the war.

Burlison’s tweet seems to simplify an entire revolution. So, we dusted off the history textbooks. Here’s what we found.

What happened

This tweet was meant to call back on American history and use it as a cautionary tale — except the tale was taken out of context.

The first battles of the Revolution were on April 19, 1775, at Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts. The town was alerted before the British arrived. Minutemen stood waiting for them — a shot rang out and the scene became violent.

We know a few things for sure:

Gen.Thomas Gage sent Lt. Colonel Smith to lead the British troops to Concord.

Gage received a tip that colonial soldiers in Concord were gathering arms.

The British troops were ordered to destroy gunpowder and arrest the colonial rebels John Hancock and Samuel Adams.

What else were the troops after? While one said arms weren't targeted, another said that guns would've been part of the order to confiscate the armory at Concord.

A third, University of Missouri history professor John L. Bullion, showed us the written orders. In a letter from Gage to Smith, Gage orders the destruction of guns — and ammunition, flour, tents, pork or beef, carriages and more. But there were more politics in play.

Who was Dunmore, anyway?

We should probably take a look at Lord Dunmore. After all, Burlison mentions him in the first half of the tweet. Featured Fact-check Says of the Milwaukee mass shooter: ""Supposedly he is black. A noose was hung on his locker and he addressed the issue and he was fired! So he returned the next work day and killed who he all thought were involved.""

Lord Dunmore, also known as John Murray, was the last royal governor of Virginia. As tensions grew, Dunmore called for the removal of gunpowder stored in local magazines.

Dunmore was then pressured by the hundreds of countrymen that stormed Williamsburg to either return or pay for the lost gunpowder. Dunmore ended up having to pay 330 pounds (or about $56,000 in today’s dollars).

He became very unpopular and was chased out of his home. Dunmore and his family then had to stay on the British ship Fowley.

However, Dunmore is probably better known for his later 1775 proclamation. It announced that a revolution was underfoot and offered freedom to enslaved people if they fought for the British.

...And taxes?

WIth politics, money usually becomes an issue at one point. That goes for what leads up to the revolution, too.

Britain won the French and Indian War, but the fighting wasn’t cheap. The 1764 Currency Act said the colonies couldn’t print their own money, but what caused the biggest uproar was the Stamp Act of the next year. The tax was on all printed paper — including newspapers, legal documents and more.

That kicked off a building frustration for colonists over taxes without representation in the British Parliament. That’s not all, though — more acts were added that taxed more products. More soldiers occupied colonists’ homes.

And the British Parliament made clear it could make whatever laws it liked.

Things got worse when five colonists died in the Boston Massacre.

Soldiers were convicted of lesser crimes, but not murder. Samuel Adams created committees of correspondence to spread the news about the massacre in 1772.

The following year, some Sons of Liberty members snuck on a tea ship in Boston Harbor. They dumped the tea overboard to protest a monopoly given to the East India Tea Company. Britain retaliated. However, colonists encouraged boycotts, and New England began preparing for war.

In 1775, British soldiers attempted to take some ammunition but were turned away. Later, word got out to the British that the growing rebellion might be storing military supplies in Concord.

One day after the first battles, Lord Dunmore made an order to get rid of gunpowder.

The rest is (literally) history.

Our ruling

Burlison tweeted that ""the American Revolution began when they came for the guns.""

His tweet was a dramatic simplification of history There were many factors at play that sparked the American Revolution. It was caused by a lack of economic freedom and representation in the government and more.

That said, arms may have been one of many factors in the invasion of Lexington and Concord."

On March 10, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt (R) filed a lawsuit against televangelist Jim Bakker and his production company for advertising and marketing a silver solution that he and his guest, Sherill Sellman, falsely implied could cure coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

During the broadcast, naturopathic doctor Sherill Sellman claimed the silver solution had killed other viruses. Coronavirus is a family of viruses. Other notable outbreaks have been SARS and MERS.

""Well, let's say it hasn't been tested on this strain of the coronavirus, but it has been tested on other strains of the coronavirus and has been able to eliminate it within 12 hours,"" Sellman said.

""Totally eliminate it. Kills it. Deactivates it.""

As Sellman spoke, a message appeared on the bottom of the screen advertising the sale of four, 4-ounce bottles of the silver solution for $80.

So, is there any silver solution that kills any strain of coronavirus?

In a word: No.

On March 9, the Food and Drug Administration issued warning statements to seven companies, including the Jim Bakker Show, informing them to stop selling products they claimed cure the coronavirus. The products cited in the letter were teas, essential oils, tinctures and colloidal silver, according to the FDA news release.

This wasn’t the Jim Bakker Show’s first warning. On March 3, New York Attorney General Letitia James’s office sent a cease and desist letter to Bakker for misleading the public about the effectiveness of the silver solution as a cure for the novel disease. We reached out to Sellman to see what actually was in this silver substance, but never got a response.

One ingredient, though, is colloidal silver, a liquid that contains silver particles. Often it is peddled as an immune boosting, disease curing dietary supplement, but there is no scientific evidence to back up these claims. In fact, colloidal silver can be dangerous to your health. Its side effects include permanently turning your skin a bluish-gray and causing poor absorption of certain drugs and antibiotics, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Featured Fact-check “The coronavirus is the common cold, folks.”

Coronaviruses, known for their crown-like spikes, are a large family of viruses that can be found in many different types of animals including cattle and bats.

Rarely, the coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and create new human coronaviruses that make people sick.

There are seven strains of coronavirus that can infect people, and most people get cold-like symptoms. Three strains, including COVID-19, can cause acute respiratory distress and spread rapidly.

While much about the pandemic causing disease is still unknown here’s what scientists do know:

""COVID-19 spreads between people who have been in close contact or through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.""

""Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure and include fever, a cough and shortness of breath.""

""Older adults and people who have serious chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease are at a higher risk of getting very sick from this illness.""

""There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19.""

Our ruling

Sellman claimed that a Silver Solution used on strains of coronavirus ""totally eliminate it. Kills it. Deactivates it.""

No, no, and no.

There are no pills or remedies that cure any strain of human coronavirus including COVID-19. In fact, Sellman’s ""silver solution,"" and colloidal silver, can hurt you, and not just your wallet."

Mike Parson says that his workforce development agenda and initiatives are working and creating more jobs.

At a Feb. 14 speech to the County Commissioners Association of Missouri, he said: ""Right now we have over 40,000 new jobs in a little over 18 months."" It’s a number he’s used in his State of the State address in January and in other places since October.

Parson got the state’s top job on June 1, 2018, following the resignation of Eric Greitens. So he’s been governor for a little more than 20 months.

How close is he to 40,000? Not very. Can he take credit for job increases? That’s another question.

Parson’s workforce development agenda

Parson has made jobs a vital part of his agenda. He advocated for the Fast Track Workforce Incentive Grant in his 2019 State of the State address. The grant helps people gain workforce skills through certificate or degree programs to go into high-need jobs, according to the Missouri Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development. (The law went into effect on Aug. 5).

He also created, through executive order on Nov. 12, an Office of Apprenticeship to create opportunities for Missourians to gain needed skills to get into the workforce.

We contacted Parson’s administration about his claim. His staff gave us a link to the state Department of Economic Development’s jobs report.

The research division of the Missouri Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development shows Missouri gained 36,800 jobs on the nonfarm payroll from June 2018 (When Parson took office after former governor Eric Greitens’ resignation) to November 2019. Seasonally adjusted data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is in line with Missouri’s Economic Research Information Center’s numbers.

So, the governor’s number is 8% off — but only if you end the count there. December data released on Jan. 23 showed that Missouri lost 8,500 jobs in that month.

That would bring the total job increase from June 2018 to December 2019 to 28,300 — well short of 40,000. Featured Fact-check Because the Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates to near 0%, “the Fed will be of little consequence now. They’ve already used what leverage they have.”

(It is worth noting that as of March 4, 2020, Missouri lost even more, 5,800 jobs, which would bring the total to 22,500 since Parson took office. That data was reported after the governor made his claim, though.)

Taking credit for jobs

Can Parson claim jobs increasing is because of him, his administration and workforce development policies?

As noted above, a few of his workforce development initiatives were just recently enacted.

Even if they had been put in place on Day One of his administration, he cannot be fully credited for the increase.

As we’ve noted in previous PolitiFact fact-checks such as this one on former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, a governor can’t really take full credit — or blame — for the rise or fall in jobs.

There are many factors that affect the state of Missouri’s economy such as the U.S. economy or international affairs, which affect goods and services in the state. One person or administration cannot be the sole factor.

It is like the quarterback of a football team. While very important to the team and the outcome of a game, he is not to be fully credited or blamed for the team’s efforts.

Our ruling

Parson said: ""Right now we have over 40,000 new jobs in a little over 18 months.""

Taking into account December data, the number of jobs created since Mike Parson took office only rises to 28,300. His claim may have been close when he made it last fall, but it is not now."

The unemployment rate isn’t the same as Reisch claims, but it’s really low.

Since January 2018, Missouri has added more than 28,000 jobs, with its unemployment rate staying steadily below the national average.

But more jobs can lead to other problems, state Rep. Cheri Toalson Reisch, R-Hallsville, said.

Amidst a low employment rate, Reisch claimed small-to-medium sized retail stores in Boone County have lost their employees to larger businesses new or expanding in the county.

""In Boone County, with a 1.7 percent unemployment rate, we can’t find enough people, we can’t fill all the job openings,"" she said during a House Special Committee hearing on criminal justice reform on Feb. 1.

Reisch is pushing a bill that would make it easier for stores selling liquor or lottery tickets to hire ex-felons who committed certain non-violent crimes.

We delved into several government-issued data and spoke with a couple of business leaders in Boone County to see whether she made accurate points in the statement.

She’s pretty close. Here’s why.

Unemployment rate

Reisch found the county’s 1.7% unemployment rate from homefacts.com. The website says as of September, Boone County’s unemployment rate is 1.7%. It doesn’t list a recent rate.

Becky Dunn, of the Missouri Department of Higher Education & Workforce Development, confirmed the unemployment number through September. In December,the rate rose to 2.4 %, according to a department report.

So, Reisch’s number was outdated. But the 2.4% rate is still notably low. The Federal Reserve calls a range of 3.5% to 4.5% to be a ""natural rate.""

Law of the jungle

Casey’s General Stores and other small-to-medium sized retail stores have lost their employees to new or expanding larger businesses in Boone County, Reisch claimed.

""There are businesses losing their valuable employees because, say, Veterans United can pay more or have better benefits,"" she said.

An ongoing trend of employee shortfall among small-to-medium sized businesses is due to a rising wage competition with larger businesses, said Bernie Andrews, executive vice president at the Regional Economic Development Inc. Featured Fact-check Because the Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates to near 0%, “the Fed will be of little consequence now. They’ve already used what leverage they have.”

When incentivizing larger companies like Aurora Organic Dairy, the county government requires them to pay at least its average hourly wage of $18.83, or $39,196 an year, to most employees — and not many retail stores could afford paying that rate, Andrews said.

This employee’s migration to large companies and shorfall for small businesses isn’t a trend just for Boone County, he said.

""There are more jobs open than there are people to fill them"" locally and nationally, he said.

An average annual salary for a retail salesperson in mid-Missouri is $27,737, according to a January report by the Department of Higher Education & Workforce Development. Here are the area job openings that month that required short-term, on-the-job training and little to no work experience:

713: retail sales

281: customer services

156: food services

142: laborers and movers

129: personal care aides

We also contacted both Aurora Organic Dairy and another large employer, Veterans United Home Loan.

Sonja Tuitele, spokesperson for Aurora Organic Dairy, said her company hired 50 to 60 people for its new Columbia Milk Plant that opened in early 2019. When hiring them, she said the company gave preference to those with specific food manufacturing experience.

Chris Cline of Veterans United Home Loans told us his company hired about 1,000 new employees in 2019 for its branch in Boone County. Those employees were hired for positions ranging from customer-facing production to information technology.

In the end, it’s a business law of the jungle — large businesses with better pay and benefits get employees they need whereas small businesses lose employees to the large.

Our ruling

Reisch said, ""In Boone County, with a 1.7 percent unemployment rate, we can’t find enough people, we can’t fill all the job openings.""

She used an outdated number that has since grown, but it’s not that much different."

https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/31/eric-schmitt/schmitt-rates-mostly-true-claim-about-opioid-death/,2019-12-31T00:00:00,Schmitt rates Mostly True on claim about opioid deaths,"As cases of opioid use disorder continue to wreak havoc across the U.S., many states have taken steps to address the issue. Missouri is one of more than 30 states that brought a lawsuit against opioid manufacturers, alleging the companies misrepresented the dangerous and addictive nature of the drugs.

Stating that 140 deaths per day are caused by opioid-related overdoses emphasizes the high stakes of the opioid crisis, so we wanted to see if Schmitt’s number was correct.

Speaking at a roundtable discussion about the opioid epidemic Nov. 25, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who inherited Missouri’s lawsuit when he took office, said, ""You have literally 140 people dying every day of opioid-related overdoses. That’s like a passenger plane going down every day of every week of every month of every year of every decade.""

When asked about where Schmitt found the statistic, Chris Nuelle, the attorney general’s press secretary, said that opioid-related research can fluctuate, so it can be hard to get exact numbers. He also noted that Schmitt has often attributed 130 deaths per day to opioids, though Nuelle believes the 140 number is still accurate.

Nuelle pointed to a National Institute on Drug Abuse article that attributed more than 130 deaths per day and provided the link to a U.S. News & World Report story that analyzed opioid data, but did not indicate the number of deaths due to opioid overdoses each day at all.

The most reliable and most recent data available on drug and opioid overdose deaths in the U.S. comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s most recent data was released in 2018 and analyzes 2017 drug and opioid overdose deaths.

In 2017, there were 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the United States. Of those deaths, 47,600 — or 67.8% of all drug overdose deaths — involved some type of opioids whether natural, synthetic or semisynthetic.

When you break these statistics down into deaths per day, there were approximately 192 drug overdose deaths each day on average in 2017. Of those 192 deaths, about 130 each day involved an opioid. This statistic does not match up exactly with Schmitt’s claim that there are 140 opioid-related deaths daily in the U.S.

Jasmine Reed, a public affairs specialist at the CDC, said in an email that the 130 daily deaths from opioid overdoses is an average calculated by dividing the total number of opioid overdoses in the year by the number of days in a year. She said this means the number is not an absolute figure, but that it is more accurate to say there are 130 opioid overdose deaths in the U.S. each day than it is to say there are 140.

The CDC estimates that between 1999 and 2017, more than 702,000 people have died from a drug overdose, and about 399,000 of those deaths were due to opioid overdoses. Overall, the number of opioid overdose deaths each day and drug overdose deaths each day have both been steadily increasing within that time period.

If the number of opioid overdose deaths continued growing steadily, as it has in past years, the number of deaths each day in 2019 might, in fact, be 140 or even exceed 140. However, this is not yet known because the final counts of overdose deaths for 2018 and 2019 have not been released.

The CDC has released provisional data for 2018 that indicates the number of drug overdose deaths dropped from 70,237 in 2017 to 68,110 in 2018. The CDC warns that this number is likely ""underreported due to incomplete data,"" but the overall drop suggests that opioid-related overdoses also decreased in 2018. This could mean the number of opioid overdose deaths is actually less than 130 per day.

Reasons for overdoses

Aaron Williams, senior director for training and technical assistance for substance abuse at the National Council For Behavioral Health, explained there are a number of reasons why opioid overdose deaths constitute such a large portion of drug overdose deaths.

""Over the last decade and a half, there has been a significant increase in the prescription of and use of opioid-based medications for pain, in particular,"" Williams said. He said many people developed substance use problems due to this uptick, which increased overdose deaths because high doses of opioids can cause respiratory depression that leads to death.

Williams also said in recent years illegal opioids have become easier to get, with heroin getting ""cheaper and purer"" as one example. He said potent synthetic opioids (tramadol, fentanyl, etc.) have moved into the pipeline as well.

Our ruling

""You have literally 140 people dying every day of opioid-related overdoses,"" Attorney General Eric Schmitt said at a public discussion about the opioid epidemic.

The most recent data available from 2017 indicates that it’s actually about 130 people who die every day from overdoses involving opioids. Schmitt was off by only about 10 deaths."

In a Nov. 20 interview with St. Louis Public Radio, Jensen expressed frustration over St. Louis’ crime rate. His one positive note, however, was about the recidivism rate for the Eastern District of Missouri probation office, which includes St. Louis and Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

""It’s nothing I do, but the probation office here in the Eastern District of Missouri is the best in the country,"" he said. ""They have about a 7.5% recidivism rate, compared to national averages of 70 or 80%.""

We’ve had a similar check in Wisconsin, but we haven’t delved into Missouri’s Eastern District. Does it really outperform the rest of the country? Here’s what we found.

Jensen is making an apples-to-oranges comparison between district and national numbers.

It’s impossible to check whether the Eastern District is the best in the nation because the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics doesn’t study recidivism at state and county levels.

An apples-to-oranges comparison

The numbers are difficult to compare.

Scott Anders, chief U.S. probation officer for the Eastern District, responded to PolitiFact’s request for the source of Jensen’s statistics. Featured Fact-check Says of the Milwaukee mass shooter: ""Supposedly he is black. A noose was hung on his locker and he addressed the issue and he was fired! So he returned the next work day and killed who he all thought were involved.""

The district’s numbers match Jensen’s claim. In 2019, 7.5% of people under supervision — prisoners on parole, supervised release or probation — were rearrested, Anders said. Additionally, the rearrest rate from 2012 to 2016 averaged 7.76%, according to the Eastern District’s rearrest reports.

It’s not as easy as Jensen made it seem to compare those rates to national averages. In a report that studied recidivism rates of state prisoners from 2005 to 2014, the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics broke up the rates into one-year, three-year, six-year and nine-year periods.

Here’s what the study found: 44% of state prisoners were arrested within one year after release, 68% were arrested within three years, 79% within six years and 83% within nine years.

So, while the statistics match Jensen’s ballpark estimate of a 70 or 80% national recidivism rate, he is making an apples-to-oranges comparison when weighing them against the Eastern District’s rate. Best in the country?

The first part of Jensen’s claim — that the Eastern District is the best in the country — is more difficult to check.

Bureau of Justice Statistics spokesperson Tannyr Watkins wrote in an email that the bureau has not studied recidivism rates for individual states or counties. There’s no other governmental group that tracks the rates by district across the country.

Our ruling

U.S. attorney Jeff Jensen said his district’s probation office is the best in the nation. He noted the office’s recidivism rate — 7.5% — and compared it to the nation’s rate of 70% or 80%.

Jensen had both his numbers for the Eastern district’s rate and the national averages straight, but he was making a comparison across different time periods. The Bureau of Justice Statistics also hasn’t studied recidivism rates at a state or county level, so there’s nothing to say it’s the best in the nation."

""There are numerous resources for crime statistics, from the FBI to Wikipedia. I’ve seen reports in both the Post-Dispatch and KC Star on this topic. I wasn’t quoting a specific article.""

We looked. The articles Evans might have been citing look into metropolitan crime, not Missouri in general. And the Wikipedia page ""Crime in Missouri"" contained statistics from 2011.

So we decided to dig some more.

Looking at the data

The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program is the main source for most statistics about crime. The two most prominent categories are violent crime and property crime. Violent crime is defined as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Property crime includes burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson.

In 2018, the United States violent crime rate per 100,000 residents was 380.6 compared to 502.1 for Missouri.

Both fell last year from 20l7 to 2018 after three years of increases. Missouri’s violent crime last year decreased by 5.2% while the United States saw a 3% decrease.

In the larger picture, Missouri’s violent crime rate has increased in the last five years.

In 2013, the state’s violent crime rate per 100,000 residents was 433.7, and in 2018 that number was up to 502.1.

In 2013, the United States violent crime rate per 100,000 residents was 379.1, and in 2018 was 380.6.

""I always say you want to look at crime trends, you have to look at a span that's more than just year to year, you have to look kind of at a five-year trend,"" said Aida Hass-Wisecup, a criminology professor at Missouri State University.

In property crime, the nation saw a steady decrease in the past five years. Missouri’s property crime rate has had some fluctuations, like from 2016 to 2017 there was a 1.5% increase. But overall, the property crime rate for five years decreased in Missouri.

Evans’ response includes murder rates, so we looked into that too. In Missouri, murder rates have increased since 2013. The United States saw a large spike from 2014 to 2016 in murder rates, but they’ve decreased since then.

Other cautions on the data

Hass-Wisecup noted that analyzing crime by metropolitan statistical areas, because looking at the overall state can leave ""a very distorted perception.""

""You kind of have to take crime data with caution,"" Hass-Wisecup said. ""Sometimes, arrest does not mean more crime, it means more crime is being detected, because of law enforcement becoming more vigilant.""

In fact, on the FBI’s 2018 Crime in the United States page, it says, ""It is important for users of UCR data, including federal data, to avoid drawing such simplistic conclusions as one area is safer than another or one agency is more or less efficient than another based solely on crime counts.""

Our ruling

Evans said, ""Missouri, in general, has more crime, percentage-wise, than the rest of the country. So, we are seeing overall crime throughout the country is going down but not here in Missouri.""

According to the FBI data, Missouri’s violent crime rate has risen sharply over the past five years. The national rate has risen, but not by much. For property crime, the state and nation have seen decreases since 2013.

Evans’ claim is partially accurate, but generalizes the state and ignores the most recent FBI data. We rate this claim Half True."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/nov/16/brian-treece/columbias-economy-may-be-booming-it-hasnt-beat-out/,2019-11-16T00:00:00,"Columbia’s economy may be booming, but it hasn’t beat out the nation","Columbia Mayor Brian Treece boasts that his city has the strongest economy in Missouri.

At an October press conference with Gov. Mike Parson, Treece claimed: ""We’re one of the fastest growing cities in the region, the only city in the state to grow jobs faster than the nation as a whole.""

Is Columbia the economic powerhouse that Treece claims it to be?

Treece was referencing a 2018 article from the Columbia Daily Tribune in his claim, which cited a report by two University of Missouri economics professors, Joseph H. Haslag and John H. Holtmann Jr.

The report, ""On the Columbia Economy: A Comparison across Missouri and across Counties,"" looked at four cities in Missouri — Columbia, Springfield, St. Louis and Kansas City — and found that Columbia’s economy outperforms the other cities in a number of categories.

The first category, gross domestic product growth, measures the final goods and services produced in an area in a period of time. Haslag and Holtmann studied the GDP growth rate for each city from 2001 to 2016. Columbia’s was the highest at 1.81%, which is also greater than 1.69%, the growth rate for the country.

So, Columbia’s GDP growth is a good indicator that the city is outdoing the nation. However, Treece claimed that Columbia’s job growth was faster than that of the nation.

Haslag and Holtmann’s report only compares Columbia’s job growth to the other major cities in Missouri. It doesn’t make the comparison with the nation. Featured Fact-check Because the Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates to near 0%, “the Fed will be of little consequence now. They’ve already used what leverage they have.”

According to the report, Columbia’s payroll employment — the standard measure of the number of jobs a region has — increased at an average annual rate of 2% from 1990 to 2018. The Missouri average was .78%. But the report does not cite the payroll employment rate for the nation.

Total payroll employment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that Columbia is behind the rate of the nation. From January 2009 to January 2019, the U.S. saw an average annual growth rate of nonfarm employment of 1.18%. In that same time period, Columbia’s average annual growth rate was .97%.

So, while Columbia may be beating the rest of the state in job growth, it is not outperforming the nation, as Treece claimed.

Treece also said that Columbia is the only city in the state to have this impressive job growth.

Because they account for 70% of the total economic production in Missouri, Haslag and Holtmann’s report only studied Columbia, St. Louis, Kansas City and Springfield. Other cities in Missouri were not included in the study, so it’s not clear whether Columbia is the only city in the state to experience this growth.

Our ruling

Treece said that Columbia is ""one of the fastest growing cities in the region, the only city in the state to grow jobs faster than the nation as a whole.""

Treece was correct in asserting that Columbia is one of the fastest growing cities in the region from an economic standpoint. Haslag and Holtmann’s report shows that Columbia has the highest GDP growth out of the four major metropolitan cities in Missouri.

However, Treece also said that Columbia is the only city in the state to have jobs grow faster than the nation. Data from the BLS indicates this isn't true, as the U.S. saw a greater average annual payroll employment growth rate than Columbia."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/nov/16/nicole-galloway/claim-missouri-among-highest-rates-uninsured-child/,2019-11-16T00:00:00,Claim that Missouri has among the highest rates of uninsured children misses part of the data,"Nicole Galloway, state auditor and Democratic candidate for Missouri governor, said in an email she’s running for governor to ""help the children who are not being protected by the current Jefferson City administration."" She added that ""in 2018, the year Mike Parson took office, Missouri saw a 9% drop in children insured under Medicaid and CHIP.""

She called for the expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and said: ""Missouri has one of the highest rates of uninsured children in the country, and it’s completely avoidable.""

Galloway’s office cited a September 2019 report from the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission to support her claim. It showed Missouri had the largest decline — 15.1% — in children covered by those two insurance programs between May 2017 and May 2019.

Does that mean Missouri’s uninsured children rate is actually one of the country’s highest?

How kids get covered

Most children are covered by their parent’s insurance, but if a parent is uninsured they may be eligible for coverage from Medicaid and CHIP. Children are eligible for Medicaid if their parents meet the income threshold of 150% of the federal poverty level, which according to the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation is $25,750 a year for a family of four.

CHIP expands Medicaid’s coverage and covers children whose parents’ income is still low, but doesn’t meet the threshold.

An enrollment decline could be a good thing if more people are getting insurance through jobs with health benefits. That’s not necessarily the case, according to Samantha Artiga, director of the Disparities Policy Project and associate director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Featured Fact-check “Every election year has a disease” ... SARS in 2004; avian flu in 2008; swine flu in 2010; MERS in 2012; Ebola in 2014 and 2018; Zika in 2016 and the coronavirus in 2020.

""Some of that enrollment decline may reflect people who are coming off of coverage because of problems completing renewals or other systems or processes issues, not necessarily because they're no longer eligible for the coverage,"" she said.

What’s not covered in the report

Medicaid and CHIP enrollment rates aren’t necessarily the same thing as uninsured rates, said Gerald Kominski, a health policy and management professor and senior fellow at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.

According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research organization, Missouri’s rate of uninsured people from the ages 0 to 18 was the same as the national average at 5% in 2017, the most recent year data was available. ""Saying Missouri has one of the highest rates is stretching; it’s high, but it’s higher in neighboring states,"" Kominski said in an email.

Some examples of states with higher rates of uninsured children are Oklahoma with 8%, and Nebraska with 6%. Texas had the highest rate of uninsured children at 11%. Overall, Missouri is tied with nine other states for 15th highest in the nation.

Our ruling

""Missouri has one of the highest rates of uninsured children in the country,"" Nicole Galloway said in an email to voters.

While the data Galloway used shows Missouri had the steepest decline in Medicaid and CHIP enrollment, those programs are a subset of the overall uninsurance rates. The enrollment declines between 2017 and 2019 don’t by themselves show that Missouri had one of the country’s highest rates of uninsured children."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/nov/15/kay-hoflander/no-hillary-clinton-not-currently-laying-groundwork/,2019-11-15T00:00:00,"No, Hillary Clinton is not currently laying the groundwork to run for president in 2020","With the 2020 general election just under a year away, major political parties on both sides of the aisle are ramping up fundraising. For the Missouri GOP, this has included making some bold claims, such as the one made in an email by Chairwoman of the Missouri Republican Party Kay Hoflander.

The October 11 email said, ""Have you seen the recent news about Hillary? All signs seem to point to Hillary laying the groundwork to run for president again...GOOD! We welcome her to lose again next November, especially here in Missouri.""

It’s a tactic to strike fear in the hearts of the Grand Old Party’s potential donors. On its face, a Clinton run seems unlikely. But we were curious. Are there any signs suggesting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is planning another run for president in 2020? We decided to investigate.

Candidate filings

We started by looking into the basics — Federal Election Commission statements of candidacy.

According to FEC rules, any individual running for federal office must register as a candidate within 15 days of becoming a candidate, which occurs when he or she has raised or spent more than $5,000.

Clinton filed her original statement of candidacy for the 2008 election about 21 months before the general election. She filed her original statement of candidacy for the 2016 election nearly 19 months before the general election.

If Clinton were to file a statement of candidacy now — joining President Donald Trump and fellow Democrats, all of whom have already declared their candidacy to the FEC — she would be doing so only 12 months before the general election.

If Clinton decided on a late-stage run, she would also not be on the primary ballot in Alabama.

The deadline to qualify and be on the March 3, 2020, ballot in Alabama was last Friday. While former New York City mayor and businessman Michael Bloomberg made headlines last week by filing paperwork to qualify, Clinton did not take the same step.

What has Clinton said about running?

At least twice, Clinton made flat out denials: ""I’m not running,"" she told New York television in March. ""But I’m going to keep working and speaking and standing up for what I believe.""

""No, I’m not going to run again,"" she told BBC Radio 4’s ""Woman’s Hour"" in October 2017.

Jean Evans, the GOP executive director, in an email response specifically cited two articles she said indicate that Clinton’s behavior is ""typical of someone who is seriously considering candidacy."" The first article from the Washington Post said Clinton is being urged to run, but in the same sentence also said she ""signaled that she isn’t planning to run — at least, not at the moment.""

Evans’ second example was the rumors after Clinton teased at the idea of a 2020 run on Twitter. On Oct. 8, Trump tweeted that Clinton should enter the presidential race, and Clinton responded, ""Don’t tempt me.""

Despite this, former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said in January he believes Clinton when she says she isn’t running. He told CNN’s Erin Burnett that the idea of a 2020 Clinton run was ""media catnip.""

One of Clinton’s former advisors, Philippe Reines, said in late October that Clinton had not ruled out a 2020 run entirely.

Experts weigh-in

Stuart Streichler, a University of Washington affiliate associate professor of law, societies, and justice, said there are a number of problems Clinton would face entering the race so late in the game. Streichler — who has provided volunteer legal counsel to Sen. Al Gore’s presidential campaign and worked as a Wisconsin poll observer during Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential run — explained that it would be ""highly unusual"" for someone to enter the race at this point.

""A lot of the staff — the talent that you would want to get as staff — are already working for other candidates,"" Streichler said. Featured Fact-check Says a photo of Pete Buttigieg in a military uniform was staged.

Adjunct professor of law at American University Louis Caldera said leading candidates ""already have an extensive ground game in Iowa and in the early primary states with millions in the bank,"" which makes it even less likely that Clinton would try to jump in now.

Streichler said money and donors are already committed to other candidates.

Streichler and Caldera acknowledged that Clinton would have name recognition on her side if she decided to run. But Streichler said he thinks ""there’s almost a zero percent chance"" someone new could successfully enter the Democratic field now unless there was a major shift.

(Example: In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would not seek re-election after almost losing the New Hampshire primary to Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Johnson’s departure allowed candidates like Sen. Robert F. Kennedy — who entered the race just days after the embarrassing New Hampshire primary — to gain a foothold.)

Caldera, who also has an extensive background in public service including serving as President Bill Clinton’s Secretary of the Army and working in the Obama White House, added that someone entering the race late would need a ""breakout moment."" But he thinks the odds of Clinton jumping into the race are low.

""One of the truisms of politics is that the closer you get to the Election Day, the fewer undecided votes there are to convince,"" Caldera said.

Clinton’s Democratic colleagues in the Senate have also warned her against another run for president, and her allies have said they are not taking the talk of her running again in 2020 seriously, according to Politico reporting.

Why did the GOP make this claim?

The Missouri GOP appears to be using this claim to spur fundraising; the email ends with the sentence, ""I am not asking for much, but I am asking for participation to make sure we don't see a President Biden, Warren, Sanders, or Clinton in our future!"" It is followed by Kay Hoflander’s sign-off and a button that reads, ""Click to give $1 or a [sic] more now!""

Caldera said this is not a new tactic.

""In politics, party leaders like to fire up the base by trotting out the people who they think they’ll get the strongest response to,"" Caldera said.

He explained that even in local elections, unpopular members of the opposing party are often brought up. Because getting President Trump reelected is the primary job of Republican party leaders, Caldera said it made sense that they would single out Hillary Clinton, who stirs up strong negative reactions among GOP supporters, as a potential threat to Trump’s in 2020.

""You know, it’s throwing red meat,"" Caldera said. ""It’s getting people to try to have an immediate negative response and leading them to click on the ‘donate now’ button.""

He added that as the incumbent president, Trump can run against the Democratic party as a whole or he can target individual opponents. But Caldera explained that Trump would want to avoid elevating any potential Democratic nominees at this stage.

""It’s a lot easier to say, ‘Hey, remember that person who almost beat him the last time and that we really don’t like? She might jump in the race if we’re not really formidable in our fundraising and scare her off,"" Caldera said.

Our ruling

Kay Hoflander said, ""All signs seem to point to Hillary laying the groundwork to run for president again,"" in a Missouri GOP fundraising email.

Clinton has not filed as a candidate with the FEC, and it is no longer possible for her to get on the primary ballot in Alabama.

In previous months, Clinton has said she will not run, and experts believe it would be difficult for her to enter the race now. Experts also said Clinton hasn’t done anything that would be considered ""laying the groundwork"" to run again.

Despite whispers and rumors, at this time no concrete steps have been taken to lay the groundwork for a Clinton 2020 campaign. The claim appears to be an unsubstantiated fundraising tactic."

""With record lows in unemployment, more people are going back to work in Missouri,"" Parson said Sept. 8. ""Wages are on the rise — in fact we were the top small-business wage growth state in the nation.""

Does the governor’s comment check out? We wanted to investigate.

By the numbers

A spokesperson for Parson’s campaign cited an April 2019 article from St. Louis Business Journal that used numbers from an April 2019 report from Paychex/IHS Market Small Business Employment Watch to show Missouri ranked first in the country in hourly wage growth for small businesses.

At $25.55 per hour, Missouri small business wages were up 3.48%, or 86 cents, that month. The Show-Me State finished first ahead of California, New York, Arizona and Illinois in small-business wage growth.

According to the Small Business Employment Watch’s September report, Missouri now ranks third in the country in hourly wage growth increase at 3.38% (New York is second at 3.53% and Illinois is first at 4.11%). If assessing for weekly wage growth rise, Missouri is second at 3.83%. Illinois comes in at 3.84%, just .01% better than Missouri.

Overall, Missouri has been a top-five small business wage growth state (by weekly earnings) every month this year, according to Paychex’s analysis. Featured Fact-check Because the Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates to near 0%, “the Fed will be of little consequence now. They’ve already used what leverage they have.”

So what is Paychex, and how does it calculate its data for the Small Business Employment Watch? Paychex is a human resources and payroll company with over 600,000 clients nationwide. According to a media spokesperson for the company, it ""uses up-to-date, aggregated payroll data from approximately 350,000 of Paychex's small business clients with fewer than 50 workers"" to keep its data current.

All businesses whose wage data is included in the report must have run payroll for the month that the data is being compiled and the three months prior. According to a Paychex spokesperson, the sample includes millions of small-business workers.

How many small-business workers are there in Missouri and in the United States? It depends what you consider a small business.

Paychex defines a small business as a firm with fewer than 50 workers, but the U.S. Small Business Administration defines small businesses as firms with less than 500 workers. According to the SBA’s 2019 profile for the state of Missouri, there are 1.2 million small business employees in the state of Missouri alone, and 58.9 million in the country.

In other words, while Paychex represents a significant portion of small businesses, it’s not the whole pie. The company itself claims to work with one in 12 private sector employees.

Our ruling

Parson said, ""Wages are on the rise — in fact we were the top small business wage growth state in the nation.""

This statement is backed by statistics from Paychex that showed it to be true for the month of April, although Missouri fell behind in later months."

The vote is set to end Friday. Union workers’ demands have centered around health care benefits, better wages and job protection. Some of the deal’s terms for hourly workers include a 3% wage increase in an employee’s second and fourth year with the company, a $60,000 bonus for 2,000 eligible production and 60 skilled workers who are set to retire, and protections on vacation time.

Part of the argument made by UAW Local 2250 President Glenn Kage was that the union has helped GM remain financially stable over the course of the past decade. Local 2250 is the UAW chapter for the Wentzville, Missouri GM plant that manufactures full-sized vans.

""General Motors is making record profits,"" Kage said in a Sept. 16 interview with the Missouri Times, ""and they can’t do so without the hard work of our members who have earned pay increases, earned better benefits, earned for our temporary workers to be converted to permanent workers, earned job protections.""

Whether GM is making record profits depends on the time period.

""My first question would be: for when? Because profits, as an accounting concept, is measured over a period of time, like a quarter or a year. So when someone just says record profits, they're leaving something (out),"" said Tim Howald, an adjunct accountancy and finance professor at the University of Missouri.

In 2014, GM's quarterly profits were moving in a steady upward direction, eventually leading into a record year in 2015.

According to GM’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, GM’s income was $9.7 billion for 2015, up from $2.8 billion in 2014. The increase leveled off in 2016, when income was $9.4 billion.

The increased profits in 2015 can be attributed, in part, to the increased demand for high-margin pickup trucks and utility vehicles. The so-called Detroit Big Three manufacturers — GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler — specialize in these vehicles.

They are popular at a time when ""we’re selling the most expensive vehicles we ever have,"" said Bernard Swiecki, director of the Automotive Communities Partnership at the Center for Automotive Research.

""Then within that is the move towards trucks and also crossover vehicles, which are cars that look like trucks,"" he said. ""Essentially because they are more profitable than sedans, that's driving higher profits for all automakers, but for the Detroit three in particular, because they dominate pickup trucks.""

Part of what drove the profit increase also led to the strike.

""GM had about a million units of unused sedan capacity,"" Swiecki said. ""That brings us right back around to why they're making money — the market moved to trucks and that's good, in a way, because you get a more profitable GM. But (it’s) bad if you happen to be a GM manufacturing employee who’s in a sedan plant.""

Comparatively, in 2017, the company lost $3.9 billion. This was due, in part, to adjustments to new tax laws. GM recovered in 2018 with a net income of $7.9 billion, but that wasn’t record-setting.

Our ruling

Kage said, ""General Motors is making record profits."" According to GM’s SEC filings, GM had record profits in 2015, but not in the past two years, when GM’s profits have actually been decreasing. Although the recent years’ profits are higher than they were in the early to mid 2010s, they still aren’t considered record-setting.

With that data, we rate this claim Half True."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/oct/25/chain-email/no-there-arent-14000-abandoned-wind-turbines-litte/,2019-10-25T00:00:00,"No, there aren’t 14,000 abandoned wind turbines littered across the United States","Missouri recently made headlines for planning a new wind project in Boone County, north of Columbia. In April, President Donald Trump made the ""pants on fire"" claim that windmills cause cancer. Locally, renewable energy companies that fund wind energy projects in Missouri have recently made headlines for planning a new wind project in Boone County, just south of Harrisburg.

Now, a widely-circulated chain email has resurfaced a claim industry experts have seen all too often: ""14,000 abandoned wind turbines litter the United States.""

This isn’t true. Wind energy proponents have been trying to dispel the claim for years, and 14,000 seems to be a fabricated number. The trouble is no one can say exactly how many ""abandoned"" wind turbines there are.

Abandoned wind turbines

Much of the email chain’s content appears to have been copied from an article on a blog site called American Elephants, which describes itself as a home of conservatives. The anonymous blog post was published July 7, 2013, meaning this claim is at least six years old.

Wind energy experts have been trying to debunk this claim as a myth for just as long.

""It’s bullshit,"" said Paul Gipe, who has published five books on wind energy since 1995 and who has closely studied California’s wind farms. (Now the American Wind Energy Association does that.)

Gipe said there have never been 14,000 abandoned wind turbines in California, in the United States, in North America or anywhere in the world. But at one time, there were approximately 14,000 wind turbines in California, total. He says he is ""the author of that number"" and believes that it is the origin of the 14,000 figure used in the email chain.

Experts from the wind energy association agree that the claim is blatantly false, but the organization has struggled to correct the misconception.

""We know for a fact that it’s not true,"" said Kaitlin Monaghan, the association’s deputy director of permitting and asset management policy. ""We’re not sure why it’s been so hard for us to myth-bust it or why it’s kind of still floating around out there, but I think sometimes that’s how it goes.""

James Owen, executive director of Renew Energy, a company that champions renewable energy , said he doesn’t know of any abandoned wind turbines in the state of Missouri. He, too, agreed that there is no evidence for the abandoned turbines claim.

""To the extent I’ve seen, there’s absolutely no basis for that,"" Owen said. ""It just seems like a number that was made up.""

Why it wouldn’t happen

Monaghan acknowledged that wind turbines age and typically have a useful life of 20 to 30 years. At that time, she said old equipment must be taken down, repaired or replaced.

If a project owner chooses to close a wind farm completely, Monaghan explained, it is the responsibility of the owner to decommission the farm, which includes removing wind turbines and restoring the land to its original state. She said there are often local and state laws that require this of individuals operating wind farms.

However, 99% of wind projects are built on private land, so lease contracts for land used for turbines often include requirements for project owners to remove turbines and restore land when a project is shut down, Monaghan said.

With this in mind, Monaghan explained that there are a number of reasons why project owners would not simply ""abandon"" wind turbines — meaning leave turbines standing despite not being functional. In areas where constructing wind farms requires permits, a project owner must often provide a detailed plan upfront for the eventual decommissioning of the project. Sometimes, owners will even have to provide a ""parent company guarantee,"" or some sort of financial backing, to reassure the community that no abandoned wind turbines will be left behind.

On top of this, Monaghan said it would hurt companies’ reputations with landowners if they simply abandoned wind turbines. Turbines also have salvage value; the steel and other materials from a project could be repurposed or sold, Monaghan said.

Finally, preexisting farms have already collected extensive wind speed data and have access to transmission lines. Greg Alvarez, deputy director of external communications for the wind energy association, explained that these features are valuable for projects and create ""very, very strong financial incentives to not let these sites sit vacant and abandoned.""

As for those who believe companies are installing wind turbines to get a tax credit and then abandoning them, Owen said that was a ""patently absurd"" idea because companies only make money by selling power generated by the turbines. He said it was also a misunderstanding of the tax credit available.

""The tax credits they’re talking about are production tax credits,"" Owen said, ""so they don’t get the tax credit unless they’re producing something.""

No hard numbers

The U.S. Wind Turbine Database indicates that there are 60,576 turbines operating in the U.S., including Puerto Rico and Guam. In total, wind energy supplies just under 7% of the country’s electricity, according to Alvarez. He said the U.S. wind industry has 97,000 megawatts of installed capacity, which is enough to power about 30 million average American homes.

Energy production is tracked and recorded, as is the installation of wind turbines, but no one is tracking the number of abandoned wind turbines.

The wind energy association's experts said that at most, there is a small number of nonoperational wind turbines that may appear to be abandoned even if they are not. Beyond that, they couldn’t be more specific.

Josh Hawley was accused of scapegoating Mexico for Missouri’s meth problem.

""Don’t blame Mexico for what is produced in our own state under your watch,"" the tweeter, identified as Conrad Hake, wrote. Hake was responding to Hawley’s demand that Democratic presidential hopefuls should declare whether there’s a security threat at the border.

Hawley responded: ""Wrong. Meth production in MO has cratered over last decade. MO Hwy Patrol reported 1,326 meth lab seizures in 2006, only 50 in 2018. But meth addiction & overdoses are skyrocketing. DEA’s 2018 Threat Assessment Report says most of meth in U.S. made in Mexico & smuggled over border.""

That would be a huge decrease, and the DEA report does say meth in the United States is made in Mexico and transported into the United States, so we decided to do some digging on the numbers of meth production.

Missouri State Highway Patrol’s report holds up

The numbers are correct, according to a Missouri State Highway Patrol report. Incidents in Missouri for methamphetamine chemical/equipment/glassware seizures, laboratories and dumpsites was 1,326 in 2006. The most incidents were in St. Charles, at 125 in the same year.

In 2018, Missouri had 50 methamphetamine incidents, the report said.

""The key factor for the decrease in methamphetamine laboratories is the transportation of crystal methamphetamine into the state,"" said Sgt. Shawn Griggs, Missouri State Highway Patrol spokesman. Missouri production is down, but consumption of meth is still here. Featured Fact-check “Replacing marriage licenses with domestic union contracts does not alter state or federal benefits.”

Methamphetamine is still being used

Hawley cited the 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment released by the DEA. It reports that most methamphetamine in the United States is being produced in Mexico.

In 2006, federal and state laws restricted the sale of an over-the-counter cold medicine, pseudoephedrine, that was essential to home-cooked meth. Griggs said 75 communities in the state have created prescription-only ordinances for pseudoephedrine products.

In 2017, Missouri joined an electronic system that tracks and limits the sale of over-the-counter cold and allergy medications containing pseudoephedrine, ephedrine or phenylpropanolamine.

As pseudoephedrine became harder to get in Missouri, production shifted to Mexico, which now manufactures more meth than the United States.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Missouri’s drug-related deaths increased 18.1% from February 2018 to February 2019. Delaware is the only state with a higher increase at 18.6%. Meanwhile, nationally the amount of drug-related deaths decreased 3.9%.

According to data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, from 2012 to 2016 people seeking treatment for meth addiction in Missouri increased 52%.

Just last November, Missouri voters rejected Proposition D, which would have increased the state’s gas tax by 10 cents and used the funds to boost spending on roads and bridges.

Without the additional funding, MoDOT counts on federal grant money to address infrastructure problems like the one posed by Missouri’s aging bridges.

In his Aug. 29 newsletter, U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., announced that MoDOT will receive a $20.7 million federal grant for the state’s bridge replacement program. To highlight the significance of the challenges, Graves said, ""The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old—most were only designed to last for 50 years.""

The problem sounds severe and a little dangerous, so we decided to see if the numbers hold up. To a degree, they do — Graves took the sentence from the MoDOT website.

But that doesn’t mean it’s time to panic every time you drive over a bridge.

How old is old?

MoDOT’s website confirms that the average age of Missouri bridges is 48 years old. An average takes into account all bridges from newly built ones to those much older than 48 years.

So how old are Missouri’s oldest bridges? We don’t know.

State bridge engineer Dennis Heckman pointed out a lack of records before about 1900. About 40 bridges were built before 1909; they are at least 110 years old and might be even older.

Heckman explained that design life doesn’t mean a bridge closes or becomes unsafe on its 50th birthday. Intended design life is not a set expiration date. In reality, it’s more like a sell-by date that indicates when a bridge’s quality needs to be monitored more closely. Featured Fact-check “Trump’s farmer bailout is now twice the size of Obama’s GM bailout. The big difference is GM paid their bailout back — with interest.”

""When they reach that age, you’re going to be maintaining them a lot more, fixing them a lot more,"" Heckman said. ""They just become a lot more high maintenance.""

There’s also some variation in the design life of Missouri’s bridges to take into account. For decades, Heckman said, a 50-year design life was standard, and about 8,000 of MoDOT’s 10,400 bridges have a design life of 50 years. In the past 10 to 15 years, designing bridges with a 75-year life span has become more common; about 2,350 bridges were built to this standard. And longer, river-crossing bridges are built with a design life of 100 years. About 50 bridges currently fall into this 100-year design life category.

In total, 6,000, or 60%, of Missouri’s bridges are past their intended design life, and Heckman said MoDOT’s ability to extend the lifespan of these bridges is unique to each bridge and its specific conditions.

But bridge condition, not intended design life, is what determines MoDOT’s course of action.

Federal law requires all publicly owned highway bridges over 20 feet long to be inspected about once every two years, and currently, 909 of the bridges MoDOT inspects are rated ""poor"" by federal National Bridge Inspection Standards. Poor is the worst rating a bridge can receive and remain open for use.

Poor bridges result in weight limits that hinder economic development and reduce Missourians’ safety, Heckman said. ""Heavier trucks can’t use them. Farmers can’t use them when they’re hauling their grain or hogs to market. So you end up with a lot of detours."" He also said many bridges cannot support the weight of a school bus, firetruck, or ambulance.

Most states strive to have only about 3% to 4% of their bridges ranked poor, Heckman said. Currently, 9% of Missouri’s bridges are poor.

""At our current funding levels, we’re basically treading water,"" said Bob Brendel, MoDOT’s special assignments coordinator. ""We’re basically repairing and replacing about as many bridges every year as fall into the poor category.""

Our ruling

Graves said, ""The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old — most were only designed to last for 50 years."""

It’s hard to say,"If there is one issue that unites Republicans and Democrats, it’s robocalls.

The automated calls that have flooded constituents’ phones are prompting congressional action. Over the summer, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3375, the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act, by a vote of 429-3.

The act amends the Communications Act of 1934 to clarify laws against making robocalls, and puts in place call-blocker technology to prevent future calls.

In an Aug. 9 newsletter, U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Harrisonville, endorsed the act, claiming that ""robocalls prey on the most vulnerable among us, including senior citizens.

""Statistics indicate Americans have experienced 29.3 illegal robocalls so far this year, marking a 64 percent increase since 2016,"" Hartzler wrote.

Hartzler’s statement included a typo, spokesperson Anna Swick said. She meant to say 29.3 billion illegal robocalls. That’s a big oopsy. Swick noted that a July 24 news release included the word billion.

But there’s another wrinkle: How many are really considered illegal?

Any phone call that includes a recorded message rather than a live person is considered a robocall, according to the Federal Trade Commission. If the receiver of the call did not give consent to receive it, the call is considered illegal. So that robocall reminding you of a doctor’s appointment is probably OK; the one promising you riches from a foreign prince probably isn’t. Featured Fact-check “Coronavirus Hoax: Fake Virus Pandemic Fabricated to Cover-Up Global Outbreak of 5G Syndrome.”

We decided to take a closer look into the robocall issue and find out whether Hartzler’s statement — the one with 29.3 ""billion"" that was intended to run — holds up.

The robocall statistics

In her newsletter, Hartzler used numbers from a robocall blocking app called YouMail that were cited in the report for H.R. 3375. But there’s a big difference between Hartzler’s numbers and YouMail’s, and that is the use of the word ""illegal.""

YouMail CEO Alex Quilici said the app tracks the calls made by its 10 million users and uses their area codes to extrapolate the data for the entire country and specific states. The app then funnels that data into a robocall index.

The app does not, however, distinguish between illegal and legal robocalls. YouMail’s data actually reports 29.3 billion total robocalls from January until the end of July.

YouMail gives four categories of calls: alerts, payment reminders, scams, and telemarketing. So, you could guess that the scams are illegal. But Hartzler’s claim didn’t break it down.

Other databases suggest that robocalls are a problem, but the numbers vary by government agency. The Federal Communications Commission received 232,000 robocall complaints in 2018, according to the House Report. The Federal Trade Commission reported 4.1 million robocall complaints in 2018.

Comparing YouMail data and federal data isn’t exactly apples to apples. YouMail tracks all robocalls received by its app users, while the FCC and FTC only collect complaints. These reports can give some sense of the problem, but they leave out those people who don’t file complaints or use call-blocker apps.

Our ruling

Hartzler stated that robocalls target senior citizens, and that Americans have experienced 29.3 illegal robocalls this year. When asked, her office amended the statement to 29.3 billion."

Galloway cited her accomplishments in her Aug. 12 video candidacy announcement: ""I’m a CPA and a Certified Fraud Examiner. It’s my job to be an independent watchdog for taxpayers. To shine a light on government waste, and I found lots of it. Uncovering $350 million in waste and fraud; it led to 40 criminal charges against both Republicans and Democrats.""

Sounds like a lot. We decided to take a closer look at the Democrat’s statement that her office has uncovered $350 million in ""waste and fraud"" and that the discoveries resulted in 40 criminal counts against officials on both sides of the aisle.

The origin of the numbers

When we contacted Galloway’s campaign, a staff member cited the 2018 annual report produced by the auditor’s office. That report is compiled from a running list of audits conducted across the state. The $350 million figure showed up in the report, as did 38 of the alleged criminal counts brought as a result of Galloway’s audits. The campaign showed in news releases additional counts brought after the annual report.

Her office’s press secretary, Steph Deidrick, provided a year-by-year breakdown. It adds up to $356 million from May 2015 to the end of 2018.

Deidrick also provided a chart the office uses to track the number of criminal counts brought as a result of audit findings. The chart listed 19 individuals and tallied up the criminal counts brought against each person; Galloway’s office identified a total of 45 criminal counts, including those filed after the 2018 report.

Waste and fraud

There are 551 audit reports available on the auditor’s website from Galloway’s first full month as auditor in May 2015 to the end of 2018. These reports were used to calculate the total ""waste and fraud"" Galloway said her office uncovered.

We spot-checked individual reports. We also turned to industry professionals to help us understand the terminology.

Sarah Hofmann, spokeswoman of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, explained that within the industry, fraud is a legal term that encompasses deliberate acts that aim to deprive someone of ""property or money by guile, deception or other unfair means.""

Boone County Auditor June Pitchford emphasized that fraud ""generally has an element of illegality"" or deception, while waste can simply be the result of poor management or a lack of due diligence. Featured Fact-check On key issues including taxes, health care, the Green New Deal, abortion, and guns, there is “no daylight between” Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.

For this reason, Hofmann said the distinction Galloway made in her claim that the $350 million was a total of waste and fraud was important. Hofmann said government organizations, in particular, often have ""redundancies, or just places that they’re losing money.""

One example of the fraudulent behavior Galloway uncovered comes from the 2017 audit of Putnam County Memorial Hospital, which uncovered about $92 million in fraudulent lab billing practices. Galloway said the hospital was essentially a shell company.

Hofmann said that shell companies are common examples of fraud known as ""asset misappropriation,"" meaning this $92 million billing scheme would be part of Galloway’s total.

Criminal counts brought as a result of audits

Galloway’s claim that her audits have led to 40 criminal counts against Republicans and Democrats ultimately holds up, though it lacks some important context.

We used Missouri Casenet, a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Missouri, a PDF of charges filed and media accounts to look into the criminal counts brought against the people Galloway indicated in her total.

Our research determined that a total of 52 criminal counts were brought against 19 people as a result of audits from Galloway’s office. Receiving stolen property was the most common criminal charge, with 37 counts. The other charges varied, but included counts of forgery, violations of ethics rules by elected officials and stealing of various amounts.

To check the claim that criminal counts were brought against Republicans and Democrats, we called the cities and counties whose officials faced criminal charges and asked if the offices they held are partisan.

In most cases, the offices are nonpartisan.

Of the 19 individuals charged, only four were elected officials who ran as a Republican or Democrat. Three of those charged were Democrats, and only one was a Republican. The other 15 individuals – or about 79 percent of those charged – were hired employees, nonpartisan appointees or held nonpartisan elected offices.

Our ruling

Galloway said her office ""uncover(ed) $350 million in waste and fraud; it led to 40 criminal charges against both Republicans and Democrats.""

Knowledgeable professionals agree that Auditor Galloway uncovers ""waste and fraud,"" and individual examples of what Galloway has uncovered in her years as auditor indicate the $350 million total is reasonable."

The trade agreement, known as USMCA, has been a hot topic among farmers and politicians over the past year.

In an Aug. 13 Facebook post, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt endorsed the agreement: ""U.S. agricultural & food exports are expected to increase more than $2 billion annually under #USMCA. This trade deal is a win for America’s farmers, ranchers, and businesses.""

A spokesperson for Blunt said the number came from a report by the U.S. International Trade Commission, which says the agreement would increase ""exports by $2.2 billion (1.1 percent) when fully implemented.""

Billions sounds like a lot. The 1.1%, not so much. We decided to look into this claim.

So, what exactly is the agreement?

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is a trade deal that would replace NAFTA. Mexico ratified the new agreement in June. In Canada, Parliament introduced the bill in May but has insisted on going through the ratification process in tandem with the U.S.

The trick is this: The window for Canada’s ratification is getting smaller, as its federal election is Oct. 21. If the U.S. Congress does not move quickly enough and Canada doesn’t ratify before Sept. 15, it will have to reintroduce the agreement to the next Parliament.

Meanwhile, House Democrats control the agreement’s fate in Congress. Featured Fact-check “Trade agreements like NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China, which forced American workers to compete against people making pennies an hour, has resulted in the loss of 160,000 jobs here in Michigan.""

Some call the new deal NAFTA 2.0. One of the big changes to agriculture is dairy. Under the agreement, Canada would increase quotas on dairy and remove restrictions on cheese, said Jonathan Doh, professor at Villanova University School of Business.

But there weren't any other major changes in the agriculture portion from the original NAFTA, according to Pat Westhoff, Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute director. The deal, if passed, would take effect early 2020.

How does it affect Missouri farmers?

Missouri exports its agriculture all across the world, but the state’s top partners are Canada and Mexico.

In 2017, Missouri’s top agriculture exports were corn and soybeans. Missouri corn ranked No. 6 and soybeans No. 8 in the U.S. in exports, according to state data from the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service. Dairy is not listed in the state’s top agricultural exports.

""It’s important to Missouri to have a strong trade agreement with those countries because about two-thirds of our exports from Missouri go to those two countries,"" said Eric Bohl, Missouri Farm Bureau director of public affairs and advocacy. ""Canada is our No. 1 export partner. Mexico is our No. 2 export partner.""

Although Doh said the increase was significant, Westhoff said that the 1.1% projected increase is very marginal, in part because dairy is the only agriculture product with a major change. The United States International Trade Commission does not break down the numbers by state.

Our ruling

Blunt said in a Facebook post, ""U.S. agricultural & food exports are expected to increase more than $2 billion annually under #USMCA.""

The consensus is that the USMCA could increase trade exports by $2.2 billion annually, but that tells only part of the story. The increase is just 1.1% nationally, and probably less for Missouri because the state produces so little dairy."

We may never know,"Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang surprised viewers of the Houston debate when he vowed to give 10 families $1,000 a month, every month, for a year.

Yang wanted to draw attention to his universal basic income plan, in which he would give every adult a $1,000 monthly ""freedom dividend"" if he’s elected.

Yang’s statement caught national attention. Missouri third district congressional candidate Republican Chad Bicknell, posted his thoughts about the statement on Facebook:

""Andrew Yang for President 2020 tonight bribed 10 families at $12,000 dollars each to vote for him. This is a blatant violation of FEC rules and is automatic disqualification to run for any office.""

Should Yang really be out of the race? Turns out the answer isn’t that simple.

Gray area in the law

We reached out to the Federal Election Commission to see if Bicknell’s claim holds up. FEC spokeswoman Judith Ingram said Yang’s scenario is not addressed in the Federal Election Campaign Act or commission rules.

Normally, she said, the Yang campaign would reach out to the FEC for an advisory opinion to assess the legality. However, three of the commission’s six seats are vacant, so no ruling can be made to guide Yang’s team through this ""legal gray area,"" as Ingram calls it.

We reached out to experts from Common Cause and the Campaign Legal Center, two watchdog organizations, to see what they make of Bicknell’s claim.

Paul S. Ryan, vice president for policy and litigation at Common Cause, said there is no precedent for Yang’s plan in FEC rules and, therefore, nothing to suggest it’s a blatant violation.

Ryan noted Yang’s proposal draws the FEC’s ""personal use prohibition"" into question. The rule bans personal ""use of funds in a campaign account of a candidate (or former candidate) to fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense of any person.""

Therein lies the unanswered question: Are these families considered to be ""any person?""

Corey Goldstone, spokesman for the Campaign Legal Center, thinks so.

The personal use prohibition’s purpose is ""to prevent donors from having their money go to line a random family’s pocket,"" he said. ""Campaign funds are meant to go to services provided for the campaign.""

If Ryan were Yang’s lawyer, he’d argue Yang’s ""freedom dividend"" is a separate product. Once the money is handed over, it would no longer be considered part of Yang’s campaign funds, he said.

""It’s a thing. It’s a product. It’s a campaign promotional product analogous to Andrew Yang,"" he said.

But, as both Ryan and Goldstone pointed out, none of this really matters considering those three open commission spots. Until at least one of those seats is filled, questions regarding campaign finance law will go unanswered.

Bicknell cited the FEC. After we reached out to him to check his sources, he updated his post with the ""Expenditures to Influence Voting"" law. The law prohibits candidates from making any payments to any person in exchange for a vote.

Yang didn’t outright ask that these families vote for him, so this law may not apply, Ryan said. He doubted the Justice Department would attempt a prosecution based on how the law has been enforced in the past."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/may/10/are-30-50-shelter-dogs-pit-bulls/,2019-05-10T00:00:00,Do pit bulls account for 30% to 50% of shelter dogs?,"The Missouri legislature is considering a measure that would prevent governments from enacting bans against certain breeds of dogs across the entire state.

Breed specific legislation can be found across the United States, and are more commonly referred to as pit bull bans. These laws can ban the dogs outright, require owners to spay and neuter the dogs, or require owners to register the dogs. In Missouri there is no statewide breed specific legislation, but some cities have enacted their own ordinances concerning the dogs.

A proposed Missouri measure would ban breed specific legislation across the entire state. In the House Select Committee on General Laws hearing on Feb. 27, lobbyist Bob Baker from the Missouri Alliance for Animal Legislation opposed the bill. He reasoned that some cities, specifically Kansas City, need to be able to mandate that owners spay and neuter pit bulls as the breed is overpopulating shelters.

""Our shelters are full of pit bulls. Thirty to 50 percent of dogs in shelters are pit bulls,"" Baker said.

But do pit bulls really make up that much of the shelter population?

Anecdotal data

Baker told us his numbers came from looking at shelter websites and surveying dogs based on the photos that had been posted.

Randi Battson, animal services manager at the Sedalia Animal Shelter, said judging animal populations by shelter websites isn’t a reliable standard because pit bulls sit at shelters longer due to the aggressive stereotype around them.

""The rest of the breeds get adopted more quickly — sometimes so quickly that they never even make it to the webpages — and so that’s a very misleading way to measure how many come through a shelter versus other breeds,"" Battson said.

Veronica Chesse is the president and founder of Missouri Pitbull Rescue. She’s been working with the Kansas City pound for over 18 years. City animal shelters have to accept every dog brought to them, so Chesse’s organization takes in dogs to free up space there and give them a larger chance of being adopted. According to her, the Kansas City shelter is mostly full of pit bulls or pit bull type dogs. She had hoped that Kansas City’s mandatory spay and neuter law would reduce the shelter population, but in her experience that hasn’t been the case.

""I think they’re still completely overbred and very often owned by irresponsible people that are likely to mistreat them, abandon them, lose them and get them confiscated because they’re running free,"" Chesse said.

But what do the numbers say?

While Kansas City shelters may have a surplus of the breed, the same can’t be said for shelters statewide.

We talked to the animal shelters run by several cities, which are required to take in all breeds, to find out what percentage of pit bulls arrive in the shelters.

However, gathering accurate data on the number of pit bulls is difficult, since it’s often a challenge for shelters to properly categorize the dogs by breed.

Michelle Casey, the associate director of Columbia’s Central Missouri Humane Society, said her shelter is moving away from breed labeling and that many other shelters are doing the same thing. Without DNA testing, it’s impossible to accurately determine a dog’s genetic makeup based solely on appearance.

Pit bull isn’t really a breed; it is actually an umbrella term used to refer to several different breeds of dog. Merriam-Webster characterizes a pit bull as ""a muscular, short-haired, stocky dog (such as an American pit bull terrier or American Staffordshire terrier) of any of several breeds or a hybrid with one or more of these breeds that was originally developed for fighting and is noted for strength, stamina, and tenacity."" American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, Bull Terriers and Staffordshire Bull Terriers all fall under the umbrella term. Mixed breed dogs that have American Bulldog or Boxer lineage are also sometimes mischaracterized as pit bulls due to their blocky heads.

The shelters shared their data, but because it’s difficult to categorize the dogs, Casey made sure to clarify to us that even the data provided by the shelters needs to be taken with a grain of salt.

The Joplin animal shelter took in 3,429 dogs in 2018. Of these, 444 were recorded as pit bulls, making pit bulls 13 percent of the shelter population. The Sedalia animal shelter took in 992 dogs in 2018 — 204 of which were labeled as pit bulls — 21 percent of dogs.

Columbia took in 1,546 dogs and recorded 356 of these as pit bull type dogs, or 23 percent. This number doesn’t include dogs who have pit bull listed as a secondary breed.

The bottom line

Baker said 30 to 50 percent of dogs in shelters are pit bulls. He told us he was going by animal shelter webpages he has seen. Shelters say that is not an accurate way to gauge the percentage of pit bulls compared to other dogs in a shelter, because some dog breeds are adopted more quickly and never appear on websites. In addition, it is also difficult to obtain an accurate percentage as pit bull is an umbrella term that encompasses dogs of a certain body type rather than a specific breed.

Our research found that city shelters around the state are seeing 15 to 20 percent of shelter dogs as pit bulls, but it is challenging to define which dogs are pit bulls because the definition is broad. We decided not to rate this statement, as the data available to us is too weak for a definitive ruling."

It seemed surprising that Vescovo’s information would be released through a Sunshine request of the Jefferson County Port Authority. So we reached out to Vescovo to learn more.

Vescovo served on the executive board of the Port Authority from 2011 to 2015. He didn’t have a record of the documents released, so we reached out to the Port Authority.

Neal Breitweiser, its current executive director, was concerned about the allegations against his organization. Vescovo’s service on the Port Authority was before Breitweiser was appointed to his current position.

After speaking with the current president and vice president of the Port Authority, Breitweiser confirmed that Vescovo’s information was released, but he didn’t have the documents in Port Authority records.

The Jefferson County Port Authority was originally under the command of the Economic Development Corporation of Jefferson County, and the mistake was during that time.

Vescovo specifically cited Aaron Malin in the tweet as the requester of records. Malin is a St. Louis-based activist and recent graduate of the University of Denver law school. When we reached Malin via Facebook, he said he didn’t have records dating back that far. However, he had no memory of any records violating the law by releasing sensitive information.

""If I ever had his personal information, I no longer have it,"" Malin said over Facebook Messenger. ""I’ve submitted nearly 1,000 Sunshine requests over the last eight years…I can’t confirm that I never saw such a mistake. If I did notice disclosure of sensitive personal information, yes, I’d notify the custodian of records, and I would delete the information from the records.""

Malin has submitted Sunshine requests all over Missouri, mostly to police departments and other enforcement programs to learn about drug enforcement. He says he doesn’t remember exactly why he requested Port Authority information.

Politicizing the Sunshine Law

Finally, we wanted to explore a bit more about Vescovo’s support of an idea to allow lawmakers to exempt certain files from Sunshine laws. The law specifies a ""constituent case file"" as ""any correspondence, written or electronic, between a member and a constituent, or between a member and any other party pertaining to a constituent’s grievance, a question of eligibility for any benefit as it relates to a particular constituent, or any issue regarding a constituent’s request for assistance.""

Dave Roland, director of the Freedom Center of Missouri, a non-profit law firm dedicated to protecting individual freedoms in Missouri, explained that Vescovo’s tweet was initially in response to the arguments that Clean Missouri’s new stipulations would put constituents’ personal information at risk. Sometimes, when constituents contact lawmakers about an issue they have with the laws in their district, they share personal information, such as their Medicaid coverage or other sensitive information.

However, Roland argues the state is ""using a bazooka to kill a fly."" Instead of crafting a reasonable exemption to protect individual citizens’ correspondence that contains sensitive facts, some in the state legislature want to exempt a huge swath of records.

The amendment allows a representative to redact anything that, in their opinion, might put shared information at risk.

""The amendments weren’t subject to public hearings (when they were drafted),"" Roland continues. ""Citizens need to know how government officials are making decisions. It’s dangerous to cut off opportunities for citizens to find out."""

In the case of writer David French and The National Review, MU is a cautionary tale about what happens when student activists are too loud — enrollment, finances and tradition suffer.

In his Oct. 25 National Review essay, French contends the 2015 MU protesters were overreacting to what was happening around them or were reacting for reasons separate from racial justice.

""It’s worth pondering the lessons of arguably the most consequential campus protests since the Vietnam era,"" he wrote. ""A flagship public university of a red state capitulated to unreasonable, far-left demands, and it paid a terrible price.""

French made one claim that caught our eye: ""Before and after the protests, (the university) bent over backwards to increase student and faculty diversity.""

We reached out to French and MU spokesperson Liz McCune and scoured the public record to see what MU has done and is doing regarding faculty diversity.

It’s difficult to nail down what exactly ""bent over backwards"" means, so we decided not to put the statement on the Truth-O-Meter. But there is pertinent information to contextualize French's statement.

Faculty diversity at MU

In the fall of 2015, activist group Concerned Student 1950 called for increasing the percentage of black faculty and staff at MU to 10 percent by academic year 2017-18. The city of Columbia is about 10 percent black; the University of Missouri student body is about 7 percent black.

And while MU has indeed taken measures to increase faculty diversity, faculty diversity has hardly increased. In 2015, black faculty was slightly less than 3 percent. The most recent data (2017) shows that 3.3 percent of MU’s faculty is black — 65 faculty members out of 1,969. Additionally, 44 percent of non-black faculty have tenure, while 22 percent of black faculty have tenure.

In a November 2015 op-ed for the Huffington Post, nine MU faculty members, who identified themselves as ""a group of faculty of color who were previously employed as tenured or tenure-track faculty at the University of Missouri, Columbia (MU) and have since left the institution,"" highlighted 10 problems faculty of color face at MU.

The letter charges MU with having done little to help current faculty of color and increase faculty diversity leading up to the protests of that fall.

Among the issues the nine professors emphasized included the struggle for a diversity course requirement, racism among peers in the city and at the school, scarce opportunities for advancement, the alienation of ""being the only, or one of a few, faculty of color in a department"" and retainment.

We checked news articles from the time to get more of the lay of the land. A 2015 St. Louis Post-Dispatch article speaks to what MU did before the 2015 protests, accounting for several instances when MU started and stopped in attempts to confront issues of race on campus. In 2002, the article said, ""A recommendation that undergraduates would be required to take a diversity course was ‘turned down flat’ … "" The article goes on to detail the Faculty Council Committee on Race Relations that started in May 2015, another initiative meant to name problems on race and find solutions.

This year, the American Council on Education’s Center for Policy Research and Strategy published a study reviewing MU’s performance when handling the 2015 protests in particular and race on campus in general. The study acknowledges MU’s ""long history of … declining to address racial incidents on campus.""

For faculty diversity, the study states, ""The university, like other institutions across our nation, has struggled with the hiring (e.g., obtaining a diverse candidate pool as well as getting search committees to hire candidates in the pool) and retaining of new faculty and staff of color.""

Addressing the problem

French wrote in a Twitter direct message that the 2006 Chancellor’s Diversity Initiative was an indication of MU handling this issue of faculty diversity. He also mentioned MU’s hiring of a chief diversity officer, a position the university created in response to the 2015 protests and filled in 2016 with Kevin McDonald.

French brought up a 2010 MU News Bureau (the university’s publishing arm) story that announced the hiring of 15 underrepresented minority faculty. French also focused on the School of Education’s various diversity initiatives; one of the goals is increasing diversity among faculty. Finally, French sent a link to MU’s office of Inclusion, Diversity & Equity's webpage.The Division of Inclusion, Diversity & Equity writes that they measure their progress by regularly studying campus climate.

Other efforts that French didn’t touch upon are MU’s allocation of $600,000 for recruitment and retainment of underrepresented faculty and $1 million for recruitment of minority postdoctoral fellows. This occurred after the 2015 protests.

MU spokeswoman Liz McCune wrote in an email that ""in the early 2000s, the university set aside funds meant to incentivize departments to hire diverse candidates.""

""From 2005 to 2015, non-white faculty increased 51 percent, from 352 in 2005 to 535 in 2015,"" she continued. ""During the same time, white faculty only increased 10 percent, from 1,337 to 1,476.""

McCune went on to mention the Eminent Scholars Program at MU meant to ""help faculty of color and women connect with national mentors in their field of study."" This was created after the protests.

The big picture

In commenting on the aftermath of the 2015 protests at MU, David French wrote: ""Before and after the protests, (the university) bent over backwards to increase student and faculty diversity."""

The state is the 33rd to legalize marijuana in some form, but there are still several questions regarding the practical implementation of the state constitutional amendment, especially where it runs up against federal law.

A Nov. 12 tweet from the Missouri Libertarian Party raised the issue of legal gun purchasing for those who use medical marijuana.

https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/oct/29/how-bad-will-soybean-farmers-be-year/,2018-10-29T00:00:00,How bad off will soybean farmers be this year?,"Sen. Claire McCaskill doesn’t care for the president’s trade fight with China. She made that clear in her second debate against Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley on Oct. 18.

McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent, framed Trump’s tariffs as the main reason for the struggles of Missouri’s soybean farmers.

""Our economy is so dependent on the exporting of agricultural goods. These tariffs have killed commodity prices. There's not a bean farmer in Missouri that's going to come out even this year,"" McCaskill said.

Soybeans are indeed a big deal in Missouri. In 2016, soybeans were the state’s biggest agricultural export, according to the Missouri Department of Agriculture. In 2012, more acres were dedicated to soybean farming in Missouri than any other crop, according to the most recent U.S. Census of Agriculture data from that year.

One of the stiffest retaliatory measures China has taken in response to U.S. tariffs is a 25 percent tax on American soybeans. It is typical for roughly one in every three rows of soybean produced in Missouri to be exported to China annually, according to Missouri Soybean Farmer magazine.

Our ears perked up at the sweeping nature of McCaskill’s statement — is it true that, thanks to Trump's tariffs, no soybean farmer will end up in the black this year?

Since the statement is a prediction and we won’t know for sure until the year is up, we decided to not apply a rating to this statement — hence the lack of a Truth-o-Meter rating at the end of this article.

Still, with tariffs, agriculture and the economy dominating a fair chunk of campaign rhetoric ahead of Missouri’s election, we decided it was worth taking a closer look.

Let’s talk tariffs

Since the tariffs were announced in June, the going rate for U.S. soybeans has fallen from roughly $10.50 to $8.46 a bushel as of Oct. 21, according to Markets Insider.

Across the country, production of soybeans is up 6.9 percent over 2017, according to the University of Missouri Food and Agricultural Policy Research Center. But the total value of America’s 2018 soybean crop is actually $700 million less than last year due to the drop in price per bushel, according to the same data.

Patrick Westhoff, director of the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, said that while it is difficult to attribute economic trends to any one factor, the tariffs certainly deserve blame for these dropping soybean prices, and that has been reflected in farmers’ bottom lines.

""Yes, it has affected U.S. prices. Certainly, the lower prices have reduced income levels for every producer,"" Westhoff said, adding that a Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute report from August projected the market year average price at $8.73 per soybean bushel, the lowest since 2006.

""Prices are down roughly 20 percent over the last six months,"" said Christine Tew, director of communications for the Missouri Soybean Association.

Compounding the tariff pinch in Missouri is the state’s below-average yearly yield for soybeans, Westhoff said.

Taken together, the tariff-induced price drop and a 2018 Missouri soybean yield that’s 7 percent smaller than 2017 have combined for a loss of $319 million in crop value, according to the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute.

An MU Extension simulation from July 2018 calculated the ""ripple effect"" a 10-cent drop in soybean bushel price would have on Missouri’s economy. Missouri Soybean Farmer magazine extrapolated the study to a $2 drop — roughly equivalent to the actual decline since June — and found an expected effect of ""more than $212 million in lost earnings for workers and business owners, and 3,000 fewer jobs.""

McCaskill’s campaign Communications Director Meira Bernstein referenced this simulation as well as multiple articles as evidence for the Senator’s claim.

One was a St. Louis Public Radio story from early July of this year in which Missouri Soybean Association President C. Brooks Hurst is quoted as saying, ""When you’ve lost 15 percent off your price, you gotta understand, that’s like, all of our profit. So all of us have gone from maybe a small profit in that field of soybeans we planted to now just basically hoping to break even.""

Bernstein also pointed to a St. Louis roundtable McCaskill held in August with Missouri farmers and businesses affected by the tariffs. In a transcript of the meeting, former president and current Missouri Soybean Association board member Mike McCrate said: ""So I looked on the way up here, Lansing Grain was at 7.70 for November delivery. Break even in the Bootheel, 45 bushel average, is $10.50, so we're literally going to be manufacturing below cost.""

Government to the rescue

OK, so lower prices and yields are affecting soybean farmers in Missouri and across the country. But will they all lose money on the year? Turns out, it may not be all doom and gloom.

One of the relief programs announced by the USDA in late August is the Market Facilitation Program. This program offers a payout of $1.65 per bushel of soybeans on 50 percent of a farmer's crop, up to a maximum payout of $125,000.

According to a Food and Agricultural Policy Research projection, the initial Market Facilitation Program payments will add back roughly 9 percent to both the Missouri soybean crop value and the nation’s total crop value, with the possibility of a second round of payments to be announced in December.

After factoring in these government payments, Missouri’s soybean crop value for 2018 is only 7 percent less than in 2017 — a year featuring a larger state yield and no Chinese tariffs. Nationwide, factoring the payments in actually pushes the 2018 soybean crop value above that of 2017, even with the tariffs in place.

Additionally, the USDA has allocated $200 million for its Agricultural Trade Promotion Program, designed to help American farmers find new markets abroad and ""mitigate the adverse effects of other countries’ restrictions,"" like China.

The big picture

Clearly, the situation is quite bleak for Missouri soybean farmers, and the tariffs deserve much of the blame.

Attributing this hardship entirely to the president’s trade policies, though, is difficult.

For one, fewer soybeans were produced in the state this year than in 2017. With fewer beans to take to market, farmers have less product to sell and thus less money to make.

Government programs are in place to mitigate losses, however insufficient McCaskill or others feel they are. According to Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute figures, if fully doled out, this aid will close much of the gap in Missouri."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/oct/25/claire-mccaskill-josh-hawley-argue-over-immigratio/,2018-10-25T00:00:00,"Claire McCaskill, Josh Hawley argue over immigration, taxes in final Senate debate","KANSAS CITY — The last U.S. Senate debate between Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley began with a question about civility in the campaign. Hawley said he’d never attacked McCaskill personally. The senator objected.

And so it went.

The two candidates spent most of the hour-long debate at KMBC television station battling over their public service records and their views on immigration, gun control, gay rights, health care and the economy, among other topics.

What’s personal is in the eye of the beholder, but facts are not. We looked into many of their statements during the debate, some of which were new, some of which they’d said previously, in an attempt to offer a full and honest picture.

McCaskill: Says Hawley ""said four-year degrees are worthless at one point.""

Hawley’s stump speech typically includes the word ""worthless"" to characterize four-year colleges.

""I never said that degrees were worthless. I said that four-year colleges increasingly turn out degrees that can be worthless,"" Hawley said when McCaskill quoted him.

Hawley has been quoted calling four-year degrees ""increasingly worthless"" many times, including in the Kansas City Star on Sept. 2, the Columbia Daily Tribune on May 10, and on KTRS’ The McGraw Show on May 29.

During Thursday’s debate, Hawley proposed an alternative to the four-year system, which both candidates agreed incurs too much debt. ""I think we ought to allow federal student loan dollars to follow people into apprenticeships and job training programs,"" Hawley said. ""I don’t think you have to have an expensive four-year degree to get a good job, or to get some respect in this country.""

— Theo DeRosa

Hawley: ""Senator (McCaskill), you called the middle-class tax cuts scraps. Missouri families are saving 1,200 more dollars, average Missouri families.""

She did use the word, in the context of saying Missourians deserved more. In a statement she released after voting against the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, she said, ""working people in Missouri deserve better than to get scraps, while corporations and wealthy business owners make out like bandits.

The Hawley campaign did not respond to our inquiry about the source of the $1,200 savings. PolitiFact rated a similar statement from House Speaker Paul Ryan about the average family’s savings as Half True. Ryan’s estimate was based on a plausible calculation but glossed over some context. It didn’t factor in several itemized deductions that would disappear and that could have a significant impact on at least some typical families. Finally, the savings would only come in the first year, and then the benefits start to shrink before turning into a tax hike.

In evaluating Hawley’s claim, John Buhl of the Tax Foundation pointed us to a state-by-state breakdown of estimated after-tax income changes due to the tax plan for a middle-income family. For Missouri, that estimated increase was $605.

Buhl also pointed us to a report along the same lines from the conservative Heritage Foundation that shows the average savings for 2018 for all Missouri filers at $1,014.

McCaskill: ""Zero felonies in Missouri have been filed"" from search warrants looking for human trafficking evidence in Springfield massage businesses.

McCaskill portrayed Hawley’s tenure as attorney general as ineffective, spotlighting a July 2017 multi-state human trafficking investigation. We could not find any felony charges filed from his office through a search of online court records.

Hawley’s team executed search warrants that July of 13 massage businesses in Springfield, looking for evidence of human trafficking.

A day after the search, nine people were charged with a misdemeanor for not having the proper license to operate a massage business, according to online court records. These seem to be the only criminal charges filed from Greene County.

The Springfield News-Leader, about a year later, reported that there still haven’t been any felonies charged as of Feb. 18. Hawley’s office told the News-Leader then that there would be ""further action in days to come.""

But a search through online court records in the later weeks revealed nothing. Neither Hawley’s office nor his campaign responded to a request for comment by deadline.

In Louisiana, the state attorney general filed human trafficking charges against Bingbing Li and Linan Tian, who also owned Palm Spa in Springfield.

Hawley: Says McCaskill ""voted to raise taxes or fees 200 times in her 12-year career in the United States Senate.""

The figure Hawley cites double counts votes and includes votes against tax cuts, which is not the same as raising taxes.

The website ClaireMctaxall.com, paid for by Hawley’s campaign, contains a list of supposed instances where McCaskill voted to increase taxes. When we reached out to them for comment they only replied with a link to this website.

The website includes 19 votes for tax increases we could identify. Here are some examples:

• The Consumer First Energy Act of 2008 that ""impose[d] a windfall profits tax on major integrated oil companies.""

• The FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act that ""excise[d] taxes on aviation fuels and air transportation of persons and property"" to raise revenue for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund.

• The Middle Class Tax Cuts Act that taxed individuals ""3.25% of so much of their modified adjusted gross income as exceeds $1 million.""

It’s important to note that most taxes cited were on things like corporations, oil companies and airlines, as opposed to the typical American.

The list includes many instances where McCaskill voted against tax cuts, voted against renewing a tax, or voted to make it more difficult to repeal taxes. None of these are the same as raising taxes; they would instead maintain or decrease the amount of taxes.

The other issue with this list is that several bills are counted twice, because that legislation required multiple votes and revisions to reach a majority. Of the 19 votes McCaskill cast to raise taxes on this list, six were repeated measures.

— Dylan Sherman and Hannah Archambault

McCaskill: ""The Republicans had it backwards. They made the rich people’s tax cuts permanent. They made the middle-class tax cuts temporary. I'd like to flip those.""

To get around Senate rules and pass the tax cut in 2017, Republicans had to set several of the tax bill’s provisions to expires.

An analysis by the nonpartisan think tank Tax Policy Center, released shortly before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December, found that the bill would reduce taxes on average for all income groups.

However, the center also found that ""higher income households receive larger average tax cuts as a percentage of after-tax income, with the largest cuts as a share of income going to taxpayers in the 95th to 99th percentiles of the income distribution. ""

As we've noted before, every income group on average would pay less in taxes in 2019, according to a nonpartisan analysis of the final tax bill by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.

But this doesn't mean that every single taxpayer in each income group will get a tax cut. However, at least early on, there will be far more winners than losers in every income group. For all but the top 1 percent of earners, no income group studied by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center has more than 7.6 percent of its members losing ground under the tax bill in 2018.

Over time, these broad-based tax cuts dissipate, however, due to the sunsetting of some key tax credits and a change in how inflation is calculated. That's the point McCaskill was trying to make.

By 2027, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, every income group below $75,000 will actually see a tax increase. Only those income ranges above $75,000 will still see a cut by 2027. And according to the Tax Policy Center, only taxpayers higher than the 90th percentile -- that is, those earning about $225,000 and above -- will have better-than-even odds of getting a tax cut in 2027.

That's a significantly different pattern than in the bill's early years.

Hawley: McCaskill ""has repeatedly voted against border security funding, she has voted for amnesty for illegal aliens, and she is currently sponsoring the most radical open border bill ever introduced in the United States Congress."" Hawley also said McCaskill called President Trump’s border wall ""embarrassing.""

Voted against border security funding: Sometimes. In 2010, McCaskill and Sen. Chuck Schumer fought for $600 million in supplemental money for ""1,500 new border personnel, a pair of unmanned drones and military-style bases along the border,"" according to Politico. McCaskill voted for 700 more miles of fencing to be built along the Mexican-American border in 2009, thereby increasing funding. And in 2018, McCaskill was a proponent of a plan that sought to allocate $25 billion for a border wall. But she voted no on a similar bill supported by Trump soon after.

Voted for amnesty for illegal aliens: This is not the whole truth. In 2013, McCaskill voted yes on a bill that would have provided immigrants who lived in the country without documentation a path to citizenship. But the bill, which included border security dollars, involved a $500 fine and an application for six-year provisional status. Permanent legal status could only be achieved after 10 years, a $1,000 fine and learning English.

Supporting radical open borders bill: We rated this False in an earlier fact-check. The Keep Families Together Act does not reduce border protection, nor does it offer special protection to immigrants who cross the border without documentation.

She called Trump's border wall ""embarrassing:"" At a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee meeting last year, McCaskill said: ""The sooner we stop this, ‘we’re going to build a wall from sea to shining sea and the Mexicans are going to pay for it’ — it’s embarrassing,"" McCaskill said. ""It’s not going to happen. Everybody in Congress knows it’s not going to happen.""

Hawley: ""We have a national background check system that currently has a huge loophole, it does not include mental health records ... Sen. McCaskill has voted against that.""

This talking point is misleading. Hawley was referencing McCaskill’s vote against a 2016 amendment (SA 4751) to the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, would have incentivized states to submit relevant mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

McCaskill joined a majority of Democrats against the measure, which failed to get the 60 votes needed to pass.

That vote doesn’t tell the full story of McCaskill’s actions on legislation involving background checks for gun purchases.

McCaskill did vote for another amendment to the appropriations act (SA 4750) co-sponsored by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., known as the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2016. Its purpose was to ensure ""all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a firearm are listed in the national instant criminal background check system and require a background check for every firearm sale,"" and it gave specific provisions for defining mental health records. The Murphy amendment did not pass, either.

Over 12 years in the Senate, McCaskill has also favored other legislation aimed at strengthening the background check system and the inclusion of mental health records, including votes for the 2007 NICS Improvement Act and the failed Manchin-Toomey amendment of 2013 and co-sponsorship of the 2017 Fix NICS Act.

McCaskillL ""Border Patrol agents have endorsed me in this race.""

There’s a slight difference: The Border Patrol agents union has indeed endorsed McCaskill. As the National Border Patrol Council, a union representing around 18,000 border patrol agents, wrote in a September 2018 op-ed: ""In 2018, we endorsed Donald Trump for president because he was tough on borders and strong on enforcement. We’re endorsing Claire McCaskill now for the exact same reasons.""

— Sten Spinella

Hawley: ""We don’t have to have the 159 new agencies under Obamacare. You don’t have to have the 20 new federal taxes for it. ""

These talking points are old, and misleading.

Hawley is correct that Obamacare resulted in the creation of ""dozens of new entities to implement the legislation,"" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2010 looking at just that.

But the same report explicitly debunks an article ""which lists 159 ‘new boards and commissions created under the new health care law.’ Many of the listed ‘boards and commissions’ are actually grants, demonstration or pilot projects, and programs,"" CRS said.

As for the 20 taxes, PolitiFact investigated a similar claim about in 2012. We found then that characterizing these price hikes as ""taxes"" is misleading. Some are fees on health insurance providers proportionate to their share of the market, as well as fees for importers and manufacturers of branded drugs. But others are mandates or penalties, such as penalty for companies with more than 50 employees who do not offer ""adequate"" health insurance.

— Andrew Withers

McCaskill: ""I know the tax cut has not produced what they promised. It hasn’t paid for itself. Our deficit is up, our revenues are down in a strong economic climate.""

McCaskill’s statement holds some truth. Since the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the nominal dollars, or the actual amount of money spent in a period of time, have increased by less than half a percent, one of the weakest increases since World War II. When factoring in inflation, tax revenue actually decreased by 1.6 percent.

Correction Oct. 26, 2018: A previous version of this story wrongly described what provisions of the 2017 tax bill would sunset."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/oct/19/fact-checking-missouri-debate-between-josh-hawley-/,2018-10-19T00:00:00,"Fact-checking the first televised Missouri Senate debate between Josh Hawley, Claire McCaskill","Republican Josh Hawley embraced the policies of President Donald Trump and criticized Democrat incumbent Claire McCaskill for a brand of ""party-line liberalism"" that is out-of-step with Missouri voters during Thursday’s televised Senate debate.

""It’s just the party line over and over and over,"" Hawley said during an hour-long debate, moderated by PBS’s Judy Woodruff.

McCaskill claimed the exact opposite, painting herself as someone who has worked with Republicans to get things done in two terms in Washington.

""Campaigns are a time that we highlight differences, but I think they should also be a time that voters take a hard look at which candidate can do more than criticize their opponent, who can actually find common ground,"" McCaskill said. ""I’m very proud of what I’ve gotten done in the Senate.""

The race in Missouri has clear national implications. Republicans in the Senate control a slim 51-49 majority, but Democrats need to hold onto 10 seats in states President Donald Trump won in 2016, in addition to flipping two others. Trump won Missouri two years ago by nearly 20 percentage points.

PolitiFact Missouri fact-checked claims from both candidates that were either misleading, or needed additional context.

McCaskill: ""These tariffs have killed commodity prices. There's not a bean farmer in Missouri that's going to come out even this year.""

McCaskill isn’t far off in characterizing the situation as grim for Missouri farmers. Attributing that entirely to Trump’s tariffs, though, is an exaggeration.

For context, it’s true that the price of soybeans — which undoubtedly has an effect on whether Missouri soybean farmers turn a profit — has been dropping: a University of Missouri Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute report from August projected the market year average price at $8.73 per soybean bushel, the lowest since 2006.

While tariff-induced smaller prices have had an impact on profits, so have smaller yields.

For example, this year’s Missouri soybean harvest is 7 percent smaller than 2017’s, according to the Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute.

Help also exists for farmers who are struggling. The USDA has instituted an aid program known as the Market Facilitation Program to provide relief to farmers proportional to their yield size. McCaskill called this program insufficient.

Hawley: ""Sen. McCaskill takes more money than anybody in Congress from the insurance industry except for one other liberal.""

This is a largely accurate claim that Hawley has made before, one based on a ranking by OpenSecrets.org. An update of the report places McCaskill third overall.

It’s important to know the numbers are based on all insurance companies, not just health care.

— Hannah Archambault

McCaskill: ""Wages are stagnant. In fact, wages are 1.8 percent lower in this country than they were a year ago.""

McCaskill’s statistic doesn’t come from a government source, rather from data from the PayScale Index, a calculation made by a private group. It’s also out of date.

The PayScale index showed a drop in wages of 1.8 percent between the first and second quarters of 2018. The PayScale index showed a smaller dip between the second and third quarters of 2018.

But that data is at odds with official government data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS released new data Oct. 16 showing that median weekly earnings have increased in each of the first three quarters of 2018. In inflation-adjusted dollars, median weekly earnings have increased from $350 weekly to $355 weekly so far in 2018. That’s an increase of 1.4 percent, not a decrease of 1.8 percent as McCaskill said.

Other BLS measurements of wages follow a similar upward trend.

Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, told us for a similar fact-check in July: ""I don’t think there’s any evidence I would trust that inflation-adjusted wages have declined noticeably, either over the entire Trump administration or in the period since Congress passed the new tax law,"" Burtless said.

Hawley: McCaskill ""voted no on the tax cut. She wants to reverse it and raise your taxes, raise middle-class taxes.""

Hawley’s claim is misleading. McCaskill did vote against the 2017 tax cut bill championed by Trump and Republicans. But McCaskill said she opposed the proposal because she believe it disproportionately benefited wealthier Americans.

""I wanted to support real tax reform. This isn’t it — this is a bad deal for Missouri families,"" McCaskill said in a statement after her vote. ""Working people in Missouri deserve better than to get scraps, while corporations and wealthy business owners make out like bandits.""

McCaskill also has not called for fully repealing, or reversing the tax cut bill. She said she would ""never vote to repeal the parts that help middle-class families.""

— Matthew Hall

McCaskill: In Hawley’s first campaign, Hawley ""said that his campaign was funded almost entirely by the biggest right to work advocate in the state. 75 percent. Over $4 million.""

The advocate she referenced is David Humphreys, CEO and president of the Joplin-based business Tamko Building Products, Inc. He has been an avid supporter and donor of Republican candidates advocating for the ""right to work"" movement, which advocates against employees being required to join a union.

Humphreys, his family and associates of Tamko Building Products, Inc. donated over $4.5 million for Josh Hawley’s successful attorney general campaign in 2016, which made up approximately 75 percent of individual contributions, according to KOMU .

Hawley’s run for Senate has drawn over $2 million from Humphreys as well to various Hawley-supporting Super PACS including Missouri Rising Action and CFG Action Missouri. The Hawley-supporting Super PACs include Missouri Rising Action and CFG Action Missouri, according to the Federal Election Commission.

Hawley: McCaskill ""voted to cut $716 billion from Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare.""

The claim is too sweeping by implying cuts to current benefits. For years, PolitiFact has been skeptical of numerous previous claims that Obamacare cuts Medicare.

Medicare spending continues to rise, but it will climb at a slower pace than without the law. The law reduced future spending for Medicare by targeting reductions in payments to health care providers. The spending reductions come in the form of reduced payments to providers of health care, such as hospitals and insurance companies.

— Dylan Sherman

McCaskill: ""I just voted for — along with President Trump, agreeing with President Trump — that we needed a big increase to our military budget.""

McCaskill is likely referencing her vote on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. The bill passed the Senate in August 87-10, with only seven Democrats opposing the bill. The budget provides $717 billion to fund the military, an increase of nearly 10 percent. The budget also includes a 2.6 percent wage increase to military personnel.

Trump called the budget increase ""one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history."" It’s not.

— Dylan Sherman

McCaskill: ""I have certainly voted and worked on a bill that would have given $25 billion towards border security.""

McCaskill did support a proposal called the so-called ""Common Sense Plan,"" or the Broader Options for America Act, that would have put $25 billion toward ""the construction of physical barriers, border security technologies, and tactical infrastructure.""

But it’s important to note that plan would also have implemented a path to citizenship for ""dreamers"" who were brought illegally to the United States as minors. It failed in the Senate and was opposed by a majority of Republicans.

McCaskill voted against a bill sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that among other things, would have funded a border wall. As PolitiFact has reported reported, the legislation included other elements of Trump’s immigration agenda, including tighter curbs on legal immigration, that made it unpalatable to most Democrats."" It failed in the Senate because it could not garner the 60 votes needed to pass.

McCaskill: ""According to an independent group, I am the fifth-most likely senator to break with my party.""

McCaskill is right up there. Campaign spokesman Eric Mee cited a February 2018 analysis released by the nonpartisan Congressional Quarterly magazine. It stated that in 2017, McCaskill was among the top five most independent senators, voting against her party majority 18 percent of the time.

According to a wider time period in a ProPublica database, McCaskill is the 10th-most likely U.S. senator of the 115th Congress (Jan 3, 2017 - present) to vote against party line, voting against the Democratic majority 16.9 percent of the time.

— Kathryn Palmer

Hawley: McCaskill voted with ""with Chuck Schumer 90 percent of the time.""

McCaskill: ""And President Trump 50 percent of the time.""

Their numbers aren’t far off.

According to ProPublica’s ""Head to Head"" tool that compares lawmakers’ voting records, McCaskill agreed with Democrats and Schumer, the Senate minority leader, on 80 percent of votes in 2017-18. Out of 548 votes, they have disagreed on 107, according to ProPublica. She broke with Schumer on six major votes, including on the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state and on the passage of a joint resolution disapproving a rule known as the Stream Protection Rule.

In 2015-16, the two agreed on 84 percent of votes, and the year before that agreed on 94 percent of votes, according to ProPublica.

McCaskill voted with Trump on 58 percent of certain votes in 2017, according to Congressional Quarterly’s annual voting study. By comparison, she voted with Democratic President Barack Obama between 92 and 100 percent of the time during his eight years in office.

https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2017/dec/21/missouri-informed-consent-laws-found-conflicting-c/,2017-12-21T00:00:00,"Missouri informed consent laws found conflicting, controversial and inconclusive","During the summer of 2017, the Missouri legislature passed a bill that changed the state’s abortion laws. Exactly what it means is still in dispute.

Sen. Bob Onder, R-St. Charles County, tweeted, ""It only takes the Missouri consent laws back to where they were in 2010.""

Does it?

In 2010, there was a 24-hour waiting period for women who ask for an abortion.

The 2017 law makes it 72 hours.

So, Onder is wrong on that count. When we asked him about his tweet, he told us, ""The issue, of course, is the requirement that the physician to perform the abortion meet the patient and engage in the informed consent personally.""

And that’s where the language gets complicated and even conflicting. In fact, we’re withholding a rating on the Truth-O-Meter. But our research helps explain what’s going on.

Court action

After the legislation was signed by Gov. Eric Greitens in July, Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union petitioned for a temporary restraining order over specific portions of the bill that deal with a patient’s informed consent before an abortion.

That bill, SB5, stated: ""The physician who is to perform or induce the abortion shall, at least seventy-two hours prior to such procedure, inform the woman orally and in person"" of risks associated with her procedure.

Planned Parenthood argued this imposes an ""extreme and unprecedented set of requirements"" on Missouri women and their physicians, and restricts women’s access to abortion services. But Republican supporters say it’s reverting the state to earlier rules.

In October, a Jackson County judge denied the restraining order request.

Informed consent law in 2010

Onder pointed us to a specific section of statute in Missouri law. Prior to 2010, that line specified that ""a treating physician"" must be the one to provide informed consent information. In 2010, the language in that same section of the bill was amended to instead require the patient to have a conference with ""the physician who is to perform"" the abortion or a ""qualified professional.""

""My point was that pre-2010, it was the physician who was to perform the abortion required to administer informed consent,"" Onder said in an email. ""And SB 5 returns the law to that requirement.""

But did Missouri law actually require the performing physician to provide informed consent in 2010? That depends on how you interpret what ""a treating physician"" is. Onder said that a treating physician was always ""understood to mean that the physician who provided informed consent was the same physician who was to perform the abortion.""

Lawyers aren’t so quick to confirm that. We reached out to multiple clinical lawyers who said the definition of ""a treating physician"" is not entirely clear in this case.

Jesse Lawder, vice president of marketing and communications for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, interprets this clause of the statute as ""a"" treating physician, which is different than ""the"" treating physician who is the person to perform or induce the abortion.

This isn’t the only problem Planned Parenthood has with the newest changes to Missouri abortion law.

Informed consent law in 2017

Planned Parenthood claims that, thanks to changes made during the 2017 special session, Missouri’s abortion statute now contradicts itself when it comes to who must provide informed consent.

The Missouri legislature amended the line of statute Onder pointed us to during the 2017 special session to include a ""referring physician"" in the list of people who could provide informed consent. But in addition to that line, the Missouri legislature also added a brand new chunk of language in another section of the state’s abortion statute.

That language reads, ""The physician who is to perform or induce the abortion shall, at least seventy-two hours prior to such procedure, inform the woman orally and in person.""

So, in one section of statute, section 188.039, there’s a requirement that ""the physician who is to perform or induce the abortion, a qualified professional or the referring physician"" must confer with the patient, and in another, section 188.027 there’s a requirement that the physician who is to perform or induce the abortion explicitly provide informed consent info.

Onder doesn’t see a problem with this.

""Nothing in section 188.027 contradicts section 188.039,"" Onder said.

The judge in October said the argument that the law was contradictory, along with several other attempts to block the law, failed to ""meet the court’s high bar for granting a preliminary injunction.""

As a result, the new abortion laws went into effect on Oct. 24, 2017.

In summation

Onder stated that changes made to state statute during the 2017 special session on abortion law, ""only takes the Missouri informed consent laws back to where they were in 2010.""

There’s a difference between 24 hours and 72 hours for the waiting period. But the tricky part between 2010 and 2017 lies in the difference between a treating physician and the treating physician. Also, a different part of the 2017 bill refers to who must inform the patient in different ways."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2017/nov/12/chappelle-nadal-right-when-she-says-radioactive-wa/,2017-11-12T00:00:00,Is Chappelle-Nadal right when she says 'radioactive waste is killing our residents?',"On Oct. 19, a group of residents from north St. Louis County met with the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss health concerns. The town of Bridgeton is also home to the West Lake Landfill, which has been getting a lot of attention from Missouri Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal.

Chappelle-Nadal, a Democrat, has been vocal about radioactive waste problems in her district since she was first elected to the Missouri Senate back in 2010.

On Aug. 11, Chappelle-Nadal announced via a Facebook post, ""Radioactive waste is killing our residents.""

We wanted to see evidence of whether radioactive waste is killing residents in Bridgeton. What we found isn’t completely convincing one way or the other, so we’ll withhold a rating on the Truth-O-Meter. But our research still helps explain what’s going on.

What is happening?

Although Chappelle-Nadal did not respond to a request for evidence to this claim, we know she is referring to two different incidents near the West Lake Landfill in Bridgeton.

The first incident is an underground fire burning within an area of the West Lake Landfill, according to a nine-page report released in 2015 by then-Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster. The fire is only separated from nuclear waste by a little over 1,000 feet. The fire has been burning since 2010, and although this is an issue that has been cause for safety discussion in the past, it isn’t directly affecting any residents’ health, at least not until the fire meets any radioactive waste.

When Chappelle-Nadal discussed residents dying of cancers, she is directly referring to the residential area around the West Lake Landfill.

The site, which was historically used for agriculture, became contaminated with waste in 1973 according to a report by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Waste material, coming from Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, contained approximately 8,700 tons of leached barium sulfate cake residue. This material, mixed with 39,000 tons of soil, was disposed of at the site.

Is it safe?

Republic Services, the waste management company that owns the landfill, said multiple times that the landfill is safe and that it has done everything the Environmental Protection Agency has asked of it.

However, residents of Bridgeton disagree. Residents of Bridgeton and EPA officials discussed the safety of the West Lake Landfill at a meeting on Oct. 19.

Residents argued the radiation exposure from the landfill was causing health issues and called for the removal of the radioactive waste, said Ed Smith, policy director of the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, who attended the meeting.

""The site has been determined as an EPA Superfund site, which means doing nothing will present an unacceptable risk to the public health,"" Smith said.

A Superfund site is an area that requires a long-term response to clean up hazardous material. These locations are placed on the EPA’s National Priorities List. As of February 2014, there were 1,322 Superfund sites nationwide, including 38 in Missouri, according to the EPA’s website.

Jeffrey Dimond, a spokesman for the registry, pointed us to an Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry report about the safety of West Lake Landfill that was released in 2015. In it, the agency ""reviewed groundwater, air, and soil data from the West Lake Landfill to determine whether the site posed a threat to the health of the public.""

While on-site groundwater was found to have potential effects, off-site water, the agency found, did not have a complete pathway to residential areas since the direction of the water traveled northwest. The groundwater is also not a part of public water supply. The report concluded, ""Radiation in the groundwater will not harm people’s health as there is no indication that contamination is migrating off the site.""

Air-related pathways presented a different result. The report found that air presents a potential pathway to residential areas. However, the agency concluded, ""Although elevated, these out-door levels are not expected to cause harm to people as the levels are below the levels associated with increased lung cancer.""

Soil data collected along the haul roads bordering the landfill showed no evidence of contamination along roads leading to the landfill property.

Beginning in January 2017, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, using air monitoring data, conducted weekly reports in the Bridgeton landfill area.

January reports concluded, ""Gamma radiation rates continue to be indistinguishable from natural background levels and were below levels of public health concern."" The same result was found in Julyof this year.

According to Benjamin Washburn, an EPA spokesperson, the agency’s primary concern is radionuclides.

""While there is no current unacceptable off-site health concerns, if individuals in the future were to be exposed to radionuclides, it could result in an increased risk of developing cancer,"" Washburn said.

Washburn went on to say the likelihood of cancer is based on a number of factors, which include the levels of radiation emitted, duration of exposure and distance from the source of radiation. He added that the distance between the landfill and the nearby community of Spanish Village is approximately one-half mile and the distance between Terrisan Reste mobile home park is approximately one-quarter mile from the landfill.

In 2016, a couple in Spanish Village filed a lawsuit, which prompted residents to express their health concerns. In response, EPA personnel and contractors, sampling and screening two residential homes in Spanish Village, concluded ""all of the laboratory results were below EPA’s residential screening levels.""

The EPA, potentially responsible parties and other government agencies have taken a number of steps to combat short-term health concerns and are in the process of developing a long-term remedial plan. A list of actions since 2008 can be found on its website.

""While there is no current unacceptable off-site health concern arising from the radiological waste contained at the West Lake Landfill, the EPA is overseeing the investigations and, ultimately, the implementation of a remedy that will protect human health and the environment over the long-term,"" Washburn said.

Are people dying?

So if the area is safe, like governmental research studies claim it is, why would Chappelle-Nadal make a claim like this?

The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services found in a 1996-2004 cancer study for residents adjacent to the West Lake Landfill ""several types of cancer were found at significantly higher incidence rates than expected, including female breast, colon, prostate and kidney.""

The study also mentions, ""while female breast cancer can be associated with radiation, there is minimal evidence for low to moderate level environmental radiation exposure as a risk factor share."" The study concludes that higher cancer rates are more likely caused by common risk factors, such as smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets and diabetes.

In an aggregate study about cancer rates in Missouri counties from 2003-2013, St. Louis County, which includes Bridgeton, contained the highest rates of cancer. St. Louis County includes Bridgeton.

So while levels of cancer are higher in this area, there is no way to tell if this is directly due to the West Lake Landfill, nor is there any way to prove higher cancer rates have anything to do with the radiation from the landfill.

Following the October meeting, EPA officials said they expect to complete a final remedy proposal in the coming months. The agency has collected reports from potentially responsible parties; the reports contain site investigations describing the extent of radiologically-impacted material. The EPA has also reviewed initial drafts of Remedial Investigation Addendum and Final Feasibility Study reports. These documents and community input are needed to support the final remedy decision. More information on draft documents can be found on the EPA’s website.

Our conclusion

Chappelle-Nadal said, ""Radioactive waste is killing our residents"" in the town of Bridgeton.

West Lake Landfill is an ongoing battle among the EPA, Republic Services, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services and Bridgeton residents.While Republic Services, the owner of the landfill, and governmental studies say the air, soil and groundwater surrounding the West Lake Landfill is safe for the most part, Bridgeton residents say the area and the radiation from the landfill causes everything from asthma to cancer."

""Several of the tweeters whose messages I quoted identified themselves via DM to me as Mizzou protesters,"" he said in a direct message.

But just because those account holders claimed they were from Mizzou doesn’t mean they were. The different posts about the protesters had four Twitter accounts in common: @_kyrahardy, @ilovethisnigga, @NeonElectricity and @RheaBans. We dug into those.

@_kyrahardy tweeted: ""Interesting how the news reports are covering the Paris terrorist but said nothing about the terrorist attack at #Mizzou.""

@NeonElectricity tweeted: ""Racist white people kill me, you want everyone to have sympathy for YOUR tragedy, but you have none for ours. #GetTheF---OutOFHere #Mizzou.""

The name was listed on the account was Melanin Monroe. The Missouri student directory contains no listing with the first name of Melanin. There’s one listing for a student with the first name of Monroe, but he has a different Twitter account.

@RheaBans tweeted: ""We can remember the tragedy in Paris and still remember #Mizzou. We are capable of multitasking. Both situations are equally messed up.""

That account has since been deleted and was not accessible using other methods.

We reached out via direct message to those whose Twitter accounts still existed to ask about their connection to MU, but received no response.

None of the Twitter accounts cited have a track record of tweeting about Mizzou prior to this week. They do not reflect the statements of the public face of the Concerned Student 1950 movement.

At MU, several protesters with clear connections to the campus demonstrations posted about the Paris attacks.

Concerned Student 1950, one of the key groups pushing for change at MU, tweeted: ""#PrayersforParis.""

Graduate student Jonathan Butler, who went on a hunger strike for eight days to remove Wolfe from office, said in a lengthy Facebook status: ""So as the world continues to face tragedies, hatred, racism, sexism, etc., every day let us NEVER forget the power of love and NEVER forget the power of community. Love conquers all. Love never fails. Love always wins. #‎InSolidarityWithMizzou#‎PrayForParis#‎PrayForJapan#‎PrayForTheWorld#‎ConcernedStudent1950.""

Reuben Faloughi, an original member of Concerned Student 1950, tweeted: ""Y'all there is so much fight left... Stay woke. #Pray4Paris #Pray4Mizzou #ConcernedStudent1950.""

The Legion of Black Collegians, the black student government at MU, tweeted: ""It is terrible to live in a world where there is so much hate, even towards people you don't know. #PrayForParis #PrayForWorld.""

Our conclusion

Some bloggers and Internet sites posted stories stating that MU protesters were angry that the Paris terrorist attacks stole the spotlight from the controversy at MU.

It’s true that some people did tweet their dissatisfaction with the change in coverage. However, the tweets and commenters cited by the bloggers show no evidence of a connection to MU or the Concerned Student 1950 movement. Using the hashtag #Mizzou doesn’t mean those people were camping on Carnahan Quadrangle or even present on campus.

Meanwhile, leaders of the Concerned Student 1950 demonstrations and the Legion of Black Collegians have posted statements of sympathy and support for the victims of the Paris attacks, not statements of hate or anger.

While it’s impossible to prove beyond a doubt that those who complained about the redirected coverage have no connection to MU, we could find no evidence allowing us to independently verify that these individuals are, in fact, ""Mizzou protesters."""

The protesters were reported to be upset that the attacks directed the national spotlight away from race relations and recent events at MU.

MU has been at the center of tensions related to race relations for weeks. Demonstrations, a student’s hunger strike and a walkout by the football team all led to the resignations of UM System President Tim Wolfe and MU Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin. The events at MU dominated local news coverage and made national headlines. Then, late Friday, terrorist attacks killed 129 people in Paris.

Breitbart News, the Daily Caller, the Washington Times and other outlets ran stories saying ""Mizzou campus activists"" are angry that so much attention was being paid to the attacks in Paris, not the incidents in Missouri.

On Saturday, MU officials released a statement disputing those reports. A statement posted on the missouri.edu website said the people issuing the tweets weren’t a part of the MU community.

""Social media posts expressing dismay that the tragedy in Paris is diverting media attention from events at the University of Missouri are being made by individuals from outside the Mizzou community in an attempt to create conflict,"" the university said. ""Our hearts go out to the citizens of Paris and all those affected by the tragic events of last night.

None of the Twitter accounts cited have a track record of tweeting about Mizzou prior to this week. They do not reflect the statements of the public face of the Concerned Student 1950 movement.

At MU, several protesters with clear connections to the campus demonstrations posted about the Paris attacks.

Concerned Student 1950, one of the key groups pushing for change at MU, tweeted: ""#PrayersforParis.""

Graduate student Jonathan Butler, who went on a hunger strike for eight days to remove Wolfe from office, said in a lengthy Facebook status: ""So as the world continues to face tragedies, hatred, racism, sexism, etc., every day let us NEVER forget the power of love and NEVER forget the power of community. Love conquers all. Love never fails. Love always wins. #‎InSolidarityWithMizzou#‎PrayForParis#‎PrayForJapan#‎PrayForTheWorld#‎ConcernedStudent1950.""

Reuben Faloughi, an original member of Concerned Student 1950, tweeted: ""Y'all there is so much fight left... Stay woke. #Pray4Paris #Pray4Mizzou #ConcernedStudent1950.""

The Legion of Black Collegians, the black student government at MU, tweeted: It is terrible to live in a world where there is so much hate, even towards people you don't know. #PrayForParis #PrayForWorld — LBC (@MizzouLBC) November 14, 2015 Some bloggers and Internet sites posted stories stating that MU protesters were angry that the Paris terrorist attacks stole the spotlight from the controversy at MU. It’s true that some people did tweet their dissatisfaction with the change in coverage. However, the tweets and commenters cited by the bloggers show no evidence of a connection to MU or the Concerned Student 1950 movement. Using the hashtag #Mizzou doesn’t mean those people were camping on Carnahan Quadrangle or even present on campus. Meanwhile, leaders of the Concerned Student 1950 demonstrations and the Legion of Black Collegians have posted statements of sympathy and support for the victims of the Paris attacks, not statements of hate or anger. While it’s impossible to prove beyond a doubt that those who complained about the redirected coverage have no connection to MU, we could find no evidence allowing us to independently verify that these individuals are, in fact, ""Mizzou protesters."""
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2015/sep/24/truth-o-meter-arrives-missouri/,2015-09-24T00:00:00,The Truth-O-Meter arrives in Missouri,"Political speech has a common and frequent victim: the truth.

For years, politicians, officeholders and partisan campaigners have taken liberties with facts, often to advance their causes. Advances in technology and changes in news consumption and messaging strategies make shading the truth seem more prevalent than ever. Candidates and officials carefully tailor comments and assertions to be retweeted or selected as sound bites. Often their statements are never questioned or challenged.

But the same digital technology that makes political speech easier to spread also has made it easier to investigate. The Internet allows rapid access to databases, deep searching of archives and the World Wide Web itself and easy identification of knowledgeable sources and how to reach them.

Against this backdrop, a new specialty in journalism — the modern fact-check — has emerged. Verification has always been a critical element of journalism, but its value now is greater than ever.

While traditional journalism focuses on descriptive reporting and strives to accurately report what was said, fact-checking journalism focuses on accountability reporting and strives to determine whether what was said is actually true.

The application of accountability journalism to political speech is not only important to democracy, it’s popular with readers — especially when news organizations are willing to not only affirm the truth but also blow the whistle on lies. That’s why the Missourian and the Missouri School of Journalism have partnered with PolitiFact, the premiere organization for fact-checking political speech, to ferret out the facts and determine whether the statements and assertions of Missouri’s officeholders and politicians are, in fact, true.

Seven of our top students are engaged in deep research and in finding the experts most capable of casting light on the veracity of a politician’s claim. While reporters from PolitiFact’s national operation run down claims and statements made by presidential candidates and national political officials, as PolitiFact’s Missouri partner, our reporters will focus on newsworthy claims and assertion made by Missouri politicians and officials. Our work, which will form a PolitiFact/Missouri database (and will also go into PolitiFact’s national database), adheres to the same rigorous standards as our national partner.

Our first PolitiFact/Missouri report, investigating a statement made by Gov. Jay Nixon about how Missouri leads the nation in holding down tuition rates, is available here.

""We’re thrilled that PolitiFact has found a home in Missouri. We hope Missouri voters are too,"" said Aaron Sharockman, an editor and writer with PolitiFact. ""PolitiFact/Missouri will help voters make better informed decisions when they cast their ballot in next year’s elections.""

PolitiFact was launched in 2007 by the Tampa Bay Times to fact check the 2008 presidential campaign. Five reporters and editors probed more than 750 claims made during the campaign, and the Pulitzer Prize board honored the startup’s coverage with a Pulitzer for National Reporting the following April.

It has since launched partnerships with news organizations in eight states. Missouri makes nine.

PolitiFact strives to be honest, fair and transparent in its reporting. It rigorously checks out claims by Democrats, Republicans and politicians of every stripe. It’s not uncommon for the online version of an individual fact-check to list more than a dozen links to relevant sources used in analyzing a claim. This transparent approach to ""showing your work"" allows readers to do their own reporting and assure themselves of the quality of the reporter’s work.

PolitiFact stories focus on verifiable statements, not opinions. In addition, PolitiFact’s approach recognizes that context matters. Reporters always try to obtain the original statement in its full form. Whenever possible, reporters go to original sources. And reporters are dogged in seeking the evidence that will prove or disprove an assertion.

While the reporting is thorough and meticulous, PolitiFact may be best known for the way it categorizes its conclusions about the truth of a statement. The organization introduced the ""Truth-O-Meter,"" a scale that acknowledges that the truth of a political statement is rarely a black-and-white affair.

Truth-O-Meter rulings are determined by a panel of at least three editors and reporters, who review the reporting and decide what level of a ruling will be applied.

There are six levels of PolitiFact’s ratings. Here are the definitions of each:

True — The statement is accurate and nothing significant is missing.

Mostly True — The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Half True — The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Mostly False — The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

False — The statement is not accurate.

Pants on Fire — The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Fact checking political speech can be an essential tool in helping citizens learn the truth and in making informed decisions about what to believe and what to discount.

I have no doubt that some of the politicians we fact-check in the coming months will be uncomfortable with the level of scrutiny to which their words are subjected. That’s too bad.

We pay officeholders to represent us and to make thoughtful decisions in the public interest. Asking them to be honest and truthful when they speak is not an unfair or extraordinary expectation.

We should hold our politicians to the highest standards of telling the truth. If they can’t do that, they should expect to be called on the carpet."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/18/ron-paul/ron-paul-wrong-say-no-basis-coronavirus-death-rate/,2020-03-18T00:00:00,Ron Paul wrong to say no basis for coronavirus death rate,"But early data indicate it is more than 10 times higher than the death rate for the flu.

It’s not yet known what the death rate from the current coronavirus, COVID-19, will be.

For decades, Anthony Fauci has been held up as one of the federal government’s foremost public health experts. Even at age 79, he is one of the top advisers to President Donald Trump on the coronavirus crisis.

Yet Ron Paul, a sometimes conspiracy-minded Texas doctor, former GOP congressman and former presidential candidate, seemed to raise a fair question about a coronavirus statement made by Fauci.

Calling Fauci ""the chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration,"" Paul wrote in a column on his website that Fauci ""testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is 10 times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis.""

We wondered about the scientific basis attack. In some contexts, public health experts have said it’s too early in the coronavirus outbreak to know exactly what it’s death rate is.

Paul’s post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

""I can’t think of a more universally trusted person among virologists than"" Fauci, who has served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, said Emily Bruce, an immunobiology faculty scientist at the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont.

Fauci is taking the seasonal influenza death rate to be approximately 0.1% and the coronavirus to be about 1%, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security.

""While it is early in the outbreak, there is enough data to say that 1% is likely a fairly reasonable approximation with some scientific basis in data.""

While the numbers aren’t all precise, there is a basis for what Fauci said.

As we’ve reported:

Based solely on the numbers, you’re more likely to die if you get the 2019 coronavirus than if you get the flu. (Several factors apply, such as age and health.)

A study of 44,672 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in China diagnosed as of Feb. 11, 2020, from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found a fatality rate of 2.3%. A March 3, 2020, estimate from the World Health Organization put the figure at 3.4%, although that figure is likely inflated given how many cases are mild and not treated in hospitals. Some people who die never report having had coronavirus.

The latest daily report on COVID-19 from the World Health Organization, issued March 16, 2020, said there have been 167,515 confirmed cases and 6,606 deaths. That’s a death rate of 3.9%.

The flu death rate is much lower.

In its latest weekly report on the 2019-20 flu, for the week ending March 7, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there have been 36 million flu illnesses and 22,000 deaths. That’s a rate of 0.0006%.

The case fatality ratio — dividing reported deaths by reported cases — is only a snapshot and the rate can vary considerably during an outbreak, the World Health Organization told us.

""We will not have a clear CFR until the outbreak is over,"" WHO said in a statement, adding that the CFR can change if it is discovered that there are many more milder cases than originally thought, and can vary by country based demographic factors, such as age.

We didn’t hear back from our requests for information from Paul.

Our ruling

Paul said that Anthony Fauci’s statement that the coronavirus death rate is 10 times that of the seasonal flu is ""a claim without any scientific basis.""

We won’t know for some time what the actual death rate is for people who contract the current coronavirus, COVID-19. But based on figures that are available, it’s indicated to be at least 10 times higher than the death rate from the flu. We rate Paul’s statement False."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/18/sean-hannity/hannity-wrong-health-care-system-ready-coronavirus/,2020-03-18T00:00:00,Hannity wrong that health care system is ready as is for coronavirus,"Social distancing and other measures to slow the virus’s spread are meant to shrink the peak number of cases so hospitals don’t get stretched past their capacity.

The U.S. could take any number of actions to increase the number of hospital beds, supplies and medical staff available.

Experts said all evidence points to the U.S. being short on hospital beds, ICUs and ventilators, assuming COVID-19 continues to spread.

Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity celebrated the White House’s response to the novel coronavirus in a recent TV monologue, saying the U.S. health care system is ready for the virus.

""We need to prepare for the worst-case scenario,"" Hannity said on his TV show March 16. ""The president and his task force confirmed they are. Now, as it stands, our health care system has adequate ventilators, ICU beds, medical professionals and ultimately, like I said, we must prepare for the worst, pray for the best.""

That contradicts the warnings of public health experts, who have been sounding alarm about the shortage of ventilators, intensive care unit beds and medical professionals and encouraging Americans to practice social distancing as a way of preventing hospitals from being overrun.

Hannity is wrong to say the U.S. has everything it will need, experts said. U.S. hospitals might be able to deal with the number of patients today — although experts we spoke to disagreed on whether that was the case — but the situation will likely look different as it evolves.

""We don’t have nearly enough hospital and ICU beds if there is a surge of cases,"" said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. ""There is no basis for his assertion.""

""Even a mild surge of COVID patients will stress our ICUs as they have never been stressed before,"" added Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

The available data suggests that U.S. hospitals are not as well-equipped as Hannity claimed.

A surge of cases could overwhelm hospitals

According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people. That ratio puts the U.S. behind other countries — such as China and Italy — that have struggled to keep up with the spread of COVID-19.

That doesn’t bode well for the U.S. response to the coronavirus. As of March 16, Italy has seen more than 24,700 confirmed infections and over 1,800 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Hospitals can’t handle the influx of patients, forcing doctors into difficult decisions.

In a March 12 op-ed in the New York Times, health policy experts wrote that if 5% of the country catches COVID-19, there will be enough serious cases to overwhelm the health care system.

""If we follow the curve that Italy has followed, in two to three weeks we will no longer have adequate supplies of any of those necessary resources,"" Matthew Wynia, director of the Center for Bioethics and Humanities at the University of Colorado, told us.

A March 17 analysis from the Harvard Global Health Institute, ProPublica and the New York Times shows how many beds would be filled in parts of the United States if, over the next six, 12 or 18 months, the coronavirus infects 20%, 40% or 60% of the country.

The projections show that many U.S. cities won’t have enough hospital beds to meet the number of sick patients in need, assuming the virus continues to spread and nothing is done to increase the hospitals’ capacity. Some states will be worse off than others.

In the worst-case scenario — where 60% of the population gets sick within six months — the U.S. would need seven times the number of available hospital beds it currently has, the analysis found. Even in a moderate scenario where 40% is infected over 12 months, many cities such as Washington, D.C., would still need to significantly expand hospital capacity.

Jha, who worked on that project, told us its findings show Hannity’s claim to be wrong.

The health care system is projected to be overwhelmed by coronavirus patients unless drastic measures are taken. Social distancing and isolation will slow its spread. Here is why that will save lives. pic.twitter.com/R1djQQdpYc — ProPublica (@propublica) March 17, 2020

Another analysis from USA Today found that ""there could be almost six seriously ill patients for every existing hospital bed"" — and possibly as many as 17 patients per bed.

That examination said the 6-to-1 ratio was a ""conservative"" estimate based on the assumption that all the hospital beds in the U.S. are currently empty. They’re not.

""Our ICUs are currently stretched thin by flu, and we have shortages of nurses and doctors in many parts of the country,"" Toner told us.

A February report Toner worked on at Johns Hopkins said the U.S. has approximately 46,500 ICU beds in total.

If the coronavirus spreads at a moderate pace, then 1 million Americans could be hospitalized and 200,000 Americans would ultimately need an ICU, the report said. A more severe scenario could put up to 9.6 million Americans in the hospital and 2.9 million in need of ICUs.

A separate Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security report identified about 160,000 ventilators in the country, though not all are full-featured. That includes tens of thousands of ventilators in hospitals nationwide and thousands more in an emergency federal stockpile.

But in 2018, the group estimated that a moderate pandemic similar to the 1957 or 1968 influenza viruses would put about 65,000 people in need of ventilation, and a severe pandemic like the 1918 flu would require ventilators for some 742,500 people.

Not all COVID-19 patients will need treatment at the same time, of course. Aaron Carroll, professor at the Indiana School of Medicine, wrote in the New York Times that a key metric is ""the difference between the total number of people who might get sick and the number who might get sick at the same time."" But states and doctors are worried about shortages.

Social distancing, shutdowns and other preventative measures to slow the spread are meant to shrink the peak number of cases so hospitals don’t get stretched past their capacity.

Together, we can “flatten the curve” by practicing social distancing, staying home when sick, and washing hands often. This will reduce the strain on our hospitals and emergency rooms, and literally save the lives of our most vulnerable residents. #COVIDー19 #NovelCoronavirus pic.twitter.com/6Yzvg3DONv — LA Public Health (@lapublichealth) March 15, 2020

""That is why hospitals are cancelling all elective surgeries, planning to expand capacity as much as possible, and even getting ready to make very difficult, battlefield-style triage decisions if it comes to that,"" Wynia said. ""There is an enormous storm coming, and our best meteorologists can’t be sure exactly how big it will be, when it makes landfall, or where it might hit hardest.""

The message from the White House

President Donald Trump has said the federal government has ordered more equipment and instructed governors to purchase supplies directly if they can get them faster on their own.

""We’ve ordered massive numbers of ventilators,"" Trump said during a March 17 briefing. ""By any normal standards, we have a lot of respirators, ventilators.""

Trump said the Army Corps of Engineers is ""ready, willing and able"" to retrofit its facilities and build new field hospitals to care for more patients, saying they could do so ""very rapidly.""

In the same briefing, Vice President Mike Pence called on construction companies to donate their masks to local hospitals, and Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the coronavirus task force, said Americans should cancel elective surgeries to ""free up hospital beds and space.""

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said March 18 that Trump has pledged to dispatch a Navy hospital ship to New York Harbor to accommodate patients there.

Our ruling

Hannity said, ""Now, as it stands, our health care system has adequate ventilators, ICU beds, medical professionals.""

That might be true if the U.S. stopped the coronavirus from spreading any further. But given the country’s likely trajectory, experts said all evidence points to the U.S. being short on beds, ICUs, ventilators and medical professionals.

The U.S. will need to take steps to slow the spread and expand hospital capacity if it wants to keep its health care system from being overrun by the likely uptick in cases.

Here’s what actually happened on Wallace’s March 6 show. Eddie Glaude Jr., an African American studies professor at Princeton University, said that Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak in the United States could be comparable to former President George W. Bush’s response to Hurricane Katrina.

""I was thinking in terms of politics,"" Glaude said. ""We talked about the business community finally not kind of sticking with Donald Trump. But this may be, and Nicolle, I should mention this with trepidation, but this may be Donald Trump’s Katrina.""

""Let’s just lean into that for a minute,"" replied Wallace, who served as Bush’s communications director. ""Katrina was the moment when all the things that felt incredibly incompetent about the Bush presidency, the appointment of Harriet Myers to the Supreme Court, the botched attempt to pass Social Security privatization — I mean I lived it, I can go through the whole list — were realized. We gave them a proof point that we were indeed incompetent. Also people died. This has the makings structurally for the same kind of moment for President Trump.""

""And if there’s any ‘a moment’ that would shake that 40%,"" Glaude said, ""the folks who would allow him to shoot someone right down Fifth Avenue, if there’s any ‘a moment,’ it’s this one. Because it’s babies, it’s friends, it’s loved ones … it seems to me that this is an event that could take down a presidency.""

A spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Department of Health said it was the first incident where that many people met the criteria for testing in such a short timespan.

After Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the state of Oklahoma administered tests to 58 people in a matter of hours.

The novel coronavirus reached the NBA this week, with Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert testing positive in Oklahoma City moments before the Jazz were set to tip off against the Thunder.

The development led the NBA to suspend its season. The Jazz said in a statement that after diagnostic tests were administered to team players, staff and traveling beat reporters, only one of the reported 58 people tested in connection with Gobert — guard Donovan Mitchell, who confirmed his positive test on Instagram — was found to be carrying COVID-19.

The Jazz’s quick access to 58 coronavirus tests seemed at odds with the fact that the United States has lagged behind other countries where testing has been more widespread.

""Some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the Utah Jazz got 58?"" said Michael Dougherty, a senior writer for the National Review, in a March 12 tweet.

Some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the Utah Jazz got 58?



If tests are going to remain scarce, how they're distributed will be a subject not just of controversy, but of fury and reprisal. https://t.co/Eip3nNOOXR — Michael Brendan Dougherty (@michaelbd) March 12, 2020

We wondered how the Jazz team personnel got their hands on COVID-19 tests in a matter of hours, and what kind of access states have had to testing by comparison.

We found that Dougherty’s claim lined up with the information that’s available, despite some murkiness around the number of tests that have been conducted across the country.

How the Jazz got tests so quickly

After a sprinting medical staffer alerted referees to Gobert’s confirmed infection minutes before the game was supposed to start, the state of Oklahoma quickly completed tests for 58 people close to the organization who had come in contact with Gobert.

The results for those 58 people came back within nine to 10 hours, said Andy Larsen, a Jazz beat writer for the Salt Lake Tribune who was tested for having been in recent contact with Gobert.

The process was fast, with medical professionals taking throat and sinus swabs from the team personnel at the arena, Larsen said. ""It really only does take like two minutes,"" he said.

The specimens were then shipped to Oklahoma’s public health lab, where they were tested overnight using test kits provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Jaime Dukes, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Department of Health.

Dukes told us the Oklahoma lab has been running tests since March 6, and that the lab has completed roughly 150 tests since then, including the tests on the Jazz personnel.

That means many of the tests in Oklahoma were completed in one night. Dukes said that’s because Oklahoma has been following the CDC’s case-definition requirements, which currently say that clinicians should use judgment to decide if a symptomatic patient should be tested.

Clinicians are supposed to prioritize people with serious symptoms, people who are older or have underlying medical conditions, and people who had close contact with a confirmed or suspected coronavirus patient or recently traveled to an affected area, according to the CDC.

""That honestly was the first incident we’ve had where 58 people at one time needed to be tested,"" Dukes said. ""We’ve been meeting the demand, but we are being very clear about our criteria for testing.""

NBA spokesman Tim Frank said Oklahoma health officials directed the Jazz testing without intervention from the NBA, and that there was ""nothing we did to accelerate it.""

But state epidemiologist Laurence Burnsed, speaking at a March 12 press conference, said the NBA has ""policies in place"" that helped Gobert get tested quickly. NBA team trainers regularly monitor players for illness and work with local physicians when needed, Burnsed said.

According to the Associated Press, a number of other NBA franchises are having employees self-quarantine or get tested after coming into contact with Gobert and Mitchell in recent weeks.

How many tests are being conducted per state?

It’s hard to precisely say how many tests the U.S. has administered, in part because the CDC has outsourced some responsibility to states as well as private, academic and commercial labs. There’s no centralized database tracking everything.

Testing in the U.S. was slowed from the get-go by flaws with the government’s early test kits and barriers that have been relaxed but still limit who can get tested.

Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said March 7 that public health labs have the ability to test a total of 75,000 people.

He also said 1.1 million tests had been shipped to private labs, with another roughly 1 million on the way and still more to come from other academic and commercial labs.

The U.S. took another step toward increasing its capabilities on March 13 when it gave over $1 million to two companies to develop new, one-hour tests.

It’s not clear that those capabilities are being met, however.

According to a tracker from the American Enterprise Institute, the different labs running tests throughout the U.S. should have been capable of cumulatively testing more than 25,000 per day, at least as of March 13. (Dougherty is also a visiting fellow at AEI.)

Plus, the number of tests isn’t the same as the number of people who have been tested. Not everyone seeking a coronavirus test can get one. Even sick people have been denied.

As of March 12, the CDC’s website said it had tested roughly 3,903 specimens in CDC labs, plus about 9,721 in public health labs across the U.S.’s various states.

Those numbers, while incomplete, pale in comparison with countries like South Korea, which ramped up testing weeks ago by setting up drive-thru screening clinics.

""Widespread testing was a key component of China and South Korea's response strategy,"" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""Both countries have made significant progress in controlling their outbreaks.""

The U.S. pace has been more sluggish. Dougherty told us his claim could be traced to early March reports from the Atlantic and Buzzfeed News, which said public health labs in states such as Hawaii and Arkansas were capable at the time of running fewer than 50 tests per day.

Dougherty also cited a recent report from Yahoo News, which relied on state and federal data from the COVID Tracking Project, a project of the Atlantic run by reporters and data scientists.

The project tracks the numbers presented on state government websites to provide a more accurate overall testing count. (While the CDC website highlights the number of specimens tested, the COVID Tracking Project tracks the number of people.)

The Yahoo News article noted that the COVID Tracking Project counted 2,728 people tested by states and the District of Columbia on March 10, for an average of less than 55 per state. Some states tested fewer than 50 that day, according to the project’s tally. The project reported that 2,219 people were tested by states on March 11, or roughly 43 people per state.

Our daily 4pm ET update is out. The topline number is not good: ~10000 people tested, according to our state-level data, which cannot track all negative tests. That's a smaller day-over-day increase than yesterday.

Our ruling

Dougherty said ""some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the Utah Jazz got 58.""

Oklahoma public health officials quickly completed tests on 58 people who had had recent contact with Gobert, the Jazz’s center, after he tested positive for COVID-19.

It’s not clear how many tests each state is running per day. But Dougherty’s claim that ""some states are only getting 50 tests per day"" lines up with what had been reported at the time the claim was made.

The State Department is advising all citizens to reconsider travel abroad. China and Iran have been issued Level 4 travel advisories because of the virus.

Older Americans and those with chronic conditions are advised to reconsider all travel plans to avoid COVID-19.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, airline stocks have plummeted. Companies like Delta, American and United have cut or reduced flights. Photos show empty airport terminals around the world.

On March 13, Fox & Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt took those signs to mean that now is a great time to take a trip.

""It’s actually the safest time to fly,"" she said during the Fox News morning show. ""Everyone I know that’s flying right now, terminals are pretty much dead — ghost towns.""

As of March 12, more than 125,000 people have been infected with COVID-19 in 117 countries, with 4,613 deaths. In the United States, there have been 1,629 confirmed cases in 46 states, with 41 deaths.

In a March 11 address, President Donald Trump announced a sweeping ban on travel from 26 European countries. While the White House maintains the move will slow the spread of the coronavirus, some experts doubt the restrictions will have much of an effect.

PolitiFact wanted to know whether Earhardt was correct to say that now is the safest time to fly.

We reached out to Earhardt for evidence, but we haven’t heard back. Official guidance on COVID-19 contradicts what she said on Fox News.

Officials warn at-risk groups against traveling

Officials are advising older Americans and those with chronic health conditions to reconsider their domestic and international travel plans to avoid COVID-19.

On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there are ""several things you should consider when deciding whether it is safe for you to travel"" in the U.S., including:

Is COVID-19 spreading where you’re going?

Will you or someone you’re traveling with be in close contact with others during your trip?

Are you or someone you’re traveling with at risk of severe illness if you get COVID-19?

Do you live with someone who is older or has a severe chronic health condition?

Is COVID-19 spreading where you live?

If the answer to any of those questions is yes, then you may want to reconsider your travel plans to avoid potentially spreading or contracting the virus.

""CDC’s recommendations differ depending on the location,"" said agency spokeswoman Leslie Dorigo in an email. ""CDC recommends that older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions should consider postponing nonessential travel because they are at increased risk for severe disease.""

That’s because older and immunocompromised people, as well as those with chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, are more at risk of suffering complications from COVID-19. Younger people, even though they may not be as susceptible to the coronavirus, can still serve as carriers for the virus, potentially infecting new communities through travel.

The World Health Organization has similar guidance for international travelers, although it advises against travel bans like the one implemented by the Trump administration.

""It is prudent for travellers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas, in particular for elderly travellers and people with chronic diseases or underlying health conditions,"" read its recommendations. ""General recommendations for personal hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping a distance of at least one metre from persons showing symptoms remain particularly important for all travellers.""

US and other countries issue travel warnings

The U.S. State Department is advising all citizens to reconsider travel abroad due to the spread of COVID-19. Other countries have issued similar travel warnings.

Since January, the State Department has issued several travel advisories related to the COVID-19 outbreak. As of March 13, China and Iran had ""Level 4: Do Not Travel"" advisories — the highest issued by the State Department — while countries like Azerbaijan, Italy and South Korea were labeled as ""Level 3: Reconsider Travel.""

On March 11, the State Department also issued a global health advisory asking Americans to reconsider traveling abroad.

Source: WHO

""Many areas throughout the world are now experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks and taking action that may limit traveler mobility, including quarantines and border restrictions,"" reads the Level 3 advisory. ""Even countries, jurisdictions, or areas where cases have not been reported may restrict travel without notice.""

Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, have issued similar travel advisories.

""It may not be safe to fly, especially if you’re going to one of the COVID-19 hotspots,"" said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, in an email. ""Generally speaking, it is just unwise to be traveling in any form right now.""

How safe are airplanes?

If you do have to travel via airplane, you’re unlikely to get sick while on board, officials say — as long as you practice good hygiene.

The WHO says there is little risk of disease transmission during a flight, mostly due to the way cabin air is filtered. During the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another human coronavirus, in 2003, the risk of disease transmission on airplanes was found to be very low.

Plus, airlines are taking extra steps to clean airplanes and slow the spread of COVID-19.

""Airlines are being more cautious about passengers, they’re doing extra cleaning and disinfecting and they are restricting flights,"" Watanabe said. ""So one might consider flying to be safer than ever.""

Still, it is possible to catch something from an infected person seated in the same area as you.

RELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself

According to the CDC, COVID-19 spreads in two primary ways: close person-to-person contact (within about six feet) and respiratory droplets in coughs and sneezes. If someone with the virus sneezes, those germs could land on surfaces around them, such as airplane seats and armrests. Then, an uninfected person who touches that same surface and then touches their nose, eyes or mouth could contract the virus.

If you do need to travel by plane, public health officials advise practicing good personal hygiene. The ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus include washing your hands with soap and water, covering coughs and sneezes, disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, and avoiding people who are sick.

""We are trying to understand the ‘rules’ that govern transmission of COVID-19 and relative risk from people at different stages of disease, and/or contaminated surfaces and more,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, in an email. ""It seems unwise for commentators to offer travel advice until we who are more expert know far more.""

Our ruling

Earhardt said that ""it's actually the safest time to fly.""

Officials from the CDC and WHO are advising older people and those with chronic health conditions to reconsider travel in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The State Department has issued travel advisories for several individual countries, as well as a global health advisory, related to the disease outbreak. Other countries have taken similar steps. While the disease transmission on airplanes is thought to be a low risk, it is still possible to contract the coronavirus through close personal contact and respiratory droplets.

The spending bills that lawmakers ultimately passed provided more money for those CDC programs than Trump’s budget requests asked for.

News reports in early 2018 said the CDC was preparing to scale back its anti-pandemic programs in some countries because an early source of funding was running out and the agency didn’t expect to receive new money from the Trump administration.

Joy Behar, a co-host of ABC’s ""The View,"" accused President Donald Trump of dismantling anti-pandemic programs the Obama administration set up across the globe.

Barack Obama ""set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries as a way to protect against something like the coronavirus, exactly,"" Behar said during the March 9 episode of the show. ""Do you know that Trump closed 37 of them?""

The TV host’s claim is wrong, and it’s not entirely clear how she got her numbers, either.

Trump did fail to replace top national-security officials in charge of coordinating the U.S. response to pandemics, and he unsuccessfully sought to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But he never slashed the programs Behar was referring to, however.

As the Washington Post noted, there were concerns among global-health leaders that U.S. funding for an initiative known as the Global Health Security Agenda was running out, and that some U.S.-run pandemic-prevention programs would have to be downsized as a result.

But the Trump administration never pulled the plug on those programs, although it did propose smaller budgets. Congress has injected more money into them in recent budget requests.

One day after we reached out to ABC for comment, Behar made a tongue-in-cheek correction on air.

""The other day, I mistakenly said that Trump shut down anti-pandemic programs that Obama had set up in nearly 40 countries,"" Behar said. ""I’m happy to say, he only attempted to cut funding for them, but that did not ultimately go into effect. Isn’t that good?""

Why the CDC thought its programs had to shrink

The CDC has been operating public-health programs in a number of foreign countries as part the Global Health Security Agenda, which the United States helped launch in 2014.

The initiative — which now includes 67 countries — is a global effort to help countries reduce the risk of infectious diseases.

The bulk of its early funding came from a one-time, five-year emergency spending bill that Congress approved in late 2014 to respond to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. The package appropriated almost $600 million for the CDC ""to support national public health institutes and global health security.""

The CDC had hoped those funds would be replenished once the five-year supplement expired in October 2019, according to reports. But as the expiration date approached, it looked like the agency could be left with just the core annual budget to pull from.

National news outlets reported in the spring of 2018 that the CDC was bracing for a possible funding drop-off. The CDC planned to scale back operations in 39 of 49 countries and focus on 10 ""priority countries,"" according to emails reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.

In the end, however, Congress provided enough funding to sustain the programs, experts told us. (The White House and CDC did not respond to our requests for comment. The CDC told Factcheck.org it ""did not have to cut back its work"" to 10 countries.)

""The president's budget proposed slashing funding for CDC's (global health security) initiatives,"" added Claire Standley, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security. ""In the end, that didn't happen.""

The worry in early 2018 was that the budget for the CDC’s global disease-prevention programs would be just over $50 million, as it had been in past years, when the supplement from 2014 was still the primary funding source. Trump’s 2018 budget proposal put it in that ballpark.

But the budget Congress ultimately passed bumped the appropriations for ""global disease detection and other programs"" up to $108.2 million. The same amount was provided in 2019.

In November 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services pledged an additional $150 million ""to support capacity strengthening in high-risk countries around the world"" at a meeting in which the U.S. affirmed its commitment to the next phase of the Global Health Security Agenda.

The Trump administration’s 2021 budget request appropriated $225 million for the same global-health programs, up from $183.2 million in 2020.

As we’ve reported, Trump has consistently proposed cuts to certain CDC budgets, but the bills Congress ultimately passed — with Trump’s signature — have steadily increased funding for the CDC’s infectious-disease activities.

Experts said the administration’s wavering support has likely made it difficult for the CDC to plan out its activities.

""I don't think the 37 out of 47 statement is accurate,"" Standley said. ""But I do think that the Trump administration, in failing to provide consistent funding and clear indication of the priority placed on global health security capacity building, has made it difficult for the CDC to sustain the programs and successful efforts put into place since 2014.""

""Programs weren’t shut down in the end, but you can also say that the administration didn’t prioritize them in the proposed budget,"" added Jennifer Nuzzi, an associate professor of public health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

A problem with the numbers

It’s not clear why Behar referred to a shutdown of 37 of 47 programs when the 2018 news reports said the CDC was considering scaling back 39 of 49 operations.

It’s possible she pulled from a tweet by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., whose claim that Trump ""shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs"" was debunked by other fact-checkers. But however you crunch the numbers, it’s hard to get to 47 countries — or 49, for that matter.

Trump has put no one in charge of Coronavirus.



He is pushing cuts to the budgets of all the agencies that fight pandemics.



He shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs.



Trump made a choice to make us vulnerable...to this pandemic and the next one and the next one. — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) February 25, 2020

A 2019 annual report on the Global Health Security Agenda says the CDC provides financial support and technical assistance to 17 priority countries, plus technical assistance for 14 countries and CARICOM, a group of 15 Caribbean countries and dependencies.

One CARICOM country is Haiti, which is already listed among the countries receiving technical assistance from the CDC. Another is Montserrat, a British territory.

That adds up to 44 total countries, or 50 if you include six other countries that Standley said received some early support specifically related to the Ebola outbreak.

Our ruling

Behar said Obama ""set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries as a way to protect against something like the coronavirus"" and ""Trump closed 37 of them.""

News reports in 2018 said the CDC was planning to shrink its operations to help foreign countries prevent infectious diseases because it didn’t expect to receive new funding once the supplement it received in 2014 ran out. But the programs didn’t shut down in the end.

The spending bill that lawmakers ultimately passed that year provided more money for those CDC programs than Trump’s budget request originally asked for.

It’s complicated,"Researchers are still learning more about the severity of the coronavirus. That uncertainty makes it hard to make risk comparisons to other viruses.

But, as of now, the flu is more common in the United States than the coronavirus. Both diseases spread similarly and affect similar at-risk groups.

Based solely on the numbers, you’re more likely to die if you get the 2019 coronavirus than if you get the flu.

The 2019 coronavirus has infected more than 113,000 people in 109 countries. But Dr. Drew Pinsky wants the press to focus more on the flu.

In a Feb. 3 segment on Daily Blast Live, a live daytime news and entertainment program, Pinsky, an internist and television personality, lambasted press coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. At the time, more than 17,000 people had been infected, almost all in China.

""The press is overreacting, and it makes me furious,"" he said. ""The press needs to shut up. Because you’re more likely to die of influenza right now.""

Over the following month, the virus spread to 84 other countries, killing thousands of people in the process. But in a follow-up segment March 5, Pinsky doubled down on his comments.

""As I’ve been saying for the last month, what we should be talking about is flu generally,"" he said. ""There’s 16,000 dead, 280,000 hospitalized in this country from influenza. The message should be: Get your flu shot.""

The Feb. 3 video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been repurposed into a meme.

Since its outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December, we have fact-checked a slew of social media posts and statements that aim to minimize the threat of the 2019 coronavirus. Some of them falsely claim there is a media-run conspiracy to exaggerate the threat of the virus.

Is Dr. Drew, whose own show was canceled in 2016 after he speculated about Hillary Clinton’s health, right to say that the flu poses a bigger threat than the coronavirus? Yes and no.

Coronavirus has a higher mortality rate

Based solely on the numbers, you’re more likely to die if you get the 2019 coronavirus than if you get the flu. (Several factors apply, such as age and health.)

As of March 10, 4,012 people around the world had died after being infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The death toll in the United States is 28.

A study of 44,672 confirmed cases of the virus from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 80% of the cases were mild, but the virus had a fatality rate of 2.3%. A more recent estimate from the World Health Organization puts the number at 3.4%, although that figure is likely inflated given how many cases are mild and not treated in hospitals.

For comparison, the fatality rate of this year’s strain of the flu is estimated to be between 0.05% and 0.1% in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between 20,000 and 52,000 have died.

RELATED: Why it’s hard to estimate the coronavirus death rate this early

The higher death count for the flu is a result of its prevalence. As of now, the flu is more common in the United States than the coronavirus. So even though it has a lower mortality rate, it kills more people.

""The prevalence of flu is higher at this moment in time,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. ""(But) pound for pound, if you had both viruses, the one that’s more likely to make you die is the coronavirus.""

We reached out to Dr. Drew for comment, but we haven’t heard back.

Flu poses a bigger risk — for now

Experts cautioned against minimizing the potential harm of COVID-19.

As of March 10, there were 647 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States. Meanwhile, the CDC estimates that there were between 34 million and 49 million flu illnesses this season.

""For most people, the immediate risk of being exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be low,"" the CDC says in its risk assessment. ""This virus is not currently widespread in the United States.""

According to the Chinese CDC study, those most likely to die from the coronavirus were older than 60 and/or had preexisting medical conditions, like hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Men were also more likely than women to die.

Those risk factors are pretty similar to those for the flu. Both diseases also spread similarly: through respiratory droplets in coughs and sneezes.

RELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself

Researchers are still looking into how contagious the 2019 coronavirus is compared with other viruses, at what points it can be transmitted to other people and how common it really is in American communities. That uncertainty makes it hard to draw comparisons between the potential threat of COVID-19 and the current threat of the flu.

""We know a great deal more about transmission of influenza; we know a great deal about who is most likely to become gravely ill; we have drug treatment; we have a vaccine, even if imperfect,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health & Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, in an email. ""I think you can see big differences.""

The ways to prevent the spread of both the 2019 coronavirus and the flu are similar: wash your hands, avoid touching your face, disinfect your home and stay away from people who are sick.

""While it may be true that ‘you're more likely to die of influenza right now,’ that is really the wrong way to look at the question,"" said Emily Bruce, a faculty scientist at the University of Vermont’s Division of Immunobiology, in an email. ""It's more important to ask, ‘What will the situation look like three months from now if we do nothing?’""

Part of the current public health response is trying to prevent COVID-19 from becoming an established, regularly occurring illness like the flu.

Our ruling

Dr. Drew said ""you’re more likely to die of influenza right now"" than the 2019 coronavirus.

The key phrase in this claim is ""right now."" It’s true that, as of March 10, the flu poses a more immediate threat to the American public than the 2019 coronavirus. That’s because it’s currently more widespread; the CDC estimated there were as many as 49 million flu illnesses from October to February, while there have been 647 coronavirus cases in the United States.

But the mortality rate of the flu is lower than that of COVID-19 — the former is estimated to be as high as 0.1%, while the latter is around 3.4% so far. That means you’re more likely to die if you get the coronavirus than if you get the flu, even though you’re less likely to contract COVID-19.

Dr. Drew’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True."

This is bad math. $500 million divided by 327 million people would be roughly $1.53 per person, not $1 million.

MSNBC anchor Brian Williams aired a tweet during his TV show that said former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who self-funded his since-suspended presidential campaign, spent so much money on ads that he could have instead delivered every American a fortune.

""Bloomberg spent $500 million on ads,"" the tweet said. ""The U.S. population is 327 million. He could have given each American $1 million and still have money left over. I feel like a $1 million check would be life-changing for most people. Yet he wasted it all on ads and STILL LOST.""

Williams read from the tweet after it was introduced by Mara Gay, a member of the New York Times editorial board, who said that ""somebody tweeted recently that actually, with the money (Bloomberg) spent, he could’ve given every American a million dollars.""

how did this end up on tv? pic.twitter.com/xUYIOChhKv — andrew kaczynski🤔 (@KFILE) March 6, 2020

""It’s an incredible way of putting it,"" Williams said after displaying the tweet on screen.

If that sounds too good to be true, it’s because it is. A quick use of a calculator shows that $500 million divided by 327 million people is actually about $1.53 per person.

That’s enough to buy a pack of gum or a Kit Kat bar at CVS, but it’s not breaking the bank.

Williams quickly corrected the error on air, and the Twitter account for his TV show issued a correction and apology in a tweet posted hours after the show finished.

""Turns out Mara and I got the same grades at math,"" Williams said after a commercial break. ""I’m speaking of the tweet we both misinterpreted. He could give each American a dollar.""

""The tweet is wrong,"" he said.

Gay also tweeted about the incident, saying she was ""buying a calculator, brb.""

As for the author of the original tweet, she switched her Twitter account settings to private but wrote in her bio, ""I know, I’m bad at math.""

Bloomberg did spend in the ballpark of $500 million on ads and other campaign-related finances, according to reports. And the census estimates that the U.S. population is a little more than 327 million people.

But even at roughly $500 million, the billionaire didn’t spend nearly the amount of money he would've needed to give every American $1 million. That’s bad math.

So far, the United States has lagged behind other nations in terms of coronavirus testing. It has recently taken steps to ramp up its testing capabilities.

Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and his allies, challenged the president’s top health official recently on the administration’s handling of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak.

Dobbs criticized Health and Human Secretary Alex Azar over a lack of transparency in the agency’s handling of COVID-19, which has infected nearly 91,000 people globally across 73 countries and led to more than nine American deaths.

""There’s a better ratio of testing for the coronavirus in other countries than we maintain here,"" Dobbs said during the March 2 interview on his TV show. ""We’re actually screening fewer people because we don’t have appropriate testing.""

Azar countered that the Trump administration has taken recent steps to roll back regulations and increase the availability of diagnostic test kits to ""hundreds and thousands and millions.""

The United States is set to significantly expand its testing capabilities in the coming days and weeks, but Dobbs is correct that the country has lagged behind other nations so far.

""It is true that diagnostic capacity in the U.S. has been lower than in some other countries, but that is changing,"" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

The trouble with testing numbers

It’s hard to pinpoint how many people have been tested for the coronavirus, both in the U.S. and around the world. The World Health Organization doesn’t track the number of tests administered in each country, and the numbers that are available are constantly updating.

In a statement to PolitiFact, a Fox News spokesperson representing Dobbs cited data from the WorldOMeter, a real-time tool that ""shows estimated current numbers based on statistics and projections from the most reputable official organizations,"" according to its website.

Using estimates derived from official government sources, the WorldOMeter says at least eight countries — South Korea, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Finland, Vietnam and Turkey — have given more tests relative to the size of their populations than the United States.

That lines up with experts’ analyses and with what multiple news outlets have reported.

Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said South Korea ""has screened at least thousands, and Guangdong, China, has screened at least hundreds of thousands,"" citing a WHO report on the outbreak in China, where the virus was first detected.

South Korea ramped up testing by building drive-thru screening clinics for speedy assessments, according to local reports. Other countries, like Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Italy have also conducted thousands of diagnostic tests.

""We have done nothing like what other countries have done,"" Lipsitch said, noting that the U.S. had, until recently, limited not only the number of labs that were allowed to conduct tests on suspected cases, but also the number of patients that were eligible to be screened.

It’s difficult to say just how far behind the U.S. has fallen, due to the murkiness around the number of administered tests. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped releasing a public count of tests on March 2.

The administration’s public statements haven’t cleared it up. On Feb. 29, the CDC reported testing 472 Americans. A day later, Azar told ABC News the U.S. had tested over 3,600 people. And a spokesperson for HHS, Azar’s agency, told us on March 3 that the CDC had tested samples from more than 1,200 patients.

""I don't know how to track U.S. tests any more,"" Lipsitch said.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar speaks at the White House about the coronavirus on Feb. 28, 2020, in Washington. (AP/Vucci)

The CDC stopped posting testing data as more state and local public-health labs have been brought into the fold, said Nancy Messonnier, a top CDC official, said during a March 3 briefing.

""With more and more testing done at states, these numbers would not be representative of the testing being done nationally,"" she said.

An HHS spokesperson told us that the department doesn’t know how many additional tests have been administered by those state and local labs, adding that those labs can now test up to 15,000 people and are expected to be able to test as many as 75,000 people by March 6.

The U.S. test count should rise into the millions as IDT, a commercial manufacturer, and other commercial and academic labs begin producing their own tests soon, according to HHS.

Why the United States lagged behind

The government’s initial testing effort was hindered by flaws with the CDC’s early test kits and restrictions that had limited which labs could run the tests and which patients could be tested.

When the first U.S. coronavirus was detected, the country brushed aside the WHO test used by other nations and leaned on the CDC to develop and mass produce a more complicated test capable of detecting other viruses in addition to the coronavirus, according to reports.

The test kits went out in early February. But some state labs that received them reported that flaws in the tests were triggering inconclusive results. Those states had to ship samples out to the CDC’s offices in Atlanta for results until the CDC fixed the problem weeks later.

Since then, the Food and Drug Administration has given labs and hospitals across the country the go-ahead to administer their own tests before the FDA finishes reviewing them, so long as those tests are proven to work. That should lead to more testing, experts said.

The CDC also modified its screening criteria to expand testing for some people with severe respiratory symptoms who did not travel to China or come into known contact with a coronavirus patient. Previously, travel to China or exposure to the virus were preconditions for screening.

Adequate testing is essential to getting an accurate count of U.S. cases, experts said.

Testing is also key for treating patients and identifying people who might be infected but don’t show symptoms, said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California.

""The latest data suggests the incubation period for COVID-19 can be as long as a couple of weeks,"" Watanabe said.

Despite the recent acceleration, Lipsitch said U.S. testing is happening ""very slowly and at a level that is still paltry"" compared with some other countries.

Our ruling

Dobbs said that the United States is ""actually screening fewer people (for the coronavirus than other countries) because we don’t have appropriate testing.""

Experts told us that to date, the United States has lagged behind other countries, though numbers are imprecise. An error with the CDC’s early test kits contributed to the United States’ relatively low screening numbers. The administration has taken steps to make testing more widely available.

With that additional information, we rate Dobbs’ statement Mostly True."

The 2019 coronavirus is a new virus that had not been previously identified.

The 2019 coronavirus is part of a family of viruses that produce illnesses ranging from the common cold to more critical diseases such as SARS or MERS.

Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh accused the media of overhyping the 2019 coronavirus that’s infected nearly 80,000 people worldwide, calling it ""the common cold"" and claiming, without evidence, that it’s ""being weaponized"" as an attack on President Donald Trump.

""It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump,"" Limbaugh said Feb. 24 on his radio show. ""Now, I want to tell you the truth about the coronavirus … I’m dead right on this. The coronavirus is the common cold, folks.""

""The drive-by media hype up this thing as a pandemic,"" Limbaugh continued. ""Ninety-eight percent of people who get the coronavirus survive. It’s a respiratory system virus.""

The recent Presidential Medal of Freedom winner went on to push the debunked conspiracy theory that the new coronavirus strain was created in a lab as a bioweapon. But we were also struck by his claim that the 2019 coronavirus is nothing more than ""the common cold.""

We didn’t have to look far to see where Limbaugh went wrong. In a FAQ about the 2019 coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addressed his confusion head-on.

""A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified,"" the CDC wrote. ""The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not that same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.""

The 2019 coronavirus is a novel strain of coronavirus

The current strain of coronavirus was first detected in December in Wuhan, China. It’s one of seven types of coronaviruses that can infect humans, according to the CDC.

Named for the crown-like spikes on their surface, coronaviruses are typically found in animals such as camels, cattle and bats. Strains infecting humans were discovered in the mid 1960s.

Most strains that affect humans are relatively mild and take the form of respiratory diseases such as the common cold. But more serious strains have emerged over the last two decades, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which spread across the globe in 2003.

According to the CDC, the 2019 coronavirus is a ""beta coronavirus"" similar to SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which was first identified in 2012.

All three viruses have their origins in bats, and all three can induce symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath — similar to some common colds. More severe cases can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and death, according to the World Health Organization.

A CDC fact-sheet describing common human coronaviruses said most people contract some type of coronavirus during their lives and that the more common strains ""usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold.""

But the same fact-sheet also knocked down the idea that the 2019 coronavirus was the exact same as the more common strains. ""This information applies to common human coronaviruses and should not be confused with Coronavirus Disease-2019,"" it said.

What Limbaugh got wrong

Limbaugh seems to have been ""mixing up clinical symptoms as defining the disease,"" said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California.

""Many diseases start off with ‘flu-like symptoms’ and progress on to something else,"" Watanabe said, noting that the 2019 coronavirus is part of a different family of viruses than the flu.

RELATED: A reader’s guide to misinformation about the coronavirus

Neurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta said on air that Limbaugh’s comparison was ""minimizing"" what the 2019 coronavirus could become.

""This is a brand new virus,"" he said. ""I think what Rush Limbaugh is referring to is the idea that it is from a family of coronaviruses. That is the family name of these viruses, and some of them in the past have caused systems that were more consistent with the common cold. But it’s also been the same family of viruses that caused SARS, that caused MERS.""

Experts from the National Institutes of Health and Penn State University’s College of Medicine drew a line from the spread of the 2019 virus to outbreaks of SARS and MERS in a report titled ""Coronavirus Infections — More Than Just the Common Cold.""

According to the WHO, about 80% of 2019 coronavirus patients have recovered from mild symptoms without needing special treatment, while roughly 1 in every 6 people have become ""seriously ill."" About 2% of people have died. (For comparison, the flu — which is more severe than the common cold — has an estimated death rate in the United States of about 0.1%).

People who are older or have certain pre-existing health conditions have been more likely to experience serious symptoms, the WHO’s website says.

""There are alpha coronaviruses that cause common cold,"" said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. ""This is a beta coronavirus like SARS and MERS and is approximately 20 to 30 times more deadly than (the) flu.""

As of Feb. 24, the new coronavirus has spread to 29 countries beyond China, according to the WHO's official count. In China, the virus has infected at least 77,262 people and resulted in at least 2,595 deaths. Outside of China, there have been at least 2,069 infections and 23 deaths. That’s a fatality rate closer to 3%.

The WHO declared the virus an international public health emergency in late January, and the group’s director-general has since called it a ""potential pandemic.""

Our ruling

Limbaugh said the 2019 coronavirus is ""the common cold.""

Generally speaking, coronaviruses are a family of viruses that produce illnesses ranging from the common cold to more critical diseases such as SARS or MERS.

But the 2019 coronavirus is a novel strain that was unknown before December. It is different and can be much more dangerous than the common cold.

We rate Limbaugh’s statement False."

But that moment wasn’t at the start of the speech. The RedState journalist who made the original claim had to issue a correction.

Video shows Pelosi taking papers and holding them underneath the desk where she was seating.

One of the most viral moments of President Donald Trump’s 2020 State of the Union address was when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., publicly tore up a copy of his speech.

Republicans called her actions after the speech disrespectful, Democrats celebrated her ripping Trump on national TV. Others engaged in a playground-like ""he started it!"" pointing out Trump did not shake her hand at the outset of the speech.

Now a conservative journalist says her tear was premeditated before Trump started his address.

""Here's Pelosi testing to see if she could rip the speech before the speech even started,"" tweeted Brandon Morse, a senior editor at RedState, on Feb. 5. ""She was planning to do it from the start."" (He credited a Reddit user for the video.)

Two hours later, Morse tweeted a follow-up:

""I need to make a correction. Pelosi actually divided the papers into piles and tested them before ripping them. This exact moment caught here occurred not before Trump's speech began, but 50 minutes into it."" (His article about the video got a correction, too.)

Morse’s initial tweet drew about 40,000 likes or retweets while his ""correction"" tweet drew less than 2,000 likes or retweets by noon the next day. So we wanted to set the record straight about his initial message.

We attempted to reach Morse but did not hear back.

Timing the tear

The video clip that Morse tweeted shows Pelosi turning over the pages of Trump’s speech, but part of her actions are underneath a table and not fully in view. Based on the video alone, we can’t say what she was doing.

Pelosi has indicated her decision came later on in the address.

""He didn’t want to shake hands, That meant nothing to me, that had nothing to do with my tearing up — that came much later,"" she said at the weekly press conference Feb. 6.

Pelosi said she started reading ahead.

""I just went right through that thing so I knew what was coming. When I saw the compilation of falsehoods, when I heard the first quarter or third then I started to think there has to be something that clearly indicates to the American people that this is not the truth and he has shredded the truth in his speech, he is shredding the Constitution in his conduct, I shredded his ‘state of his mind’ address.""

That’s consistent with what was reported as telling Democrats in a closed-door meeting the day after the State of the Union. Those news reports are based on anonymous Democratic aides or people who attended the meeting.

The Hill quoted Pelosi as calling herself a ""speed reader"" who could not let what she saw as a ""pack of lies"" stand. ""So, somewhere along the way, realizing what was coming, I started to stack my papers in a way that were tear-able,"" the Hill quoted her as saying.

ABC News and Reuters had similar accounts, and Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said the quotes are accurate.

Morse’s article mentions The Hill report and then argues that ""she clearly planned to rip the speech before she even knew what was in it.""

The New York Post showed photos that appeared to show tiny tears on the edges of Pelosi’s paper copy. The Post showed an 18-second clip of Pelosi and said she ""pre-ripped."" But this moment was about 46 minutes into his speech when Trump was talking about Rush Limbaugh, not at the start.

Here’s our take after watching Trump’s speech on C-SPAN: The camera was focused on Trump and sometimes the audience, so it doesn’t show Pelosi during every second of his roughly 80-minute speech. Pelosi was seated and her hands aren’t always fully visible. Pelosi sometimes flipped through the papers, appearing to read parts of it. Based on the video of Pelosi, we can't say when she had a thought to rip up his speech.

Our ruling

Morse says a video proves Pelosi ""was planning"" to rip up President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address ""from the start.""

Morse tweeted a video showing Pelosi flipping through a paper copy of Trump’s speech while he spoke. The video clip does not prove Pelosi planned to rip up Trump’s speech.

A couple hours later, Morse tweeted that the video clip was actually 50 minutes into the speech. But his initial tweet drew far more reactions.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., drew the ire of Republicans when she tore up a copy of President Donald Trump’s 2020 State of the Union address.

One conservative pundit said she deserved more than just the ridicule of her GOP colleagues.

""Nancy Pelosi may have just committed a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2071, Section 2071 (a) when she ripped up President Trump’s State of the Union address,"" Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk wrote in a Feb. 4 tweet. ""This violation is punishable by up to three years in prison.""

🤔 — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) February 5, 2020

Kirk’s claim made the rounds on Twitter, with former congressional candidate Carl Higbie, North Carolina Rep. Dan Bishop and Donald Trump Jr. all repeating or retweeting versions of it.

But when we asked a number of legal experts about what Kirk said, we found that their answer was unanimous: Kirk’s claim is wrong.

""I take it that this is a printout of the Trump speech, in which case it is absurd to suggest that Pelosi can be prosecuted for doing with it whatever she pleases,"" said Heidi Kitrosser, a law professor at the University of Minnesota.

Why Pelosi didn’t violate the law

In a statement to PolitiFact, a spokesperson for Kirk cited the federal law Kirk mentioned and a Justice Department webpage summarizing it.

""Anything that comes out of the office of the president is a government document under the Presidential Records Act of 1978,"" the statement said.

The statute in question deals with the ""concealment, removal, or mutilation generally"" of records and reports. It sets a penalty for anyone who ""conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys"" any government record ""filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States.""

The statute also says that any person with ""custody"" of a government record cannot ""willfully and unlawfully"" conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, falsify or destroy it.

""The point of the statute is to prevent people from destroying records in official repositories like the National Archives or in courts,"" said Georgetown Law professor Victoria Nourse.

Pelosi is in the clear, experts said, because her copy of Trump’s speech wasn’t a government record.

The State of the Union text was never ""filed or deposited"" with her, nor did she have ""custody"" of it in the legal sense. Video of the event shows that Trump handed her and Vice President Mike Pence copies before he began speaking, and Pelosi can be seen following along throughout.

""Her copy of the State of the Union address is not a government record or government property at all,"" said Douglas Cox, professor of law at the City University of New York School of Law and an expert in the laws governing the preservation of government records. ""It is personal property.""

Under House rules, members of Congress are encouraged to preserve records or donate them to a research institution for historical study, Cox said. Unlike congressional committees, members are not legally required to hold onto their office’s files.

""They can keep them private, they can destroy them, or they can rip them up,"" he said.

This is in contrast to presidential records, which have been considered government property since the Presidential Records Act of 1978 and are supposed to be stored with the National Archives for safekeeping.

""The State of the Union is a presidential record, which must go to the National Archives under the Presidential Records Act,"" Nourse said ""(Pelosi) did not mutilate the record that is filed with the Archives.""

The purpose of the records law ""is to prevent someone from depriving the government from the use of its documents,"" so Pelosi’s move ""doesn’t fit within the statute,"" added Kathleen Clark, professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis.

There are probably countless copies of Trump’s address, such as the version the White House posted online. Pelosi’s action doesn’t preclude future generations from accessing one.

""If the statute were not read this way, then any copy of the State of the Union held by anyone could never be destroyed,"" Nourse said.

For what it’s worth, Trump has a habit of ripping up papers when he’s done with them. According to Politico, staff members have had to tape Trump’s shredded files together in order to send them to the Archives and avoid crossing the Presidential Records Act.

Our ruling

Kirk said, ""Nancy Pelosi may have just committed a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2071, Section 2071 (a) when she ripped up President Trump’s State of the Union address.""

Experts told us that’s a misapplication of a law. The papers Pelosi ripped up did not belong to the government, nor were they the only copy of Trump’s speech in existence.

Pelosi didn't introduce Trump at all ahead of his 2019 State of the Union. Looking at the video, it appears Trump started his speech before Pelosi could formally introduce him.

Between the 2007 and 2018 addresses, every speaker has said something very close to the following: “Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.”

Following President Donald Trump’s 2020 State of the Union Address, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., ripped up a copy of Trump’s speech in full view of the cameras. But earlier, she made a less dramatic deviation from protocol.

CNN host Jake Tapper noted the shift in his post-speech analysis, as well as in a tweet that attracted more than 36,000 likes.

Tapper wrote, ""Traditionally, the Speaker says: ‘Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States.’ (Tonight) Speaker Pelosi said, ‘Members of Congress, the President of the United States.’ ""

Tapper is right, we found.

We looked back at all of the speaker-president interactions in State of the Union addresses going back to 2007, which was Pelosi’s first as speaker. (The 2009 and 2017 addresses are technically not considered State of the Union addresses, but we counted them too.)

Between the 2007 and 2018 addresses, every speaker has said something very close to the following: ""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.""

Here’s the rundown, with links to the video.

2007: Pelosi to President George W. Bush:

""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.""

2008: Pelosi to Bush:

""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.""

2009: Pelosi to President Barack Obama:

""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.""

2018: Ryan to Trump:

""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.""

The Pelosi-Trump interactions

The pattern changed abruptly in 2019, with Trump as president and Pelosi as speaker.

In 2019, Pelosi didn’t say anything before Trump started speaking. It’s unclear whether there was a miscommunication, but Pelosi insisted to reporters later that ""there was no snub. It went quickly, I guess.""

In 2020, Pelosi did say part of the phrase — but as Tapper noted, it was just a part. She said: ""Members of Congress, the president of the United States.""

Pelosi’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.

Our ruling

Tapper tweeted, ""Traditionally, the Speaker says: ‘Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States.’ (Tonight) Speaker Pelosi said, ‘Members of Congress, the President of the United States.’ ""

Between 2007 and 2018, Pelosi and her successors used that language or something close, regardless of the party affiliations of the speaker and the president.

In 2019, for unclear reasons, Pelosi didn’t speak before Trump started. This year, she did, but she left out the part about a ""high privilege and distinct honor.""

A report from a conservative group tried to use a disparity between registered voters and voting-age adults in Iowa as evidence of potential voter fraud in the caucuses. But Iowa’s secretary of state said the numbers are wrong.

One day before the Iowa caucuses, a conservative activist started making claims on Twitter about alleged voter fraud.

""It’s been revealed that EIGHT Iowa counties have more adults registered to vote than voting-aged adults living there,"" tweeted Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, Feb. 2. ""Don’t let voter fraud steal the 2020 election.""

The tweet was flagged by VineSight, an organization that uses artificial intelligence to surface potential misinformation, and also appears on Facebook.

The allegations from Kirk and another conservative organization aim to stir up concerns about voter fraud with a questionable methodology that leads to unsubstantiated conclusions. On Caucus Day, Iowa election officials issued public statements denouncing their numbers and the narrative.

The current data released by Iowa election officials don’t support Kirk’s tweet.

Iowa disputes report

Kirk’s viral tweet makes the same claim as a Feb. 3 report published by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group.

The Judicial Watch report says ""eight Iowa counties have more voter registrations than their eligible voting-age population."" Two of them, Johnson and Scott counties, are the locations of Davenport and Iowa City, respectively.

The report was based on its analysis of data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.

""Dirty voting rolls can mean dirty elections and Iowa needs to undertake a serious effort to address its voting rolls,"" said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton in the news release.

RELATED: We fact-checked the Democrats' closing push in Iowa before the caucuses

Iowa officials refuted the report. A Feb. 3 news release from Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate said his office’s data ""shows this information to be false.""

""It’s unfortunate this organization continues to put out inaccurate data regarding voter registration, and it’s especially disconcerting they chose the day of the Iowa Caucus to do this,"" Pate said in the statement. ""My office has told the organization, and others who have made similar claims, that their data regarding Iowa is deeply flawed and their false claims erode voter confidence in elections.""

We reached out to Kirk and Judicial Watch for comment, but neither has responded with one. It appears they were using old voter registration numbers..

An ‘apples-to-oranges measure’

We took a look at the most recent voter registration and population data from Iowa’s government and the Census Bureau. The numbers don’t support what Kirk said, and experts say comparing them is flawed.

Among the counties identified by Judicial Watch, none have more active registered voters than adults.

For example, Scott County — the largest county included in the Judicial Watch story — has an estimated population of 131,961 people ages 18 and older, according to 2018 data from the Census’s American Community Survey. According to the Iowa secretary of state, there are 127,737 total voter registrations, 115,393 of which are active.

Judicial Watch’s story looked at ""total registrations,"" which includes inactive voters. In Iowa, inactive voters are those that have not responded to notices from the state asking them to verify their registration and residence.

Only one county, Lyon, has more total registered voters than adults: 8,490 to 8,430. But that data is from 2018. The Iowa secretary of state’s office says 8,117 of voters in Lyon County are active.

Either way, experts say comparing voter rolls and Census estimates isn’t an accurate measurement of registration rates.

""That’s an apples-to-oranges measure. They measure different things, at different times, with different types of levels of certainty,"" said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor, in an email. ""And so it’s really bad science to claim that a disconnect between those two numbers means that there’s fraud.""

Even if there were more registered voters than voting-age adults in some Iowa counties, experts told us it would not amount to voter fraud.

""For there to be voter fraud in connection to bloated voter rolls, you’d have to see people going to the polling places and see them voting in places of people who have moved or died,"" said Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine. ""Not only would that be a difficult thing to do … you’d have to do this on a wide enough scale to sway an election without being able to verify how the people you’ve paid to do this have voted.""

Voter fraud remains rare in American elections. A database maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation has documented 17 confirmed instances of voter fraud in Iowa dating back to 2011.

Our ruling

A tweet from Charlie Kirk claims that ""EIGHT Iowa counties have more adults registered to vote than voting-aged adults living there.""

Voter registration data and a statement from Iowa’s secretary of state, as well as population estimates from the Census Bureau, refute that claim. And experts say comparing voter data to population estimates isn’t a good measure of registration rates in the first place.

Kirk’s tweet is inaccurate. We rate it False."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/18/tucker-carlson/carlson-falsely-claims-immigrants-are-dirtying-pot/,2019-12-18T00:00:00,Tucker Carlson falsely claims immigrants are dirtying the Potomac River,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson ripped into immigrants in the nation’s capital, accusing them without evidence of contaminating the Potomac River.

In an interview with the Atlantic, Carlson said he’s been fishing in the river, which stretches from West Virginia into the Chesapeake Bay, for almost 35 years.

""It has gotten dirtier and dirtier and dirtier and dirtier,"" he said. ""I go down there, and that litter is left almost exclusively by immigrants.""

Asked how he knew immigrants were to blame, Carlson added: ""Because I’m there. I watch it.""

We found that Carlson’s claim is at odds with data collected by activists devoted to keeping the Potomac clean, who told us that the river has actually gotten cleaner over time.

Plus, there’s no evidence that immigrants are especially to blame for any trash floating around the river’s waters. (Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.)

Cleaner and cleaner, not dirtier and dirtier

The Potomac River has long been considered too polluted for swimming, particularly in and around Washington, D.C., where Carlson lives. Its waters were so bad that in 1965, former President Lyndon Johnson declared the river a ""national disgrace.""

But a 2018 report from the Potomac Conservancy, a nonprofit clean-water advocate in the region, found that the Potomac’s overall health has improved dramatically in the last 10 years.

Hedrick Belin, president of the group, blasted Carlson for his ""groundless accusation"" in a statement to PolitiFact, calling the Fox News host’s comments ""factually incorrect"" and ""racist.""

""For the first time in generations, we are within reach of fully enjoying a healthy, thriving Potomac River,"" Belin said, noting that river pollutants are in decline as fish are returning.

Other experts agreed. ""This is a river that's getting cleaner and cleaner, not 'dirtier and dirtier,'"" said Philip Musegaas, vice president of programs and litigation for the Potomac Riverkeeper Network. The nonprofit called Carlson’s claim ""dead wrong"" in a Facebook post.

Musegaas said plans to upgrade the sewer systems in Washington and Alexandria, Va., should eliminate the ""last sources of untreated sewage pollution"" in the nearby metropolitan area.

Curtis Dalpra, communications manager for the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin, said different environmental issues affect different parts of the river, which is more than 380 miles long. But generally speaking, the river is cleaner than it was 30 years ago.

Still, Carlson was talking specifically about litter, so we also reached out to the Alice Ferguson Foundation, which organizes annual trash cleanups along the riverside and keeps tabs on the total amount of trash and recyclables its volunteers haul out of the Potomac’s shores each year.

According to the foundation’s data, less litter was collected in 2019 than in 2007, even as the number of volunteers increased. Specifically, the number of trash-and-recyclable-filled bags per volunteer dropped from an average of 2.14 bags in 2007 to 1.20 in 2019.

At Fletchers’ Cove — a spot that, according to the Washington Post, is roughly a 10-minute drive from Carlson’s house — the average number of bags-per-volunteer went from roughly 2.11 in 2007 to about 1.32 in 2019.

Litter isn’t the main problem

Local experts also cast doubt on Carlson’s claim that immigrant litter was at fault.

For starters, litter is not the top pollutant soiling the Potomac River’s waters. Belin said nutrients and sediment that flow off the land are the main causes for concern. When they hit the water, they harm wildlife, degrade habitats and taint the water, making it less clean and safe.

Litter is still an issue. But foreign-born people — who make up roughly 14% of the population in Washington, D.C., according to the Census Bureau — are not uniquely prone to littering.

""Littering is definitely a problem, but it is a problem that knows no color or ethnicity,"" Musegaas said. ""Tourists litter, residents litter, and people fishing and boating on the river litter.""

Not only that, but most of the trash that ends up in the Potomac River is not deposited directly, experts said. Often, trash left in the street or outside in barrels gets swept by rain into the sewer or the river.

Of course, that trash has to come from someone, Dalpra noted. At some point, it was thrown on the ground or stuffed in the trash. And in a dense city like Washington, there’s likely more litter to go around than elsewhere. But that litter ""is really a problem that spans society,"" Dalpra said.

While we won’t discount the possibility that Carlson has spotted immigrants tossing trash in the Potomac, there’s no evidence that the litter ""is left almost exclusively by immigrants.""

Our ruling

Carlson said the Potomac River ""has gotten dirtier and dirtier and dirtier and dirtier. I go down there and that litter is left almost exclusively by immigrants.""

The available data shows the opposite; the Potomac has actually gotten cleaner. And there’s no evidence to suggest that immigrants are most responsible for the remaining litter in the river.

https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/12/paul-gigot/donald-trump-would-be-first-us-president-impeached/,2019-12-12T00:00:00,Would Donald Trump be the first president impeached without a cited crime?,"In the days before articles of impeachment were unveiled against President Donald Trump, Wall Street Journal editorial page editor Paul Gigot claimed that a Trump impeachment would be the first of its kind.

Speaking on the ""Journal Editorial Report,"" a show he hosts on Fox News Channel, Gigot attributed his information to George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley.

""This would be the first impeachment in American history — if it proceeds, as it will — without a specific criminal statute or crime that the president who is impeached would have allegedly committed,"" Gigot said.

Trump roughly quoted Gigot’s statement in a tweet the next day.

Neither of the two prior presidential impeachments cited specific criminal violations. But in one instance, a possible prison term was in play and in the other, a felony crime was alleged, though not formally charged. In addition, experts say impeachment isn’t based on citing a particular criminal statute.

""Every scholar concedes that the presence or absence of a federal crime is beside the point when it comes to constitutional high crimes and misdemeanors,"" said Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, co-author of ""To End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment.""

Gigot and Turley

The presidents who have been formally impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives were Andrew Johnson, in 1868, and Bill Clinton, in 1998. Both were acquitted in the U.S. Senate and remained in office.

(Richard Nixon faced three articles of impeachment, but he resigned in 1974 before the House could take a vote on impeaching him.)

Turley testified in the impeachment proceedings against impeaching Trump, saying: ""We have never impeached a president solely or even largely on the basis of a non-criminal abuse of power.""

Gigot and Turley did not respond to our requests for additional information.

Constitutional law attorney David Rivkin said on Gigot’s show that he agreed with Gigot. Rivkin told us by email that Johnson violated a federal statute and Nixon and Clinton were ""credibly accused of violating specific criminal law violations,"" but Trump has not.

Johnson faced possible prison term

In the context of Gigot’s statement, Johnson’s impeachment is tricky, even though he was not charged with violating any criminal code.

By firing his secretary of war without Senate approval, Johnson allegedly violated the Tenure of Office Act, a civil statute that was later repealed. The statute carried a possible fine of up to $10,000, or prison for up to five years, or both.

But ""no one was seriously threatening to put Johnson behind bars,"" said University of North Carolina professor of law Michael Gerhardt, who testified in support of Trump’s impeachment and is the author of ""Impeachment: What Everyone Needs to Know.""

Clinton was accused of perjury

Clinton’s impeachment also did not cite a specific criminal violation, but his conduct was allegedly criminal in that he was accused of committing perjury.

The two articles of impeachment said Clinton ""willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony"" to a grand jury related to the Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky sexual harassment cases, and that he obstructed justice related to the lawsuits against him.

""Bill Clinton lied to a grand jury,"" said Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner in the Dec. 12 Judiciary Committee hearing. ""That is a crime.""

Trump accused of abuse of power

The impeachment articles against Trump do not cite a specific crime or criminal statute.

Trump is accused of abuse of power for his alleged efforts to strong-arm Ukraine into investigating his potential Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, by withholding military aid and an Oval Office visit; and of obstruction of Congress, for his efforts to block cooperation with Congress on its impeachment inquiry.

""Like the Clinton and Nixon articles, they don’t allege a particular statutory criminal violation by name, but they do allege facts that could be charged as a crime in an ordinary court,"" said Frank Bowman, author of ""High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump"" and a University of Missouri law professor.

The first article against Trump ""contains language drawn from bribery law, even though it doesn’t use the word bribery,"" Bowman said.

Our ruling

Gigot said if Trump is impeached, this would be the first impeachment in U.S. history ""without a specific criminal statute or crime that the president who is impeached would have allegedly committed.""

The two presidents who have been impeached, Johnson and Clinton, were not charged with violating any criminal code. But that is only part of the story: Johnson was accused of breaking a law that carried a possible prison sentence, and Clinton was accused of the crime of perjury.

The claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate the claim Half True."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/nov/04/mike-shields/subpoenas-vs-bills-what-cnn-pundit-got-wrong/,2019-11-04T00:00:00,Subpoenas vs. bills: What this CNN pundit got wrong,"CNN commentator Mike Shields took aim at House Democrats during a recent on-air panel, claiming they have spent more time pursuing President Donald Trump’s impeachment than legislating.

""The Democrats are frittering away their majority,"" said Shields, the former chief of staff for the Republican National Committee and founder of the communications firm Convergence Media, in an Oct. 31 appearance on CNN. ""They have issued more subpoenas than they’ve passed bills.""

Shields’ claim parrots a similar attack that has made the rounds among conservative pundits and Republican lawmakers as the House continues its probe into Trump’s actions on Ukraine.

The claim has roots in an Oct. 22 article from the Washington Times, which said that under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Democrats have issued 56 subpoenas while passing just 46 bills that went on to become laws.

But while other Republicans specified that the Washington Times article counted congressional subpoenas against House bills that were ultimately signed into law, Shields was less precise, instead comparing subpoenas issued to bills passed.

In fact, House Democrats have helped pass more than 500 bills and resolutions, although many have not made their way to Trump’s desk. When we reached out to Shields, he said he ""misspoke,"" and he later clarified his point on Twitter.

""I meant to say more subpoenas than laws that have been passed, not bills,"" he told us.

Mea Culpa - I misspoke on @TheLeadCNN yesterday when I said House Democrats have issued more subpoenas than they have passed bills. It's more subpoenas than they have had laws *passed/signed*. Still a valid point about their wasted majority but want to be accurate https://t.co/I1k5aMe3no — Mike Shields (@mshields007) November 1, 2019

Even this revised claim gives a misleading impression, however. Experts said it’s meaningless to compare subpoenas with House bills enacted into law, because while a committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, there are more hurdles when it comes to legislation.

Counting House-backed laws can be misleading

The Washington Times counted 56 publicly acknowledged subpoenas that House Democrats issued between the start of their majority and the article’s Oct. 22 publication, including 15 related to the impeachment inquiry.

The report’s authors did not respond to requests for comment, but their subpoena tally lines up with what other news outlets have reported. By our count, the House has subpoenaed at least 24 people to date as part of the impeachment inquiry.

Pelosi spokesperson Ashley Etienne said she believes the House has issued approximately 47 in total, adding that many were due to ""stonewalling of the current administration and Trump’s posture of refusing to respond to congressional requests, inquiries and subpoenas.""

Etienne also pointed out that during President Bill Clinton’s administration, Republicans in the majority issued more than 1,000 subpoenas.

The Washington Times said the House has introduced and passed 46 bills-turned-laws since Democrats took over in January. According to Congress.gov, that’s accurate: There are 43 bills and 3 joint resolutions that originated in the House, passed the Senate and were signed into law by Trump.

But Josh Tauberer, president of GovTrack.us, a nonpartisan website that tracks government and congressional data, said the number of House bills that become law is not a reliable indicator of how hard the House is working to legislate.

That’s because bills are often introduced in pairs, with the House and Senate each proposing their own versions. ""But which one is enacted is up to chance and doesn't indicate that only legislators in one chamber put in any effort,"" Tauberer said.

Not only that, but the text of a bill is often replaced as it goes through the legislative process, meaning ""the chamber that a bill originated in, and a bill's original sponsor, may have no connection to the substance of the bill when it is enacted,"" he said.

This year, the House and Senate have combined to pass 66 bills that earned Trump’s signature, according to Congress.gov. But Tauberer said Pelosi’s House has voted on about 1,200 pages of new law and roughly 200 unique legislative proposals that ended up in those enacted laws.

The House can’t make laws by itself

Experts said the biggest problem with the subpoenas-to-bills comparison is the lack of attention it pays to the Senate’s role in sending House-backed bills to the president’s desk.

""The House can't pass ‘bills into law’ by itself,"" said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University.

According to Congress.gov, the House has passed or agreed to 522 bills and resolutions since January. But the Senate hasn’t acted on many of them. In July, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., vowed to block Democrats’ progressive policy proposals, telling an audience to ""think of me as the grim reaper.""

The GOP doesn’t have the same blocking power when it comes to subpoenas, however.

""We are talking about two completely different processes,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, a Washington think tank. ""A committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, whereas it takes a majority of House members and senators to enact a law. The latter is a much bigger hump to surmount.""

Of course, Shields’ botched version of the comparison is even more wrong, since he originally said there have been more subpoenas than bills passed, which simply isn’t true.

Our ruling

Shields said Democrats ""have issued more subpoenas than they’ve passed bills.""

That’s wrong, and Shields clarified his point on Twitter. But the claim that House Democrats are responsible for more subpoenas than bills passed into law is also misleading, since it compares two very different processes.

We rate this statement False."

More than 40 Republican lawmakers disrupted witness testimony on Oct. 23 by storming a secure room and chanting, ""Let us in!"" Many news outlets and top Democrats quickly pointed out that roughly a dozen of the protesting Republicans already had access to the depositions they were demanding to hear.

Still, Limbaugh and others have charged that Republicans have been shut out of the House’s impeachment inquiry into Trump’s actions on Ukraine.

""The thing that, of course, is top-drawer today and has been all week is what little Adam pencil-neck Schiff is doing behind closed doors in a so-called impeachment inquiry that doesn’t feature the opposition party, it doesn’t feature cross-examination, no transcripts are released, everything’s being done in private, only selected leaks, you know the drill,"" Limbaugh said Oct. 25 on his radio show.

Limbaugh’s comments were made before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision Oct. 28 to bring the probe to a more open phase, starting with an Oct. 31 vote on a resolution to affirm the ongoing investigation and start public hearings.

Limbaugh, who did not respond to requests for comment, has a point that the impeachment hearings have so far taken place behind closed doors, without transcripts being formally released. (News outlets have obtained transcripts of prepared witness remarks in some cases.)

But he is wrong that the hearings have excluded House Republicans, 47 of whom sit on the three committees that have been leading the investigation.

Participation is based on committee, not party

The Constitution says little about procedures for impeachment: The House ""shall have the sole Power of Impeachment"" and the Senate ""shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.""

In three previous impeachments, the full House authorized inquiries and the House Judiciary Committee took the lead in conducting investigations, holding hearings and voting on whether to approve articles of impeachment.

This time around, Pelosi opened the inquiry without a formal vote, a move Republicans criticized. She instructed three House committees — Oversight, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs — to carry out an investigation that the House Judiciary Committee will use to draft any articles of impeachment.

There are nine Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, 17 are on the House Oversight Committee, and 21 are on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. By contrast, those three committees feature 13, 23 and 26 Democrats, respectively, with four Democrats sitting on two of them at the same time.

All 47 of those Republicans have been able to participate and ask questions in the interviews and depositions held to this point, said Ashley Etienne, Pelosi’s communications director, in an email. Experts told us the same thing.

Other House members, such as Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who organized the Oct. 23 protest, have been kept out of the hearings not because they are Republicans, but because they are not on the relevant committees. And some, such as Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida, have chosen not to attend despite being able to.

There is no constitutional provision that says a president or his allies must be allowed to cross-examine witnesses during a House impeachment inquiry.

""Nothing in either the Constitution or House rules requires public hearings and/or cross-examination at this stage,"" said Ilya Somin, professor of law at George Mason University.

When Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the inquiry was denying Trump ""due process accorded every American,"" we rated his statement False. If such rights apply at all, they would be granted during the Senate’s trial phase.

""The House impeachment inquiry is equivalent to a grand jury investigation in a criminal case,"" said Suzanna Sherry, professor of law at Vanderbilt University. ""And there is no opportunity for cross-examination when evidence is presented to the grand jury.""

Republicans also have the ability to ask questions of witnesses at hearings, Sherry said, which is ""more opportunity for cross-examination than is given to a target of a grand jury investigation.""

""By any ordinary definition, that would amount to ‘cross-examination,’"" said Frank O. Bowman III, professor of law at the University of Missouri and the author of a book on impeachment.

Our ruling

Limbaugh said House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry ""doesn’t feature the opposition party, it doesn’t feature cross-examination.""

Republicans on the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees — 47 in total — have been able to participate in hearings organized as part of the impeachment inquiry.

The next day, Fox News political commentator and legal analyst Andrew Napolitano sought to correct them.

Before even being asked a question, Napolitano began his Oct. 24 appearance on ""Fox & Friends"" with a statement about the hearings being led by U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of one of three House committees holding the hearings.

""I read the House rules,"" the former New Jersey judge said. ""And as frustrating as it may be to have these hearings going on behind closed doors — the hearings over which Congressman Schiff is presiding — they are consistent with the rules.""

He’s right.

Impeachment 101

Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry following a whistleblower’s report suggesting that Trump withheld U.S. military aid from Ukraine to pressure the country into investigating his political rival, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

A president can be impeached if his or her acts are inconsistent with their presidential duties, whether or not it violates criminal law. It is the job of the House to decide whether there’s enough evidence to show that Trump committed an impeachable offense. First, articles of impeachment would have to pass the full U.S. House of Representatives with a simple majority. Those articles would then be sent to the Senate for a trial. A two-thirds Senate vote is required to convict — that is, remove — the president.

Impeachment is part of the U.S. Constitution. But the rules and procedures for an impeachment are not written in the Constitution, or in a statute; they depend largely on historical precedent.

Napolitano’s position

After making his statement on ""Fox & Friends,"" Napolitano went on to explain that the impeachment inquiry rules were adopted in 2015 by House Republicans and allow for initial interviews of witnesses to be done in secret, much like a criminal case is presented to a grand jury. Any formal impeachment hearing, he added, would have to be done in public, as would a Senate trial.

When we asked a Fox News representative for information to support Napolitano’s statement, she sent the following from Napolitano:

""The House rules permit committee chairs to hold closed hearings on matters of national security or intelligence. Diplomatic matters implicate both national security and intelligence. The rules also permit standing committees – as opposed to the full House – to issue subpoenas. As well, they permit interviews of witnesses in secret in order to determine if they are credible enough to present in public.""

Heritage Foundation senior legal fellow Hans von Spakovsky told us that according to the House of Representatives’ House Practice book, ""an impeachment is normally instituted by the House by the adoption of a resolution calling for a committee investigation of charges."" And no such resolution was done in this inquiry.

But the day after Napolitano’s interview, a federal judge in Washington ruled that the impeachment inquiry is legal.

And Napolitano’s statement was not about in the inquiry generally, but whether interviews can be done in private.

Experts agree with Napolitano

Frank Bowman, a University of Missouri professor of law and author of ""High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump,"" told us the hearings are not ""secret"" in that they are open to members of the three House committees (roughly 100 lawmakers), along with their staff. Bowman pointed us to the 2015 House rules that allow for the private questioning of witnesses in impeachment inquiries.

The rules say House meetings shall be open to the public except when a committee or subcommittee, in open session and with a majority present, ""determines by record vote that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on that day shall be in executive session because disclosure of matters to be considered would endanger national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person, or otherwise would violate a law or rule of the House.""

Jeffrey Engel, founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University and co-author of ""Impeachment: An American History,"" underscored the House’s wide latitude.

He told PolitiFact that from a constitutional standpoint, ""the House can choose whatever rules it wants for impeachment hearings—just as the Senate will be able to do the same for its trial, relying on precedent but not bound by it.""

One more point before we close.

When Republicans controlled the House, its Benghazi committee held nearly all of its hearings behind closed doors, Allan Lichtman, American University history professor and author of ""The Case for Impeachment,"" noted to us. He also pointed out that in the final House report on the matter, then-Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, said:

""The committee’s preference for private interviews over public hearings has been questioned. Interviews are a more efficient and effective means of discovery. Interviews allow witnesses to be questioned in depth by a highly prepared member or staff person. In a hearing, every member of a committee is recognized — usually for five minutes — a procedure which precludes in-depth in-depth focused questioning. Interviews also allow the committee to safeguard the privacy of witnesses who may fear retaliation for cooperating or whose work requires anonymity, such as intelligence community operatives.""

Our ruling

Napolitano said: ""I read the House rules. And as frustrating as it may be to have these hearings going on behind closed doors—the (impeachment inquiry) hearings over which Congressman Schiff is presiding—they are consistent with the rules.""

House rules give House committees wide latitude in how to conduct impeachment inquiries and they allow for witnesses to be questioned with only members of the committees and their staffs present.

We rate Napolitano’s statement True."

The team is led by White House attorneys Pat Cipollone and Jay Sekulow. It’s also headlined by household names such as Ken Starr, whose investigations led to President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998.

Other members on the roster include former independent counsel Robert Ray, Harvard law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, presidential adviser Pam Bondi, private counsel Jane Raskin and attorney Eric Hershmann of the Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP law firm.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment, but CNN reported that Trump wanted a star-studded team capable of performing on TV.

Starr, Ray, Dershowitz and Bondi have all spent plenty of time in the spotlight, including on Fox News, the president’s preferred cable network.

Together, they have made at least 365 Fox News appearances since January 2019, according to Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog that monitors the network.

""Trump likes people who are already famous and who defend him on TV,"" said Frank O. Bowman III, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Law and the author of a book on impeachment. ""No sensible counselor would pick Starr, Dershowitz or Bondi.""

Here’s what you need to know about Trump’s made-for-TV defense lineup.

Ken Starr

Current role: Starr was a Fox News contributor until joining Trump’s defense team.

Background: Starr was the independent counsel who led the investigations that resulted in Clinton’s impeachment in 1998. He is a former U.S. solicitor general and federal circuit court judge.

Starr also spent time as president of Baylor University, but he was forced to step down in 2016 for allegedly mishandling several claims of sexual assault.

Bowman said Starr’s participation will invite comparisons with Clinton’s impeachment trial, when Starr argued strongly in favor of hearing from relevant witnesses.

What he’s said: Starr has appeared on Fox News roughly 125 times since January 2019, according to Media Matters. Trump has quoted him four times on Twitter since the launch of the House’s impeachment inquiry in September.

On Fox News, Starr has repeatedly downplayed Trump’s impeachment as politically motivated and weak.

""It really is not a strong case,"" he said in one appearance that Trump tweeted about. ""This will go down as the most partisan impeachment in the history of the republic.""

""Does it reach the level of treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors? My assessment of the evidence thus far (is) nowhere close,"" he said in another appearance that earned a Trump tweet. ""The evidence is conflicting and ambiguous.""

Starr has argued that European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland’s testimony that Trump said he wanted ""no quid pro quo"" undermines other evidence that the White House conditioned military aid to Ukraine on the country’s willingness to investigate Trump's political rivals.

In an interview with the Washington Examiner’s Byron York, Starr called impeachment a ""terrible thorn in the side of the American democracy.""

Robert Ray

Attorney Robert Ray speaks with reporters outside the U.S. District Courthouse in Seattle on Aug. 15, 2014. (AP/Johnson)

Current role: Ray is a private practice attorney.

Background: Ray succeeded Starr as independent counsel and wrapped up the investigations into Clinton. Before that, he served as assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. In 2006, he was charged with stalking a woman he had once dated.

What he’s said: Ray has made at least 70 Fox News appearances since January 2019, per Media Matters. Trump has quoted him on Twitter three times since the House inquiry began.

In one interview on Fox News, Ray described the impeachment inquiry as ""an entirely partisan effort"" and said ""there’s not any accusation of a crime, much less evidence of one.""

""This is a political effort,"" he said in another segment that won Trump’s praise on Twitter. ""The president certainly doesn’t have to aid in the impeachment effort.""

Ray also minimized a press conference in which acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney seemed to admit to a quid pro quo involving military aid to Ukraine.

""A contentious press briefing is not the place to be trying to sort out whether there is or is not an illegal quid pro quo,"" he told Fox News host Laura Ingraham.

Since joining Trump’s legal defense team, Ray has said that Trump’s impeachment is ""an illegitimate effort by House Democrats to remove a president from office.""

Alan Dershowitz

Attorney Alan Dershowitz leaves federal court in New York on Dec. 2, 2019. (AP/Drew)

Current role: Dershowitz is a professor emeritus at Harvard University and an author.

Background: Dershowitz became famous for representing high-profile defendants such as O.J. Simpson, boxer Mike Tyson and Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who died by suicide in prison. His defense of Claus von Bulow for the attempted murder of his wife Sonny von Bulow was made into the 1990 movie ""Reversal of Fortune.""

What he’s said: Dershowitz has appeared about 110 times on Fox News since January 2019, per Media Matters. We counted four times that Trump has cited him on Twitter since the start of the impeachment inquiry.

On Twitter, Dershowitz said he is participating in Trump’s defense ""to defend the integrity of the Constitution and to prevent the creation of a dangerous constitutional precedent.""

On Fox News, he has said that impeaching Trump for his conduct toward Ukraine would be ""unconstitutional"" and that Trump’s actions are not ""close to being an impeachable offense.""

""There are no impeachable offenses,"" Dershowitz said in one Fox News appearance that Trump tweeted about. ""I don't think he could be impeached for the conduct that's been alleged.""

Dershowitz told CNN and ABC that he would be arguing that Trump cannot be impeached on charges that don’t outline a specific crime, telling ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that Trump should not be impeached even if all the House’s evidence is accepted as fact.

Pam Bondi

Current role: Bondi is a special adviser to Trump.

Background: A former prosecutor, she served as Florida’s attorney general from 2011 to 2019. She’s been on the Truth-O-Meter a number of times.

In 2016, Bondi chose not to pursue fraud allegations against Trump University after the Trump Foundation sent an improper donation to a campaign group connected to her.

What she’s said: Bondi has appeared about 60 times on Fox News since January 2019, according to Media Matters. As a presidential adviser, she has helped Trump with messaging throughout the impeachment process.

""This process has been a sham from the beginning,"" Bondi said in December on ""Fox & Friends."" ""The president did everything right.""

""This should not even go to a vote,"" she later told Fox News host Martha MacCallum. ""There is nothing there.""

We’ve fact-checked Bondi’s impeachment-related claims a few times, including when she wrongly claimed that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff kicked Republicans out of the House’s closed-door hearings."

We decided to dig into the archives and examine Gabbard’s record as a guest on Fox News, a network considered friendly to Trump and his Republican allies.

Saying Gabbard was on Fox ""full time"" seems like an exaggeration, but Gabbard did make frequent appearances on the network during Obama’s second term. And she often bashed the former president’s foreign policy in the process.

As for Harris, she appeared just once on ""Hannity"" in 2009 to talk about health care while she was San Francisco’s district attorney, we found.

A frequent Fox News guest

Gabbard’s arrival in Congress overlapped with the start of Obama’s second term. From 2013 to 2017, she became a regular guest on Fox News. It’s important to note that Gabbard was appearing as a sitting member of Congress, not as a pundit

Searching the Nexis database, we counted more than 20 appearances Gabbard made on Fox News while Obama was in office. That does not include times when she was mentioned on Fox News or featured in video clips the network’s hosts played on air.

She was interviewed by a number of current and former Fox News hosts, from anchor Greta Van Susteren to talk show host Tucker Carlson.

Gabbard criticized Obama’s foreign policy

Gabbard’s anti-war foreign policy views have long put her at odds with members of both parties who believe the United States should have an active hand in resolving international issues.

As she campaigns for the White House, Gabbard has promised to fight for peace and stay out of what she calls ""regime-change wars"" overseas.

Not surprisingly, her early appearances on Fox News were often critical of the Obama administration’s actions to combat terrorism and manage other issues in the Middle East.

In a September 2013 interview with Van Susteren, Gabbard said she was against military strikes as Obama was weighing whether to authorize them against the Syrian government.

In June 2014 and August 2014 interviews on the same show, she shared concerns about Obama’s decisions to send military advisers to Iraq and target the Islamic State with airstrikes.

Gabbard ramped up her appearances in 2015, going on Fox News several times to blast Obama over his refusal to refer to the Islamic State’s beliefs and terrorism as ""Islamic extremism"" or ""radical Islam.""

""Unless you clearly identify your enemy, then you cannot come up with a very effective strategy to defeat that enemy,"" she told host Neil Cavuto on Jan. 21, 2015.

""This is not just about words. It's not about semantics,"" she told Van Susteren days later. ""It's really about having a real, true understanding of who our enemy is and how important that is.""

She later criticized the administration’s strategy to defeat ISIS, telling Van Susteren that ""the White House needs to change its policy"" and give more support to U.S. allies in the Middle East.

And she repeatedly appeared on Fox News to argue that the United States should not work to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, at one point warning that removing Assad would leave Syria as a repeat of ""the failed Libyan state"" she said Obama’s foreign policy helped produce.

Gabbard touched on other topics in foreign policy, as well. She weighed in on Israel and the then-ongoing negotiations with Iran over the country’s efforts to build nuclear weapons, which she said should result in a deal that allowed Iranian sites to be inspected without warning.

She also stepped outside of the foreign policy arena, at one point condemning the Democratic National Committee for allegedly disinviting her from a primary debate in October 2015, while she was the committee’s vice chair, and offering the then-candidates debate advice.

But even then, her advice to candidates sounded like a swipe against Obama when she said they should answer questions on Syria by speaking out against Turkey’s ""targeting"" of the United States’ Kurdish allies in the region.

""The fact that the administration has stood silently by and allowed this to happen, including NATO, I think it's important for those candidates on the stage tonight to address this situation and to address how they will approach this and taking action,"" she said.

Gabbard has returned to Fox News more than a few times this go-around, joining Carlson and fellow talk show host Sean Hannity to discuss her foreign policy views, the criteria for qualifying for this year’s Democratic debates and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s suggestion that Gabbard is a ""Russian asset."""

Here’s what we know about the journalist whose stories shaped the Ukraine saga,"Top diplomats have repeatedly linked President Donald Trump’s posture toward Ukraine to John Solomon, the journalist whose reports gave false credence to a number of Ukraine-related conspiracies that have found a receptive audience in Trump and some of his closest allies.

Solomon, 52, had been working until recently as an opinion writer at The Hill and is now a Fox News contributor. His columns were cited three times in the whistleblower complaint that helped spur House Democrats to open their impeachment investigation into Trump.

They’ve remained a focal point as the House investigates whether the Trump administration withheld military aid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to publicly commit to an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and the 2016 election.

On Nov. 19, House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., opened the second week of public impeachment hearings by citing Solomon’s scoops and findings as fact.

""Solomon’s reporting on Burisma, Hunter Biden and Ukraine election meddling has become inconvenient for the Democratic narrative,"" Nunes said in his statement, which came just one day after The Hill announced it would be reviewing, annotating and correcting Solomon’s columns.

So, who is John Solomon? The veteran Washington, D.C., reporter has become a regular on Fox News and a go-to source of information for Trump. A series of springtime articles he published about Ukraine helped kickstart the events at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.

His columns alleged corruption by Biden and a former ambassador and accused Democrats of working with Ukraine to hurt Trump’s chances in 2016. They gained traction as Trump, his allies and various Fox News hosts talked about them on TV and social media.

Solomon did not respond to requests for comment sent to his Facebook page and personal lawyer. Fox News also did not respond to requests for comment.

Who is John Solomon?

Solomon worked for years at the Associated Press and briefly at the Washington Post before moving to the Washington Times, where he was editor in chief. He later spent time at Circa and the Center for Public Integrity before joining The Hill in 2017.

Solomon won an award in 2002 for a series on what law enforcement knew ahead of the Sept. 11 attacks. But media critics also questioned his early work, saying he had a ""history of bending the truth to his storyline"" and ""massaging facts to conjure phantom scandals.""

Solomon’s commentary for The Hill has generated the most buzz. In 2017, he played a major role in pushing the inaccurate Uranium One conspiracy, alleging that Hillary Clinton sold a share of America’s uranium to Russia in exchange for a massive donation to the Clinton Foundation.

RELATED FACT-CHECK: Exaggerated post connects Clintons, Russia, uranium deal

In 2018, The Hill began labeling Solomon’s articles as opinion. Then, in March and April 2019, Solomon published a series of columns alleging conspiracies involving Democrats and Ukraine.

One of his key sources, apparently, was former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer.

According to the New York Times, Giuliani, whose activities were central to the administration’s efforts to get an investigation launched into Trump’s political rivals, gave Solomon a cache of information on Biden, his son Hunter and special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.

""I really turned my stuff over to John Solomon,"" Giuliani told the New York Times.

When Fiona Hill, Trump’s former top Russia expert, was asked during private testimony how she first learned about Giuliani’s ""interest"" in Ukraine, she mentioned Solomon, whose columns outlined the same conspiracies that Giuliani was actively pushing on Twitter and TV.

Senior State Department official George Kent later testified that what he had described as the ""campaign of slander"" against former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch began with one of Solomon’s articles and ended with Yovanovitch’s removal.

And Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, director for European Affairs at the National Security Council, said he became concerned about Giuliani and the narratives he was pushing in part because of Solomon’s columns. State Department official Catherine Croft said the same.

Solomon’s methods have been further scrutinized since the impeachment inquiry began. In March, he shared an advance copy of a column with Giuliani’s associates, including recently indicted Ukrainian businessman Lev Parnas, who has reportedly helped connect him to sources.

Solomon left The Hill in September for undisclosed reasons, and Fox News soon hired him. He has stood by his work as ""completely accurate and transparent,"" even as one impeachment witness after another has questioned his findings.

Solomon’s allegations on Yovanovitch, Biden

Solomon’s opinion articles on Ukraine have advanced a number of unsupported allegations about Yovanovitch, the Bidens and supposed Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election.

He has had an assist from Fox News host Sean Hannity, Giuliani and Trump, who tweeted about Solomon’s work four times and recently suggested he should win a Pulitzer Prize.

Solomon has appeared on Hannity’s primetime TV show at least 55 times since March 20, according to our search via Nexis. He has been mentioned many more times, as well.

On March 20, Solomon went on Hannity’s show to promote a column he had published that day based on an interview he conducted with Yuriy Lutsenko, then the top prosecutor in Ukraine.

The column quoted Lutsenko falsely claiming that Yovanovitch gave him a list of people he should not prosecute, a charge the State Department denied and Lutsenko has since retracted. The column also claimed Yovanovitch had privately bad-mouthed Trump, citing a letter from former Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican, to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Yovanovitch denied both allegations during her testimony.

But the allegations had already left their mark, having been promoted on Hannity and other Fox News programs, circulated within right-wing media and tweeted out by Trump and his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Yovanovitch was abruptly recalled from her post in May.

“John Solomon: As Russia Collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges.” @seanhannity @FoxNews — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 21, 2019

Other impeachment witnesses have criticized Solomon’s writing on Yovanovitch. Kent testified that Solomon’s article ""was, if not entirely made up in full cloth, it was primarily non-truths and non-sequiturs."" He later said he had ""every reason to believe it was not true.""

Vindman said all the ""key elements were false,"" noting that Solomon’s columns ""smelled really rotten"" before joking, ""His grammar might have been right.""

Similar objections have been raised in testimony about two articles Solomon published about Biden in April, which were also referenced in the whistleblower’s complaint.

Solomon’s April columns asserted that then-Vice President Biden forced Ukraine to fire former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin in order to stop an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a gas company for which Hunter Biden served on the board. Solomon wrote that Biden withheld aid dollars from Ukraine as leverage to get Shokin removed.

There’s no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden, as we’ve noted before. It’s not clear that the long-dormant investigation into Burisma had been reopened, as Solomon claimed, and Western leaders and institutions were united in wanting Shokin removed.

In his closed-door deposition, Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, said he believed Lutsenko — a key but questionable source in many of Solomon’s columns — was ""making things up."" He said Biden ""was representing U.S. policy at the time.""

""The allegations themselves, including those against Ambassador Yovanovitch, did not appear to me to be credible at all,"" Volker said during public testimony Nov. 19. ""I’ve known Vice President Biden for a long time. Those accusations were not credible.""

Solomon’s columns also alleged misconduct in Ukraine by Democratic donor George Soros and claimed, without much evidence, that Democrats coordinated with Ukrainian officials to interfere in the 2016 election by sharing dirt on Trump and reviving a 2014 investigation into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who had ties to the country’s old, pro-Russia regime.

These claims are unproven, and the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that it was Russia — not Ukraine — that interfered in the 2016 election, with the intent of helping Trump."

One important moment to many Republicans was not an answer Taylor or Kent gave. It was a nonanswer.

Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer, who worked for President George W. Bush as White House press secretary, called attention on Twitter to a testy exchange between Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas.

""Rep. Ratcliffe just asked the most important question of the day: Was there anything in President Trump's July 25th phone call that was impeachable,"" Fleischer tweeted. ""Neither witness said yes.""

Rep. Ratcliffe just asked the most important question of the day: Was there anything in President Trump's July 25th phone call that was impeachable. Neither witness said yes. — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) November 13, 2019

Since Fleischer and others — including President Donald Trump — have tweeted about the back-and-forth, we decided to revisit the moment in question, which came toward the end of Ratcliffe’s allotted speaking time, and see what was said.

Taylor said impeachment wasn’t for him to decide

The exchange came after Ratcliffe asked about Trump’s phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, a readout of which was released by the White House in September.

""So, in this impeachment hearing today, where we impeach presidents for treason or bribery or other high crimes, where is the impeachable offense in that call?"" Ratcliffe asked. ""Are either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call?""

After roughly five seconds, Taylor started to respond. But Ratcliffe interrupted and, shouting over Taylor, withdrew the question before Taylor could finish. Taylor became visibly agitated.

Amid the crosstalk, Taylor said, ""I’m not here to take one side or the other, that’s your decision.""

At that point, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., offered to suspend the clock so Taylor could respond to the question without running out the rest of Ratcliffe’s time.

""I would just like to say that I’m not here to do anything having to do with the … to decide about impeachment,"" Taylor said. ""That is not what either of us are here to do. This is your job.""

That’s a different answer than the one suggested in Fleischer’s tweet, which characterized Taylor’s response as being telling in the same way that an affirmative ""no"" might have been. In reality, Taylor opted to pass on the question, saying it wasn’t his role to give a straight answer.

The job belongs to Congress, he said. Kent never addressed the question himself.

In an email to PolitiFact, Fleischer said both Taylor and Kent were ""direct and to the point"" in response to other questions and that ""their failure to answer in the affirmative spoke volumes.""

""They were not shy about providing their judgment for other questions, yet they notably did not say yes on Ratcliffe’s question,"" Fleischer told us. ""They easily could have leaned in to answer the obvious question about impeachment. They did not say yes.""

An attorney for Taylor did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

That comfort seems to be extending to the network’s live coverage of public hearings related to the House impeachment inquiry into Trump’s actions on Ukraine.

During the Nov. 13 testimony of Ambassador William Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, and senior State Department official George Kent, Fox News showed graphics that amplified unsubstantiated attacks Trump has pushed against Taylor and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

To be clear, Fox News also aired graphics presenting the same biographical information about Taylor, Schiff and others found on other TV news networks.

But the visuals featuring Trump-friendly claims had social media users buzzing. So we decided to put the false and misleading claims in context.

""Schiff publicly exaggerated substance of Trump-Zelensky call""

A screenshot of Fox News' coverage of the Nov. 13 hearing.

This claim is in reference to the way Schiff described the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

During a Sept. 26 congressional hearing, Schiff gave his interpretation of what Trump said on the call, which he said ""reads like a classic organized crime shakedown."" He was not reading word-for-word from the readout of the call, but Republicans said he made it seem like he was.

When Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, pointed out that what Schiff said did not match the readout of the call, Schiff said his summary was ""meant to be at least part in parody.""

We noted that Schiff explicitly introduced his remarks as ""the essence of what the president communicates"" and described them as ""in sum and character, what the president was trying to communicate."" He said he was presenting Trump’s message ""shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words,"" and he never pretended to offer Trump’s exacts words.

We also compared Schiff’s dramatized version to the White House readout of the call. We found that his summary was mostly accurate with a few exaggerations.

""Schiff admitted to not being clear about contact w/ whistleblower""

Schiff did learn the outlines of the whistleblower’s complaint days before it was submitted to the intelligence community inspector general, despite what he said several times in September.

But there’s no evidence that Schiff personally had contact with the whistleblower, nor is there evidence that he helped write the complaint that spurred the launch of the impeachment inquiry.

Seeking guidance, the whistleblower turned to a House Intelligence Committee aide, who advised the whistleblower to get a lawyer and file a complaint through the formal channels, per the committee procedures. The aide shared some of that information with Schiff.

When this information came out, we rated Schiff’s September claim that ""we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower"" False. His spokesperson told us his statement should have been more carefully phrased, and Schiff later said he should have been more clear.

""Trump has repeatedly implied that Schiff has committed treason""

A screenshot of Fox News' coverage of the Nov. 13 hearing.

Trump has repeatedly accused Schiff of treason for his retelling of Trump’s June 25 call with Zelensky. But experts and the Constitution say Schiff’s actions don’t constitute treason.

As we’ve noted, treason is defined narrowly in the Constitution to keep it from being applied to mere differences of opinion. The Constitution defines it this way:

""Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.""

Because the definition is so narrow, charges have only been brought a few dozen times in the country’s history. Experts agreed that nothing Schiff has said or done constitutes treason.

Trump’s accusation blurs the distinction between loyalty to a president and loyalty to the United States, said Carlton Larson, a law professor at the University of California-Davis and author of a book on treason. Even if Schiff had made up Trump’s words, it wouldn’t count as treason.

""President Trump dismissed Taylor as a ‘Never Trumper’""

A screenshot of Fox News' coverage of the Nov. 13 hearing.

Trump has called Taylor, a career diplomat and military veteran, a ""Never Trumper,"" including on Twitter the morning of Taylor’s testimony.

There’s no evidence that Taylor would qualify as a Never Trumper under any reasonable definition for the term, and leading Never Trumpers told us they had never heard of him associating with the movement. We rated Trump’s statement False.

Taylor is currently the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, a role known as the chargé d’affaires that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked him to fill. He has worked in every administration since 1985, including most recently as ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009.

The accusation came after Harf, who worked for former Secretary of State John Kerry, said Hilton had ""no evidence"" to back a series of unsubstantiated claims he made about Ukraine.

So, ummm, WOW!



Fox News host Steve Hilton straight-up accuses his Fox News colleague Marie Harf of ""covering up the corruption"" of the Bidens in Ukraine because she worked at the State Dept during the Obama years.



""Are you kidding me?!?!"" Harf yells at one point. pic.twitter.com/9767n2mSOr — Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) November 4, 2019

The fiery back-and-forth stole the headlines, but we were more interested in two of the claims that prompted Harf’s challenge in the first place.

Defending President Donald Trump against impeachment, Hilton said investigations should be launched into the last administration, starting with former Vice President Joe Biden.

""He supervised billions of dollars of aid that went from the U.S. taxpayer to Ukraine,"" Hilton said of Biden. ""Much of that went to Burisma, a gas company that was paying his son.""

Turning to Kerry, Hilton said the former secretary of state also had connections at Burisma.

""They hired John Kerry’s former chief of staff, while he was secretary of state, paid him money from Burisma, could’ve come from the U.S. taxpayer,"" he said. ""That money is circled back to Democratic senators, who then write to the administration for even more money to be sent to Burisma. All of that needs to be investigated.""

In a statement to PolitiFact, Fox News pointed to four TV segments where Hilton explained his theories at length. But we found no proof that Biden directed any aid earmarked for Ukraine to Burisma. And while the gas company did hire lobbyist David Leiter, Kerry’s former Senate chief of staff, there’s no evidence that any money was channeled in the way Hilton claimed.

There’s no proof that U.S. aid money went to Burisma

Hilton’s first claim — that U.S. aid dollars sent to Ukraine under Biden’s supervision went toward Burisma, where Biden’s son Hunter was a board member — is unsubstantiated, experts told us.

""It’s indisputable that aid went to Ukraine's energy sector,"" Fox News said in its statement. ""No one knows how much, if any, Burisma specifically got as that has not been reported. It’s about investigating possible corruption and exposing it.""

Trump and his allies have charged, without evidence, that Biden forced Ukraine to remove its lead prosecutor in order to protect his son from a then-dormant investigation into Burisma. The idea that Biden actively funnelled money to Burisma is also baseless, experts said.

""I can see no way that USAID money has gone to Burisma,"" said Anders Åslund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.

""I am not aware of Burisma receiving any U.S. funds,"" added Yoshiko Herrera, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who previously headed the university’s center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia.

Ukraine has been a leading recipient of foreign aid since Russia’s 2014 invasion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Data from the United States Agency for International Development indicates that the United States disbursed about $1.28 billion to Ukraine between 2014 and 2016, with roughly $53 million going to its energy department.

The United States also sent separate $1 billion loan guarantees in 2014, 2015 and 2016. And a 2014 law authorized $50 million to be sent between 2016 and 2018.

But the context is critical. After Russia invaded in 2014, the international community stepped in to bolster the new western-leaning government.

Money directed to Ukraine’s energy sector was to help Ukraine scale back its dependence on Russia for energy sources by making it more energy efficient, according to the Congressional Research Service, which noted that the United States provided ""technical assistance.""

To that end, the 2014 law authorizing additional funds took specific steps toward ""helping Ukraine reduce its dependence on natural gas imported from the Russian Federation.""

A November 2014 White House fact sheet said the United States was working with international donors to help Ukraine boost energy efficiency and supporting Ukraine’s efforts to enhance energy production and restructure its state-owned gas company, Naftogaz, among other things.

There’s no evidence that any of this aid or support went directly to Burisma, nor is there evidence that Joe Biden worked to guide it there.

""All this money went to the Ukrainian government,"" Åslund said. ""None of it went to Burisma.""

There’s no proof of wrongdoing by Kerry or Democratic senators

Hilton’s second claim — that a Kerry associate paid off Democratic senators to orchestrate the transfer of money to Burisma — is also unsubstantiated.

What’s true is that David Leiter, a lobbyist hired in 2014 by Burisma, served as Kerry’s chief of staff for seven years while Kerry was a senator for Massachusetts. Kerry spokesman Matt Summers said Leiter left the office in 1997, 16 years before Kerry became secretary of state.

But the rest of Hilton’s claim, which alleges a sequence of money transfers and bribes meant to line Hunter Biden’s pockets, is an unsupported take on a series of unrelated events.

In short, Hilton’s claim is that taxpayer money flowed from the United States to Burisma, from Burisma to Leiter, and finally from Leiter to Democratic Sens. Ed Markey and Jeanne Shaheen, who then pushed President Barack Obama to send more money Ukraine’s way.

The conspiracy hinges on the fact that Leiter was hired by Burisma in 2014, while he was working as a registered lobbyist at a firm called ML Strategies. Lobbying disclosure forms show that ML Strategies took in $90,000 for Leiter’s work with the Ukrainian company.

Hilton has alleged that Leiter used this money to pay off Markey, Shaheen and others, who sent a letter to Obama on June 27, 2014, urging his administration to ""leverage the full resources and expertise of the US government to assist Ukraine in improving its energy efficiency"" for the sake of ""eliminating its dependence on natural gas imports from Russia.""

In a statement to PolitiFact, Shaheen’s office pointed out that two weeks before the letter was sent, Russia had cut off all gas exports to Ukraine, a detail the senators noted in their letter.

But the biggest problem with Hilton’s timeline is that the bulk of Leiter’s donations to the Democratic senators who penned the letter came before he was hired at Burisma.

According to Time, Leiter signed on to lobby for Burisma on May 20, 2014. He sent multiple donations to both Markey and Shaheen, but not one coincided with his stint lobbying for Burisma.

For what it’s worth, Shaheen’s office also noted that the senators’ goal — as expressed in the letter — was to reduce Ukraine’s gas consumption and make the country more energy efficient, which would have been at odds with Burisma’s ability to maximize profits."

Experts say there’s no clear link,"In the weeks since the attacks in Texas and Ohio, politicians and pundits have pointed the blame for mass shootings in several different directions.

Some called out current gun laws. Some faulted white supremacy or President Donald Trump’s rhetoric on immigrants. Others blamed video games or prescription drugs.

Fox News talk show host Tucker Carlson has a new hypothesis to explain why people to commit acts of extreme violence: marijuana.

During an Aug. 27 interview with former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, Carlson noted that the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had cocaine, Xanax and alcohol in his system when he attacked.

""He was also known to be a long-time user of marijuana,"" Carlson said. ""It turns out, in fact, that many violent individuals have been avid marijuana users. Is there a connection?""

Berenson replied that that marijuana and violence are indeed linked, because cannabis can cause the onset of psychosis, which can in turn lead to violence. That’s the finding at the heart of his new book, ""Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence.""

""So, I don't think it's going way out on a limb to draw the connection then between cannabis use, particularly I assume chronic use, and acts of violence,"" Carlson responded. ""Why is this not something that we're pursuing more aggressively?""

In the past, we’ve debunked claims that mass shootings could be fueled by psychiatric drugs or Ritalin, a prescription for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. We also rated a 2014 claim that people on pot ""shoot each other ... stab each other ... strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families"" as Mostly False.

From talking to experts, we found that Berenson’s book goes far beyond what the available science actually shows. Carlson offered no pushback as he praised Berenson for being ""a voice in the wilderness,"" giving viewers the wrong impression about a cannabis link to violence.

The reality is that there’s no scientific consensus.

Berenson’s findings are disputed

In a statement to PolitiFact, a Fox News spokesperson said Carlson’s segment was inspired by a New York Post op-ed that said an anti-pot lobby group had compiled a list of mass shooters it claimed were avid marijuana users, including Dayton shooter Connor Betts, Aurora, Colo., shooter James Holmes, Tucson, Ariz., shooter Jared Loughner and Chattanooga, Tenn., shooter Mohammad Abdulazeez.

The spokesperson also pointed to a July study from British and Dutch researchers that found daily use of marijuana — compared with nondaily use or no use — increased the likelihood of violence for people with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.

But that doesn’t mean casual pot smokers will necessarily turn violent.

""This is absolute nonsense,"" said Katherine Newman, interim chancellor at the University of Massachusetts, Boston and the author of a book on school shootings. ""There is no link whatsoever between marijuana and extreme violence.""

Other experts told us there simply isn’t enough of a scientific consensus to draw Berenson’s conclusions.

The central premise of Berenson’s book — which argues against cannabis legalization — is summed up in these three lines: ""Marijuana causes psychosis. Psychosis causes violence. The obvious implication is that marijuana causes violence.""

But the book has been a source of controversy since it was published in January. A public letter signed by 100 scholars and clinicians refuted some of its central findings and accused Berenson of cherry-picking data and presenting correlation as causation.

Correlation vs. causation

Berenson relied primarily on two studies to connect pot and psychosis, including one 1987 study from a researcher who told Berenson that ""cannabis is responsible for between 10% and 15% of schizophrenia cases."" (This specific finding came not from the study itself, but from Berenson's interview with its author.)

The other is a 2017 study from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine that found ""cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses."" But it was not as definitive as Berenson made it out to be.

UCLA's Ziva Cooper, one of the study’s board members, disputed Berenson’s characterization of its findings, writing on Twitter that it ""did not conclude that cannabis causes schizophrenia"" but rather found an association between the two.

On the connection between marijuana and violence, Berenson pointed to anecdotes and data showing that the first four states to legalize pot — Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington — saw increases in murders and aggravated assaults after 2014.

But critics said he cherry-picked that data, since Washington and Colorado legalized marijuana in 2012, not 2014, and there was a national uptick in homicides in 2015.

Benjamin Hansen, professor of economics at Oregon University, built a model to estimate what the murder rates in Colorado and Washington would have looked like had pot not become legal.

""The homicide rates in Colorado and Washington were actually below what the data predicted they would have been given the trends in homicides from 2000-2012,"" he wrote in a blog post.

In fact, other data could tell a much different story.

""Cannabis consumption, and especially heavy cannabis consumption, has been on the rise since 1992,"" Mark Kleiman, a professor of public policy at New York University Wagner, told New York Magazine. ""Over that period, national homicide rates have fallen more than 50%.""

Plus, for every study that’s declared a link between pot and violence, there are others that say the opposite. A 2013 Rand Corporation study commissioned by the federal government found that ""marijuana use does not induce violent crime, and the links between marijuana use and property crime are thin.""

As we noted in 2014, there is bound to be some overlap between people who commit violent acts and people who smoke marijuana because of how popular marijuana is. According to the United Nations, 192 million people worldwide used marijuana at least once in 2016.

While marijuana does have some health consequences, a turn toward violence is not widely accepted as one of them.

A lack of consensus

Behavioral sciences and drug policy experts told us it’s widely accepted that marijuana and psychosis are linked.

But there’s disagreement over which comes first — the marijuana use or the psychosis — and whether one causes the other.

People with psychotic illnesses are more likely to use pot, but that could be because they tend to turn to it in an effort to self-medicate, said Hansen, the Oregon University economist.

Even if causality could be assigned, it’s also not clear from the available studies whether the drug unmasks psychotic symptoms in predisposed people or whether it triggers the onset of psychosis entirely, said James Knoll, director of forensic psychiatry at Syracuse University.

The bottom line is that, without being able to legally administer marijuana in a controlled laboratory setting, researchers can’t tell whether its use causes psychosis.

""In terms of whether using cannabis causes the development of psychotic disorders, there is no consensus,"" said Matthew Johnson, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University. ""The definitive studies have yet to be run.""

For the same reasons, experts are skeptical about the supposed connection between marijuana and violence.

""Marijuana use is higher in young men, people with serious adverse childhood experiences, antisocial personality, low income, low education, use of other illicit substances,"" Knoll said. ""All of these are well known risk factors for violence in their own right.""

So yes, many mass shooters have proven to be marijuana users, experts said. But that doesn’t mean pot made them pull the trigger.

""Cannabis use is common overall, but it is most concentrated in groups with high rates of violence,"" said Jonathan Caulkins, professor of operations research and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. ""So absolutely many people who commit violent acts have been heavy cannabis users. The only argument is whether the association is causal.""

If anything, marijuana’s popularity should make a supposed connection to violence easier to spot, Knoll said. ""If there was a clear or strong link, one would expect it to be more pronounced than we are finding.""

Clarification, Sept. 5, 2019: This report has been updated to reflect that information about the connection between marijuana and psychosis came from Berenson's interview with the author of the 1987 study, not the study itself."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/aug/07/tucker-carlson-says-white-supremacy-hoax-here-are-/,2019-08-07T00:00:00,Tucker Carlson says white supremacy is a hoax. Here are 5 reasons why that’s wrong,"Fox News personality Tucker Carlson claimed white supremacy is a hoax and ""not a real problem in America."" But that’s not what the evidence shows.

Speaking on his Aug. 6 show, which reaches around 3 million viewers nightly, Carlson said:

""The combined membership of every white supremacist organization in this country would be able to fit inside a college football stadium. I mean, seriously. This is a country where the average person is getting poorer while the suicide rate is spiking. White supremacy, that's the problem. This is a hoax. Just like the Russia hoax, it's a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep a hold on power. It's exactly what's going on.""

As a social ill, white supremacy is difficult to quantify — despite Carlson’s suggestion that a headcount is easily obtainable.

But the available data suggests a more pressing story than Carlson's take. While the FBI doesn’t code incidents as being committed by white nationalists, officials reported a 17 percent increase in hate crimes in 2017 over the previous year, and more than half were motivated by biases based on race, ethnicity or ancestry.

David Sterman, a policy analyst who studies violent extremism at the left-leaning think tank New America, said Carlson’s argument amounted to willful denialism.

""The United States has a long history of white supremacist violence,"" Sterman said. ""The claim that it is a hoax is absurd.""

Here are five points that refute Carlson’s claim. (Fox News did not respond to a request for comment.)

White supremacists killed more people than any other domestic extremist group from 2000-16

An unclassified May 2017 intelligence bulletin, jointly authored by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, found that white supremacist extremists killed more people than any other domestic extremist movement from 2000 to 2016. (The domestic terror classification excludes the Sept. 11 attacks by jihadists.)

The agencies warned that white supremacist extremists ""likely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year,"" and cautioned that the ""often spontaneous and opportunistic nature"" of this type of violence makes it particularly hard for law enforcement to prevent.

Yet the intelligence memo also revealed that law enforcement had managed to foil a mass-casualty plot in which a juvenile suspect, whose phone contained Nazi imagery and language advocating the slaughter of Jews and African Americans, planned a shooting at an Ohio high school.

The Anti-Defamation League reached findings that paralleled the federal agencies’. As a share of all killings committed by right-wing extremists in the United States over the last decade, 76 percent were committed by white supremacists, the Anti-Defamation League told PolitiFact. Last year, 39 of 50 domestic extremist killings were committed by white supremacists, the ADL’s head Jonathan Greenblatt wrote on Twitter in response to Carlson’s claim.

.@TuckerCarlson, *white supremacy is no hoax.*



39/50 domestic extremist killings in 2018 were committed by white supremacists: https://t.co/9eDBdLxxfm (1/6) https://t.co/gdHaWf7QA9 — Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) August 7, 2019

FBI director: White supremacy a ‘persistent, pervasive threat’

Carlson’s claim is at odds with the view of top law enforcement. At a hearing before a congressional panel in April, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked what danger white supremacy poses to the country.

""The danger, I think, of white supremacists, violent extremism or any other kind of violent extremism, is significant,"" Wray told the House Appropriations Subcommittee. ""We assess that it’s a persistent, pervasive threat.""

In July, following Wray’s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the FBI said a majority of arrests related to racially motivated domestic terrorism over the previous nine months were believed to be inspired by white supremacy.

A substantial number of Americans sympathize with neo-Nazis and white supremacists

Carlson said you could fit white supremacists in a college football stadium. We reached out to Fox News and didn’t hear back, and we didn’t find a solid calculation of how many people this would include.

Experts told us to look at polls to get an idea of how prevalent white supremacy is in the United States.

After the deadly 2017 clashes in Charlottesville, Va., one poll asked Americans: Do you think it’s acceptable or unacceptable to hold neo-Nazi or white supremacist views? According to the ABC-Washington Post poll, 9% percent said such views are acceptable.

As the country has seen a rise in hate crimes among most groups, American attitudes about the state of race relations have soured, according to a trove of opinion polling cited by Brian Levin, who directs the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism.

""Recent social surveys mirror these findings, showing an increase in social distancing and fear,"" as well as reduced tolerance for people belonging to other groups, Levin wrote in the center’s annual report.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization that has tracked hate groups since the 1980s, says that the number of white nationalist groups grew from 100 to 148 in 2018. Many of the groups on the list are various state chapters of the same umbrella organization. (For example, The Right Stuff is listed dozens of times.)

Rise in white extremist terrorist attacks in North America, Europe and Australia

White extremist terror attacks have been on the rise in recent years. This finding comes from an investigation the New York Times published in April that drew from the Global Terrorism Database and coded attacks carried out from 2011-17 by ideological motive.

The newspaper defined ""white extremist"" as including white nationalist, white supremacist, neo-Nazi, xenophobic, anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic ideologies. As the chart below shows, the paper identified a surge in the number of white extremist terror attacks in 2015, largely owing to attacks on migrants residing in Europe, with a dropoff in attacks the next year followed by an uptick in 2017:

Source: The New York Times.

Technology is extending white extremist terrorists’ reach

With today’s social media platforms, it is easier for white supremacists to share their views.

""We know the rise in violent white supremacy is partly fueled by their use of social media platforms that connect like-minded individuals who are geographically isolated to share hate-filled, violent material,"" said Elizabeth Neumann, an assistant Homeland Security secretary, in recent written testimony for a House committee hearing.

For example, the shooter who killed 50 people in an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, drew inspiration from far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 in Norway in 2011, as well as other perpetrators.

Authorities are investigating an online post uploaded before the Aug. 3 shooting in El Paso. The opening line reads: ""In general, I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto."""

""In the past 48hrs, the USA horrifically lost 34 people to mass shootings,"" Tyson wrote in an Aug. 4 tweet. ""On average, across any 48hrs, we also lose … 500 to Medical errors, 300 to the Flu, 250 to Suicide, 200 to Car Accidents, 40 to Homicide via Handgun.""

Often our emotions respond more to spectacle than to data. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) August 4, 2019

""Often our emotions respond more to spectacle than to data,"" he added.

Tyson’s tweet amassed tens of thousands of retweets and likes, but the reactions were largely negative, with many social media users criticizing the post as tone-deaf and highlighting differences between mass shootings and the other causes of death Tyson cited.

""The flu doesn’t target people based on their race,"" said one popular reply.

""No one person caused 500 medical errors,"" said another.

In the face of such heavy backlash, Tyson apologized for his tweet on Facebook. But he still maintained that his numbers were correct.

Without weighing in on the appropriateness of Tyson’s tweet, we decided to check his statistics. Our finding: The numbers are generally in the right ballpark.

Tyson did not respond to a request for comment submitted through his website.

Claim: 500 Americans die from medical errors every 48 hours.

This claim is difficult to verify because death certificates don’t leave room for hospitals to admit to medical errors, which could include problems with medical diagnosis, record-keeping, drug administration, surgery or blood transfer.

But Tyson’s number matches what some studies have said.

A 1999 report from the U.S. Institute of Medicine estimated that, on average, about 98,000 people die each year from medical errors in United States hospitals. Taking that 20-year-old estimate at face value would mean that, on average, about 268 people die from medical errors every day and about 537 people die every 48 hours.

More recent reports have suggested that casualties due to medical error might be even higher.

In a 2016 study, researchers at Johns Hopkins University made estimates based on medical death-rate and hospitalization data from 2000 to 2008 and attributed 250,000 deaths per year to medical errors.

Another 2013 study from the Journal for Patient Safety estimated that more than 400,000 patients per year die in hospitals as a result of ""preventable harm.""

These findings would put medical error behind just heart disease and cancer as the third-leading cause of death in the United States.

However, some researchers have called into question the findings of the Johns Hopkins study, arguing among other things that it’s hard to believe such a high proportion of in-hospital deaths are the result of medical errors.

Claim: 300 Americans die from the flu every 48 hours

This claim would be more precise if it said 300 people died from ""influenza and pneumonia,"" rather than simply the flu.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 55,672 Americans died from ""influenza and pneumonia"" in 2017. That’s about 153 per day and 305 per 48 hours, on average.

The flu is a highly contagious viral infection, and pneumonia is an infection or inflammation of the lungs. The two diseases are different but related, with the flu being a common cause of pneumonia, according to the American Lung Association.

The CDC’s numbers for 2017 are the best data available based on information reported on death certificates.

Other estimates the agency has made using mathematical models have suggested that the flu was associated with an even greater number of deaths in more recent time periods.

Claim: 250 Americans die by suicide every 48 hours

This claim is accurate.

According to the CDC, there were 47,173 suicides recorded in the United States in 2017. That means there were about 129 suicides per day, on average, or about 258 per 48 hours.

Claim: 200 Americans die from car accidents every 48 hours

This claim is in line with the latest available data from the CDC and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

In 2017, there were 37,133 fatalities caused by motor vehicle accidents in the United States, according to the NHTSA. On average, that amounts to about 102 per day, or about 203 every 48 hours.

Meanwhile, the CDC counted 38,659 deaths from motor vehicles in 2017, or about 106 per day and 212 every 48 hours, on average.

Claim: 40 Americans are killed in homicides by handgun every 48 hours

This claim matches up with numbers from the FBI.

Data for murder victims from the FBI indicates that there were 7,032 homicides involving handguns in the United States in 2017, which translates to an average of about 19 deaths per day and 39 per 48 hours. That’s more than the number of homicides by rifles and shotguns.

All together, the FBI recorded 10,982 murders involving some type of firearm in 2017, which lines up to about 30 on average every day and 60 on average every 48 hours.

The CDC’s tally for firearm homicides — based on what’s reported in death certificates — is even higher. The agency said there were 14,542 in 2017."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/jul/26/could-trump-be-indicted-after-leaving-office-muell/,2019-07-26T00:00:00,"Could Trump (or any president) be indicted after leaving office? Mueller, legal experts say yes","Could President Donald Trump face criminal charges after he leaves office? Former special counsel Robert Mueller’s testimony before Congress had pundits trying to answer that question.

On the July 25 episode of ""Fox & Friends,"" host Ainsley Earhardt said news reports that said Trump could be indicted after leaving office were ""not factually correct"" because they didn’t take into account a correction Mueller made to his testimony.

""He corrected himself and he said something about, ‘we couldn’t come up with a determination,’ which means that they couldn’t find a crime,"" Earhardt said. ""But if you watched ABC, if you watched CBS, if you watched NBC, ABC said that Trump could still face criminal charges after he leaves office. That’s not necessarily true.""

However, ""true"" is the exact word Mueller used when asked if Trump could be charged after his presidency, and the former special counsel’s correction was about something totally different.

""A president can be indicted when he leaves office, I know that,"" Earhardt said on air the next day. ""I was questioning whether this president will be indicted based on the Mueller report.""

Since the topic involves speculation about future legal issues, we decided not to rate Earhardt’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. But there’s clearly some confusion over whether Trump could be prosecuted once his time in the White House ends, so we wanted to step in with the facts.

The bottom line: Mueller testified twice that a president could be indicted after leaving office, and the four legal experts we spoke to all agreed.

What Mueller said about charges after office

Throughout his testimony, Mueller made it clear that Trump the president could not be indicted. But Trump the citizen, like all ex-presidents, is a different story.

Here’s Mueller’s first exchange on the matter, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.:

Nadler: ""Under Department of Justice policy, the president could be prosecuted for obstruction of justice crimes after he leaves office, correct?""

Mueller: ""True.""

Here’s the second exchange, with Rep. Ken Buck, R-Co.:

Buck: ""Okay, but could you charge the president with a crime after he left office?""

Mueller: ""Yes.""

Buck: ""You believe that he committed — you could charge the president of the United States with obstruction of justice after he left office?""

Mueller: ""Yes.""

Buck: ""Ethically, under the ethical standards?""

Mueller: ""I'm not certain because I haven't looked at the ethical standards, but the OLC opinion says that the prosecutor, while he cannot bring a charge against a sitting president, nonetheless he can continue the investigation to see if there are any other persons who might be drawn into the conspiracy.""

Notably, while Mueller said Trump could face charges after he leaves office, he did not say that the president should face charges.

Legal experts we spoke to agreed with Mueller.

""Once a president is out of office, the primary reasons to avoid prosecution — deference to impeachment and the need to avoid distraction of the chief executive from his or her important duties — both evaporate,"" said Mark Osler, professor of law at the University of St. Thomas.

Arguments based on the president’s ""supposed position at the top of the prosecutorial hierarchy"" also lose force for ex-presidents, said Cornell University law professor Josh Chafetz.

Diane Marie Amann, professor of law at the University of Georgia, pointed out that even the Justice Department ruling that says a sitting president cannot be indicted includes a line specifying that the prohibition fades when he or she leaves office.

""The constitutional structure permits a sitting president to be subject to criminal process only after he leaves office or is removed therefrom through the impeachment process,"" it says.

What Mueller corrected

Earhardt and others — including Trump himself — confused Mueller’s remarks about Trump being charged after his presidency with other comments Mueller later corrected.

But Mueller made one correction to his testimony, and it had nothing to do with whether Trump could be charged once he’s out of the White House.

The correction addressed Mueller’s response to a question from Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., when the former special counsel seemed to suggest Trump would have been indicted were it not for the Justice Department’s ruling that says a sitting president cannot be indicted.

Here’s the exchange between Lieu and Mueller:

Lieu: ""The reason, again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of (Office of Legal Counsel) opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?""

Mueller: ""That is correct.""

On its face, Mueller’s answer implied that the OLC ruling was the only reason Trump was not indicted. But that’s not what his team has said in the report or in public statements.

Later, Mueller clarified his response. He said:

""I want to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. Lieu, who said, and I quote, ‘You didn't charge the president because of the OLC opinion.’

That is not the correct way to say it. As we say in the report and as I said in the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime."""

Carlson fired back that night. ""Ilhan Omar and her allies in Congress immediately demanded that this show be pulled off the air,"" he said on his show. ""They didn’t rebut what we said, any of our points, or even acknowledge them. They just tried to silence us.""

Left-leaning activist groups such as Media Matters for America have made a habit of pressuring companies to pull advertisements from Fox News’ popular opinion programs. But the TV network continues to outperform competitors CNN and MSNBC in terms of ratings.

Advertiser boycotts against cable news networks have become a feature of the political messaging war. But when it comes to the goals of their organizers, the results have been mixed.

What’s an advertiser boycott?

Advertiser boycotts are public-pressure campaigns meant to squeeze companies into yanking their ads from a particular TV show. Either the advertisers are boycotting the show or people are boycotting the advertisers, but the ultimate target is the show and its host network.

Media Matters, a nonprofit research group that says it combats ""conservative misinformation"" in the U.S. media, has led several such campaigns against Fox News.

The group’s president, Angelo Carusone, said his goal is not to drive Fox News out of business, but to change the network’s behavior and hold its hosts accountable for what they say.

""You cause enough financial harm that they, because they’re a business, would wisely say, ‘Wait a minute, this is costing us money and we need to course correct,’"" he said.

Carusone said Media Matters has targeted Fox News, including Carlson’s show, not because of individual comments made by the network's personnel, but because it believes the network is ""outwardly promoting and profiting off white nationalism, bigotry, extremism, and the business model is to cater exclusively to the far-right.""

""My critique is not that I don’t like the one thing that they did, but rather that I think there’s something fundamentally dangerous about their model itself,"" he said.

He said he wants to see Fox News change those habits and regularly hold talent accountable for controversial comments — as it did when it suspended host Jeanine Pirro in March.

Targeting Fox News

The latest boycotts fueled by Media Matters have targeted Carlson, Pirro and fellow Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity.

Most recently, Media Matters released two batches of audio clips in March of offensive remarks Carlson made as a guest caller on a Tampa-based radio show between 2006 and 2011.

The comments teed off the second advertiser boycott of Carlson’s show — which focuses on challenging Democratic talking points and political correctness — in less than a year.

Previously, at least 25 advertisers left the show in December 2018 after Carlson said immigrants make the United States ""poorer and dirtier and more divided,"" according to Axios.

An ongoing tally kept by Media Matters counts 39 advertisers that have dropped Carlson’s show, plus two more that dropped before returning.

Pirro saw a similar slide after she criticized Omar for wearing a hijab in March, and she was temporarily suspended before returning to her show.

Advertisers also left Ingraham’s show after she made fun of Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg in March 2018 for getting rejected by a handful of colleges.

Hogg tweeted out a list of her advertisers and urged a boycott. He renewed his call in June 2018 when Ingraham compared migrant detention centers with ""summer camps.""

Media Matters claimed Ingraham’s show averaged about 37 ads before Hogg’s first tweet and about 18 in the days after. Politico recorded a similar impact. But Ingraham is still on the air.

So is Hannity, who lost some advertisers at the hands of a Media Matters campaign in 2017. Before that, hosts Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck lost their jobs while facing similar boycotts.

Is there a financial impact?

Still, the advertiser boycotts don’t seem to have significantly affected Fox News, which makes more money from cable subscribers than ad sales and continues to dominate the TV ratings.

The network’s net advertising revenue has increased each of the last several years — and is projected to continue climbing — according to estimates from S&P Global Market Intelligence that Fox News shared with PolitiFact.

""Fox News just reached an all-time record in advertising revenue in the latest fiscal year, which ended on June 30,"" the network said in a statement. ""Our entire lineup continues to have our full support, and we have seen zero impact on our business.""

Carusone said Fox News’ loss of advertisers would have hurt revenues and let other companies negotiate to lower rates for airtime.

However, the bulk of ads are sold months before airing, so companies with pre-purchased ads might have moved their ads to other time slots instead of removing them entirely.

That still could have cost Fox News some money, since the network would likely have had to compensate companies that moved ads from shows with big audiences to shows with small audiences by offering extra commercial time.

But in the long run, experts said advertiser boycotts tend to cause little financial harm and are much better at raising awareness about issues.

""They rarely affect the bottom line of the company being boycotted,"" said Lawrence Glickman, professor of history at Cornell University and an expert in consumer activism.

""If a program is reaching its audience, advertising money will find it,"" added Brian Sheehan, professor of advertising at Syracuse University.

It’s even possible that the conduct that’s inspired advertiser boycotts against Fox News could be helping its ratings. Neeru Paharia, professor of business at Georgetown University, said that for many companies, taking extreme political positions can actually increase audience size.

""Fox News may lose some people, but they also gain a lot of people who really like their message,"" she said. ""Their whole identity is based on being polarizing.""

Plus, the public ""tends to be quick to outrage but also quick to forget,"" said Chris Allieri, founder of the New York communications firm Mulberry & Astor.

Conservatives do it, too

A few conservative activist groups have made similar pushes for boycotts against personalities on MSNBC and CNN. (MSNBC and CNN did not respond to requests for comment.)

In 2013, a group led by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro targeted Ritz Crackers for advertising during an MSNBC show hosted by the Rev. Al Sharpton.

More recently, the Media Equality Project, a project of the conservative website Media Equalizer, has run campaigns to drum up support for Hannity and other Fox News hosts trying to fend off advertiser boycotts against them.

""We normally intervene when there is an active effort by liberal organizations to remove talk hosts from the airwaves,"" said project co-founder Brian Maloney.

In 2017, however, the project tried to counteract Media Matters’ efforts and ""fight fire with fire"" by targeting MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, CNN’s Don Lemon and others with an advertiser boycott campaign called ""Stop the Scalpings."" Hannity even had Maloney on his show to talk about it.

Another right-leaning website, the Media Research Center, tried to get ads off ABC’s ""The View"" after co-host Joy Behar called Vice President Mike Pence’s Christian faith a ""mental illness,"" a comment for which she later apologized. (ABC is a broadcast channel.)

Why they’re happening now

Advertiser boycotts are not new, experts said.

They hit fictional TV shows first. Some Christian groups, for example, led boycotts in the 1990s against advertisers of shows that were considered too LGBTQ-friendly or, in the case of ABC’s ""Nothing Sacred,"" unflattering toward Christianity.

Sheehan said calls for advertisers to disassociate from cable TV shows have increased recently because cable news has become more politically fragmented over the last 30 years.

""Brands taking sides publicly, and demonstrating their political values (liberal or conservative) is increasingly unavoidable,"" he said, pointing to conservative radio host Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who lost advertisers in 2000 over protests from LGBTQ advocacy groups, as an early example.

Social media has further elevated activists’ ability to directly influence advertisers.

But that cuts two ways. Allieri said that while advertiser boycotts have seemed big, they ""have been largely limited to smaller factions of people who are loud on social."" A lot of people sit out.

""At the end of the day, folks might just want to retreat from all of the bad and contentious news entirely and flee to Netflix or HBO and catch up on ‘Big Little Lies,’"" he said."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/jul/11/fox-news-guest-says-if-trumps-hotel-revenues-are-e/,2019-07-11T00:00:00,"Fox News guest says if Trump's hotel revenues are ‘emoluments,’ so was Obama's Nobel. Not exactly","An old word — ""emoluments"" — is finding new life in the news, as a federal appeals court on July 10 dismissed one of three major lawsuits on the issue against President Donald Trump.

The lawsuits have alleged that Trump has violated an anti-corruption provision in the Constitution by accepting emoluments from foreign government officials.

The appeals court’s decision came just two days after the Justice Department asked another appeals court to halt a similar lawsuit by congressional Democrats.

But even before that news hit the headlines, TV pundits were debating whether Trump’s hotels could be putting him in violation of the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause. On the July 7 episode of Fox News’ ""Life, Liberty and Levin,"" conservative host Mark Levin broached the subject, calling emoluments ""one of the most boring issues in America.""

Levin noted how some people say Trump is illegally accepting emoluments by letting foreign diplomats pay to stay and eat at his luxury hotel in Washington. Levin asked his guest, lawyer John Eastman, if these revenues should be considered ""an unconstitutional benefit.""

""If that were the case, then President Obama accepting the Nobel Peace Prize would have been an unconstitutional emolument,"" said Eastman, professor of law at Chapman University. ""Any president that owned stock in any foreign corporation that had ties to a foreign government, when that stock price goes up because of some action of the foreign government, that would be an unconstitutional emolument.""

Really? We thought Eastman’s comparison seemed like a stretch, so we decided to look into what exactly qualifies as an illegal foreign emolument.

Specifically, would Obama’s one-time Nobel Peace Prize actually count the same as Trump’s vast web of hotels, golf clubs and other businesses?

We decided against rating Eastman’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter, since the courts haven’t made a final ruling on the lawsuit brought by Democratic lawmakers.

Still, we found his comparison misses some key points.

What is the foreign emoluments clause?

Essentially, the foreign emoluments clause prohibits high-level U.S. officials from accepting gifts or benefits from foreign governments.

The Constitution’s framers designed the clause to safeguard against corruption and foreign influence and prevent federal officials from cutting deals with foreign governments that are not in the United States’ best interest.

The clause has rarely been tested in court, but the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel has examined it about 50 times over 150 years in order to advise government officials about what’s prohibited, said Kathleen Clark, professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis.

Trump’s hotels

Trump has backed off day-to-day control of his businesses, but he’s still an owner, and critics have accused him of letting foreign officials stay at his hotel in an effort to curry his favor.

In addition to congressional Democrats, a number of private parties and the attorneys general from Washington, D.C., and Maryland filed lawsuits against Trump — so far without success.

The three major lawsuits have alleged that Trump is violating the foreign emoluments clause through his continued business activity and his failure to seek congressional approval on business matters involving foreign governments.

But at this point, only the congressional Democrats’ lawsuit has avoided being dismissed, and no decision has been made on the Justice Department’s request to stop it. Until that case wraps up, it remains unclear whether Trump has violated the foreign emoluments clause.

Eastman said Trump is safe, because his business is ""a corporation, a separate legal entity.""

""Normal business transactions have never been viewed as emoluments,"" he said. ""If they are, then a large number of presidents have been in violation.""

But no president has ever had wealth or holdings like Trump. Since Trump took office, several foreign countries have hosted national holiday celebrations at his Washington hotel, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the Philippines, per NBC Washington. An entire section of the Democrats’ lawsuit is devoted to Trump’s ""acceptance of payments for hotel rooms and events.""

""Foreign governments are deciding to hold events at the Trump hotel, providing a benefit to President Trump through his company,"" Clark said. ""That’s exactly the sort of thing that the Justice Department prohibited in the past.""

Obama’s Peace Prize

That’s hardly comparable to the benefits Obama received when he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009.

""The foreign emoluments clause applies when you get something from a foreign government, and what the Department of Justice opined when Obama won the Peace Prize was that the money wasn’t coming from a foreign government,"" said Andy Grewal, professor of law at the University of Iowa.

Eastman told us that although Obama donated the prize’s cash award to charity, he received ""a direct honor and remuneration from an entity that is quasi-governmental.""

But as we noted in 2009, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee is an independent body, even though its members are appointed by the Norwegian parliament. The reason the parliament is involved is because prize founder Alfred Nobel said he wanted it to select the committee.

That level of separation matters, Clark said, because a central issue in emoluments cases is whether the foreign government is actually deciding to provide the benefits to a U.S. official.

""Sometimes the benefit is coming from an organization that has some connection to a foreign government, but the decision to give the benefit isn’t actually coming from a foreign government,"" she said. ""It has to do with who’s making the decision.""

Other examples

At the same time, Grewal agreed with Eastman that a court decision against Trump could mean other U.S. presidents have also violated the foreign emoluments clause — including Obama.

Specifically, he pointed to a footnote in the opinion on the recently dismissed case, where the judge refused to speculate on the Justice Department’s claim that royalties Obama got from overseas book sales could qualify as emoluments for the same reasons as Trump’s hotel revenues. (Grewal made this very argument himself in the Yale Journal of Regulation's blog.)

But Clark said any application of the foreign emoluments clause to Obama’s book sales would depend again on which entity decided to deliver the benefit — or, in this case, order the books.

In the case of Obama selling books to public universities overseas, Clark said the clear line between the universities and the foreign government should eliminate emolument concerns.

The same reasoning would apply to Eastman’s foreign stocks example, Clark added. Only if the corporation is controlled by a foreign government would a president with stocks be in violation of the foreign emoluments clause.

""Simply having a tie to the foreign government isn’t sufficient to trigger the prohibition of the foreign emoluments clause,"" she said. ""The analogy is completely misplaced and misleading."""
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/jun/27/fact-checking-larry-elders-reparations-chatter-fox/,2019-06-27T00:00:00,Fact-checking Larry Elder’s reparations chatter on 'Fox & Friends',"Conservative commentator and radio show host Larry Elder made a series of claims about slavery and civil rights during a June 20 appearance on ""Fox & Friends.""

His remarks came after anchor Ainsley Earhardt called attention to a moment during the June 19 congressional hearing on reparations when former NFL athlete Burgess Owens said he left the Democratic Party because it was ""part of slavery.""

""Republicans did not own slaves,"" Elder said. ""Democrats owned slaves. Democrats founded the KKK. Democrats opposed the 13th Amendment, the 14th Amendment, the 15th Amendment. As a percentage of the party, more Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than did Democrats. Maybe Democrats ought to sue themselves for reparations.""

That’s a lot to unpack, so we decided to break Elder’s statement up into four parts. We reached out to Kevin Kruse, professor of history at Princeton University, who has addressed some of the same claims on Twitter. Then we talked to a few other historians for their thoughts.

One detail we’ll mention at the top: The political parties of the past are not the same parties we know today. In fact, they reversed platforms midway through the 20th century.

Elaine Frantz, professor of history at Kent State University, said Reconstruction-era Republicans were focused on strengthening federal control over the former confederacy to protect civil rights. As a result, the party enjoyed support from the majority of black southerners.

Democrats, on the other hand, wanted to ""restore the economic and political power of the former slaveholding elites and suppress black political and economic advances,"" Frantz said. Most white southerners were Democrats.

""This alignment changes in the 1920s and 1930s,"" Frantz said, noting how black Americans were swayed to the Democratic Party as Republicans focused on law-and-order policing and Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt pushed for social and economic justice.

This context matters, because Elder’s claims could imply to many that today’s Democrats would have been pro-slavery in another era.

""Republicans did not own slaves. Democrats owned slaves.""

The claim that Republicans did not own slaves is false, and Elder corrected the record on Twitter the next day.

""Republicans were obviously the party of abolition, but there were in fact Republicans who owned slaves,"" Kruse told us.

Francis P. Blair, one of the Republican Party’s founders, owned slaves while he presided over the 1856 Republican convention and was a delegate in 1860, Kruse said.

Benjamin Burton, who served twice as a state legislator in Delaware under the Whig party before becoming a Republican later in life, also owned slaves, according to his obituary. In fact, his 28 slaves made him Delaware’s leading slave-owner.

Blair and Burton were not the only two. After conservative filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza made a similar claim on Twitter, Kruse and other historians on Twitter identified eight more prominent Republicans who also owned slaves in 1860.

""As to no Republicans ever owning slaves, I was wrong, and I've corrected it on social media,"" Elder said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""There were at least 10.""

""Democrats founded the KKK.""

The claim that Democrats founded the KKK claim is misleading, and PolitiFact has fact-checked similar claims twice before, in 2013 and 2018.

Many southern whites during the 1860s and 1870s were, in fact, Democrats, and some joined the Ku Klux Klan. But there’s no evidence that the group was founded by the Democratic Party. As we’ve noted in our previous fact-checks, the KKK was more of a grassroots development.

Historians disagree on the exact year the KKK took form. But they do agree that it was founded between 1865 and 1867 by a group of Confederate veterans in Pulaski, Tenn., as a social fraternity that quickly morphed into a violent white supremacy group.

""The men who started the Klan were southerners and almost certainly voted Democrat, but that’s a far cry from the claim that the party set up the organization,"" Kruse said.

Frantz said the original KKK only existed in a ""meaningful way"" until 1871. Around 1920, a new, larger organization adopted the name. ""And while the second Klan stood for different things in different regions, it was much more tied to the Republican than the Democratic Party,"" she said.

""The Klan’s later history showed alliances with both parties,"" Kruse added. ""At its peak power in the 1920s, the Klan aligned with the Democrats and Republicans in different states.""

Kruse said the KKK had particularly strong footing in Indiana, where the group’s leader was ""a kingmaker in GOP politics and took down several GOP officials with a scandal.""

""Democrats opposed the 13th Amendment, the 14th Amendment, the 15th Amendment.""

It’s accurate that Democrats opposed the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments.

The 13th Amendment abolished slavery, the 14th Amendment granted citizenship and equal protection under the law to anyone born in the United States, and the 15th Amendment guaranteed voting rights for men of all races.

Historians we spoke to said the majority of Reconstruction-era Democrats did, in fact, oppose these three amendments. Republicans led the way each time.

""As a percentage of the party, more Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.""

More Republicans did vote for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but the statement needs context, and the votes had bipartisan majorities.

The act, best known for barring discrimination in public accommodations, was proposed by Democratic President John F. Kennedy and signed into law by Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson.

It first passed the House on Feb. 10, 1964, by a margin of 290-130. We looked at how members of each party voted in a 2010 fact-check.

As we noted, 61% of Democrats (152 yeas and 96 nays) and 80% of Republicans (138 yeas and 34 nays) voted for the bill to pass the House.

The Senate passed the bill on June 19, 1964, by a 73-27 margin, with about 69% of Democrats (46 yeas, 21 nays) and 82% of Republicans (27 yeas, 6 nays) voting for the measure on final passage.

So, in both chambers of Congress, a greater percentage of Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than Democrats. Elder was right.

Kruse said the claim can be misleading when used to suggest Republicans ""were the prime mover on civil rights laws in the 1960s,"" since the act was proposed by a Democratic president, signed by a Democratic president and passed through a Democrat-led Congress.

In a Twitter thread, Kruse argued that the votes were split more by region than by party, with southern members of both parties resisting the bill and northern members supporting it."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/jun/13/how-pundits-defended-trumps-abc-interview-and-why-/,2019-06-13T00:00:00,"How pundits defended Trump's ABC interview, and why it's misleading","Pundits on both sides reacted to President Donald Trump’s declaration during an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that he would accept dirt on his 2020 opponent from a foreign power and might not tell the FBI that he’s done so.

But while many have condemned the remarks, some conservative commentators defended Trump by saying Hillary Clinton did the same thing.

""We know definitively that a presidential candidate did do it because Hillary Clinton did, and her campaign and the DNC paid for a foreigner's information on her opponent,"" said CNN guest Rob Astorino during a June 12 panel on ""Cuomo Prime Time.""

Astorino was referring to the Steele dossier, a collection of memos produced by former British spy Christopher Steele that made claims about Trump’s ties to Russia and was partially paid for by the Clinton campaign.

Other conservative commentators raised similar points.

""Hillary Clinton literally empowered a foreign agent who produced a dossier full of Russian lies that was used to infiltrate our electoral process,"" said Fox News host Sean Hannity.

""Hillary Clinton took information from a foreign government,"" added Mollie Hemingway, an editor at The Federalist and a contributor on Fox News. ""The Democratic National Committee secretly paid for this dossier that by their own accounting was sourced to government officials in Russia.""

Do these pundits have a point? We wondered how Clinton’s funding of the Steele dossier compares to the scenario Stephanopoulos asked Trump about, so we asked some experts.

Put simply, the two are not the same.

What Trump said

Trump’s controversial statement came after Stephanopoulos asked if he would alert the FBI in the event that a foreign government like Russia offered dirt on an election opponent, or if he would take the information.

""I think maybe you do both,"" Trump said. ""I think you might want to listen. There’s nothing wrong with listening.""

""It’s not an interference,"" he added. ""They have information. I think I’d take it.""

They have information. I think I’d take it."" https://t.co/bewhYcvoSa pic.twitter.com/o5rsz75TSd — ABC News (@ABC) June 13, 2019

Trump’s comments put him at odds with FBI Director Christopher Wray, who said in testimony before Congress that the FBI would like to know if a public official or campaign were contacted by a foreign government about influencing an election.

The remarks are also significant given the Trump campaign’s role in the infamous Trump Tower meeting, during which Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian government lawyer after being told she had derogatory information on Hillary Clinton to give the campaign.

What happened with Clinton and the Steele dossier

Steele, a former British intelligence agent, created the Steele dossier on behalf of Fusion GPS, a U.S.-based opposition research firm that was hired to work for the Clinton campaign.

But the firm’s research into Trump was already underway when the Clinton campaign got involved. It was originally hired by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website.

It was only after Trump secured the Republican nomination that Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee by their law firm, Perkins Coie, to continue compiling research about Trump.

At that point, the firm hired Steele, who had sources in Russia. Steele produced 35 pages of research memos, which became collectively known as the Steele dossier and detailed some salacious — but not fully verified — claims about Trump.

How the two are different

Experts we spoke to described a range of differences between the type of information Trump said he would accept and what Clinton’s campaign was paying Fusion GPS for.

The main difference is the role of a foreign government.

""Working hand-in-hand with a foreign power for information intended to influence an election is different than hiring a private firm that then hired somebody who had been a former intelligence agent,"" said Karen Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham Law.

""Everybody does opposition research,"" she added. ""The issue here is the foreign government.""

That distinction is critical, experts told us, because a foreign government that interferes in American politics is likely to have a stake in what happens on Election Day.

While Russia’s meddling was intended to help Trump win, Steele was contracted by Fusion GPS to find out more about Trump’s ties to Russia. ""That has nothing to do with a candidate soliciting something from a foreign power,"" former CIA intelligence agent Glenn Carle said.

""One is collecting intelligence and the other is an active measure by a foreign power to achieve a political end of some sort,"" Carle said. ""There’s no comparison at all.""

A foreign government could also take measures that Steele, a private British citizen, would not have been capable of, said Max Bergmann, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress and an expert on U.S.-Russia policy. Russia, for example, used its intelligence apparatus to hack the Clinton campaign and steal damaging information.

""Steele is not a member of the U.K. government, so it’s not like they (the Clinton campaign) were working with a foreign government that was trying to interfere in our election,"" Bergmann said. ""They’re not in the same ballpark."""

""Speaker Pelosi now apparently telling senior Democrats she’d like to see Trump behind bars,"" Hannity said during the June 6, 2019, episode of ""Hannity,"" his TV program. ""Based on no actual crimes, she wants a political opponent locked up in prison? That happens in banana republics.""

Hannity said such calls are ""beyond despicable"" and that jailing Trump would turn the United States into a country people would no longer recognize.

But his comments had social media users saying he himself had become unrecognizable.

That’s because Hannity has often said former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should go to prison for using a private email server during her stint as secretary of state.

Through a spokesperson, Hannity described a difference between his comments on Clinton and Pelosi’s more recent remarks about Trump.

""Donald Trump committed no crime,"" he said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""The evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible that Hillary Clinton committed multiple felonies by putting ‘classified’ and ‘Top Secret’ information on a private server.""

""Crowds that chanted ‘Lock her up’ were clearly referring to that,"" he said. ""Nancy Pelosi cannot identify a ‘crime’ committed by President Trump. She just wants a political opponent put in jail.""

But Hannity is wrong that Pelosi’s comments were completely baseless. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report specifically said, ""While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""

Meanwhile, former FBI director James Comey testified under oath that Clinton’s handling of her emails was ""extremely reckless"" but not criminal, as PolitiFact has noted before.

Besides that, we decided to check out how many times Hannity has aired clips of Trump calling for Clinton to be locked up and welcomed guests on his show who said the same. (Spoiler: He’s done so a lot.)

We found that he’s also made similar statements of his own on Twitter, the radio and TV.

A 2016 episode of Hannity’s radio show was titled, ""Clinton should be in jail,"" for example, and in a now-deleted tweet from 2017, Hannity asked, ""When will Hillary Clinton be indicted?"" During a 2018 appearance on Fox News, he said, ""I think Hillary should be in jail. Lock her up.""

Then there’s his Fox News show, where Clinton-related scandals are a favorite topic of discussion.

In a review of ""Hannity"" using the Internet Archive, PolitiFact identified at least three dozen times dating back to 2015 where Hannity suggested Clinton should be behind bars. Here are just a few examples of Hannity’s comments, with links to additional context:

- Aug. 13, 2015: ""Based on what you know, do you think Hillary Clinton should go to jail over the server scandal? … Let us know what you think.""

- Sept. 8, 2015: ""Can Hillary go to jail? We’ll examine that next.""

- July 13, 2016: ""Hillary should be happy she’s not in jail or not being prosecuted, in my opinion.""

- Oct. 10, 2016: ""I’m watching these other channels: ‘Never before in the history of this country has anyone said that the opponent should be in jail.’ I’m like, ‘Never before in the history of the country did anyone break the law like she did.’""

- Nov. 1, 2016: ""Hillary Clinton — follow my words, the media won’t say it — she should be in jail, not on the campaign trail. It’s about time somebody said it.""

- Nov. 3, 2016: ""Hillary Clinton is campaigning to be the next president. She should be the one in jail.""

- May 9, 2017: ""If you or I, anybody in this audience, did anything close to what Hillary Clinton did, you would be put in jail.""

- Aug. 3, 2017: ""If they’re going to investigate these things, they’ve got to investigate Hillary … When are they going to be put in jail?""

- Oct. 26, 2017: ""Beyond serious stuff. This is go-to-jail type of things.""

- Oct. 30, 2017: ""If you or I, if anybody in this room with me now or watching TV with you, if we ever did anything close to what the Clintons, the DNC and others did, we would be rotting in a jail cell tonight … why hasn’t she been charged?""

- Nov. 6, 2017: ""Comey, the Obama Justice Department, were protecting Hillary Clinton for laws she broke that we’d be put in jail for.""

- Jan. 2, 2018: ""There are very, very nervous — rightly so — people like Hillary Clinton. They should be nervous. People will be going to jail, I promise you.""

- July 6, 2018: ""There have been other people that have gone to jail for far less than what Hillary Clinton did.""

- March 7, 2019: ""By the way, when is Hillary going to be charged?""

- April 23, 2019: ""Rush (Limbaugh) was great earlier tonight, wasn’t he, when he said, ‘Oh, Hillary needs to be in jail and indicted. If you did what she did, you would be in jail.’"""

On the front page of the April 6 New York Times was a headline that read, ""Attacks by White Extremists Are Growing. So Are Their Connections.""

That same day, the Wall Street Journal carried a story headlined, ""Are Far-Right Extremist Crimes Rising? No.""

These dueling headlines certainly look like conflicting narratives. How could these outlets seem to arrive at such different conclusions?

The short answer, PunditFact found: The newspapers measured different things.

They examined different kinds of perpetrators, covered different geographic areas and used different time frames. Additionally, some imprecise wording in both headlines — plus analytical fuzziness by the Wall Street Journal — added to the confusion.

Overall, our review suggests that terrorist attacks by far-right extremists are going up in certain parts of the world. Separately, the more general category of homicides by far-right extremists — which includes terrorist attacks — have basically held steady in the United States for decades, according to at least one major U.S. extremist crime database.

New York Times: White extremist terror attacks on the rise

The New York Times focused exclusively on white extremist terrorist attacks, while the Wall Street Journal explored a broader range of far-right homicides, of which terrorism is a small subset.

To tally the numbers, the New York Times relied on the Global Terrorism Database. This dataset, which goes back to 1970, essentially defines terrorism as intentional acts of violence by non-government actors to achieve political or religious goals, or to sow fear. (You can read their precise definition here.)

The Global Terrorism Database — which is maintained by the University of Maryland’s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism — has not systematically coded for attackers’ ideology. So to obtain a count of terrorist attacks carried out by white extremists in particular, the New York Times performed additional analysis.

Ultimately, the New York Times landed on a definition of ""white extremist"" that encompassed white nationalist, white supremacist, neo-Nazi, xenophobic, anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic ideologies. (A full explanation of their methodology is here.)

The New York Times identified 347 white extremist terrorist attacks in Europe, North America and Australia from 2011 through 2017, and included some preliminary data on U.S. attacks in 2018. The Wall Street Journal, for its part, used different geographic and temporal slices.

For the New York Times, their choice of data served dual functions. In addition to charting numerical trends, the journalists also drew ideological connections between high-profile incidents, to illustrate what the paper described as ""an informal global network of white extremists.""

For instance, the article notes that the shooter who killed 50 people in an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, drew inspiration from far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 in Norway in 2011, as well as other perpetrators.

""All these attacks occurred amid a surge of white supremacist and xenophobic terrorism in the West that has frequently targeted Muslims, immigrants and other minority groups,"" the New York Times reported. The following graph, which ran alongside the story, shows the uptick in white extremist terror attacks over the relevant period:

Source: The New York Times.

Wall Street Journal: Far-right homicides in U.S. have held steady

While the New York Times looked only at white extremist terror attacks, the Wall Street Journal sought to focus primarily on the more general category of far-right homicides. But along the way, it made several additional assertions, including some that were unsubstantiated, and which PolitiFact was unable to confirm.

The article appeared as part of the Wall Street Journal’s weekly Numbers column, which, gives a ""look at the use of numbers in news, business and politics.""

A spokesperson for the Journal characterized the article’s thesis as follows: While far-right terrorism is up, far-right homicides — including those which do not meet the definition of terrorism — have essentially held steady for decades.

In contrast to the New York Times’ coverage, the spokesperson said, ""The Journal chose to report on the broader category of fatal attacks.""

To back up its assertion about far-right homicides staying flat, it relied on the U.S. Extremist Crime Database. This crime database tracks not only terror attacks, but also incidents that aren’t captured in the Global Terrorism Database, like financial and certain violent crimes by adherents of an ""extremist belief system."" (You can read their methodology here).

If the Wall Street Journal had looked only at far-right homicides over time, its thesis would be clearly backed up with hard numbers, as the following graph that accompanied the Journal article shows.

Source: The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the U.S. Extremist Crime Database.

But the Wall Street Journal article went out on a limb — several limbs, in fact.

The headline on the digital version says that far-right extremist crime — not just homicides, but also ""hate crimes and related violence"" — have held steady since at least 1970. But it does not back this broader claim up with hard numbers.

For instance, the article presents no data to show that far-right vandalism targeting minorities has held steady for decades, notes Erin Miller, who manages the Global Terrorism Database. The directors of the Extremist Crime Database also did not provide PunditFact with evidence about non-fatal extremist crimes.

The Journal article also waded into the controversial debate over President Donald Trump’s recent statements about white nationalism. The article’s first sentence says that Trump is correct that white nationalism is not on the rise in the United States. Yet the article never defines ""white nationalism"" — in fact, the term is not mentioned a second time.

As we’ve written, data from multiple sources suggest extremist attacks associated with white nationalism and far-right ideology are on the rise.

According to Miller of the Global Terrorism Database, the Wall Street Journal seems to have blurred some key distinctions.

The article appears to conflate far-right extremist crimes (which include both violence and non-violence) and white nationalism (an idea), Miller said, and then uses the number of fatal events (a small subset of extremist crimes) to represent both.

""I think the author of the article attempted to disentangle these concepts somewhat,"" she said. ""But referencing various datasets in the same analysis is extremely difficult and prone to confusion.""

In fairness, the headlines of both the New York Times and Journal articles can be faulted for imprecision. It’s also worth noting that reporters do not always have final say over headlines.

""Arguably, the New York Times title should reference ‘terrorist attacks’ instead of ‘attacks,’ "" Miller said.

David Sterman, a policy analyst at the left-leaning think tank New America, said the weekend’s coverage highlighted the need for more data-driven research — as well as greater transparency and precision.

""Overall this is an important debate that needs to occur with clarity regarding definitions and objectivity,"" he said."
https://www.politifact.com/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/feb/28/did-michael-cohens-testimony-back-buzzfeeds-beleag/,2019-02-28T00:00:00,Did Michael Cohen’s testimony back up BuzzFeed’s beleaguered scoop?,"The blockbuster testimony of President Donald Trump’s former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen drew fresh attention to a BuzzFeed News report that has been assailed as inaccurate. Some said his testimony corroborated the report, while others hearing Cohen said it did little to prop up the report’s central assertion.

We’ll help you sort out the differing takes.

In January, BuzzFeed News reported that Trump had explicitly ordered Cohen to lie by telling Congress that negotiations over a Trump Tower Moscow proposal ended earlier in the 2016 presidential campaign season than they actually had.

Cohen certainly did lie to lawmakers about the project: He pled guilty in the Southern District of New York for doing so. Cohen admitted to falsely telling Congress he had briefed Trump on the the Russian-based development proposal only three times, and that negotiations broke down in January 2016.

In fact, talks continued as late as June 2016, after Trump became the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee, and updates had been more extensive than what Cohen said.

When he entered his guilty plea in a Manhattan federal court in Nov. 2018, Cohen said fealty to Trump drove his behavior.

""I made these misstatements to be consistent with individual 1’s political messaging and out of loyalty to individual 1,"" Cohen, who previously identified ""individual 1"" as Trump, said in court, according to Reuters.

Two months later, BuzzFeed dropped its report. ""President Trump Directed His Attorney Michael Cohen To Lie To Congress About The Moscow Tower Project,"" the headline read.

""Cohen's testimony marks a significant new frontier,"" BuzzFeed wrote, citing two unnamed federal law enforcement officials involved in investigating the matter. ""It is the first known example of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie directly about his own dealings with Russia.""

The report also claimed Cohen personally updated Trump about the construction proposal 10 times, and said Trump had encouraged a plan by Cohen for Trump to meet personally with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign.

But the bombshell claim was undeniably this: Trump had directed Cohen to lie under oath, a felony known as suborning perjury.

In a rare move, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team issued a public statement denying the report, and Trump said the story was ""a disgrace to journalism.""

So, what did Cohen have to say about why he lied, and whether he was directed by Trump?

Cohen told lawmakers he lied out of a sense of loyalty to the president, and to harmonize with Trump’s political messaging. He also said he was driven to lie because Trump had indirectly told him to do so.

""Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates,"" Cohen said, reading from prepared remarks. ""In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing.

""In his way,"" Cohen said, ""he was telling me to lie.""

To some, Cohen’s claim positively contradicted BuzzFeed.

""BuzzFeed alleged Trump ‘directed’ and ‘personally instructed’ Cohen to lie,"" tweeted Washington Post Justice Department reporter Matt Zapotosky. ""Cohen says the opposite of that. ‘Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates.’ ""

Zapotosky quickly posted another tweet pointing out that Cohen ""later suggests he knew Trump wanted him to lie to Congress,"" which noted that Cohen seemed to conclude this based on intuition.

But that didn’t placate some media members who took issue with Zapotosky’s characterization that Cohen’s testimony said ""the opposite"" of BuzzFeed’s findings.

""This is some wildly persnickety nonsense, my dude, and it seems to intentionally miss the forest for the trees,"" tweeted NBC News reporter Ben Collins. BuzzFeed’s Director of Communications zeroed in on the characterization too.

As the explicit versus implicit debate rages on, it’s safe to say the extent to which Cohen’s testimony does or doesn’t support BuzzFeed’s report is open to interpretation.

Meanwhile, BuzzFeed told the Washington Post it stands by its report."

For example, in New Jersey on Saturday, Governor Phil Murphy issued Executive Order 107 in response to the coronavirus crisis, shuttering all “non-essential” businesses until further notice.

Besides having a potentially catastrophic impact on the state’s economy, the order deemed gun stores “non-essential” and therefore ordered them closed (shutting off the flow of firearms and ammunition to honest citizens, who may need them in times of emergency).

Additionally, Ammoland.com reports, “The National Instant Check System in NJ (NICS) for processing all firearms and ammunition transactions has been shut down completely; and all ranges (indoor and outdoor, public and private) are ordered closed under a restriction on ‘recreational activities’ (is developing proficiency to defend your life really just ‘recreation?’).”

As if stripping law-abiding Americans of their right to defense during a national health crisis and potentially impending economic depression isn’t bad enough, the state also decided to begin releasing thousands of criminals from jails due to coronavirus risks.

That’s right, New Jersey citizens are ordered to “stay at home” and are threatened with “criminal consequences” by law enforcement if they defy the state’s new regulations while lawbreakers are being freed.

“If you’re a retail store or an entertainment center and you stay open, or if you’re a bar and you keep serving patrons in your establishment, consider this as your final warning,” the state’s Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said.

“Same goes for individuals. If you and your friends decide to throw a party in your home and you invite 20 of your closest friends, stop,” he added. “Law enforcement officers will have to break that party up and there will be criminal consequences.”

So, according to the New Jersey government, don’t party, don’t leave your home and don’t you dare defend yourself from one of the criminals they have recently released into an increasingly volatile society.

If you do decide to party, AG Grewal announced on Monday those who defy the order could face up to six months of jail time or up to $1,000 in fines.

As the state’s governor recently declared a “stay at home” order and is considering announcing Martial Law, police departments are preparing for potential unrest.

“We have not traditionally mounted speakers to our drones, but … if we need to cover a large area to get an announcement out, or if there were a crowd somewhere that we needed to disperse, we could do it without getting police officers involved,” said Chula Vista Police Capt. Vern Sallee.

Sallee added, “We have not traditionally mounted speakers to our drones, but … if we need to cover a large area to get an announcement out, or if there were a crowd somewhere that we needed to disperse, we could do it without getting police officers involved.”

“The outbreak has changed my view of expanding the program as rapidly as I can,” Sallee explained.

The police captain also explained how the flying devices could be used to conduct operations that could put officers in harm’s way.

For example, Sallee said homeless people could be contacted via the drone’s microphone, noting, “We need to tell them we actually have resources for them — they are vulnerable right now. It might be impractical or unsafe for our officers to be put into those areas.”

The drones were purchased from a Chinese company called DJI, the world’s largest civilian drone manufacturer.

Spencer Gore, chief executive of U.S.-based drone company Impossible Aerospace, says his company is “working like crazy” to provide drones for police departments around the country who are suddenly in the market to buy.

“What we saw in China, and what we’re probably going to see around the world, is using drones with cameras and loudspeakers to fly around to see if people are gathering where they shouldn’t be, and telling them to go home,” Gore said, admitting, “It seems a little Orwellian, but this could save lives.”

China even used drones to enforce the country’s mandatory protective face mask order, as The Washington Examiner reported, a human rights activist named Jennifer Zeng tweeted out a video of drones operating in China, saying, “Traffic police in Muyang, China, using a drone to check on passengers and then giving orders remotely via loudspeaker. Traffic officers blasted, ‘Where is your mask? Wear your mask!,’ in Chinese through the drones that had audio capabilities.”

Drones were used for COVID-19 regulation enforcement in Brussels as well.

Czech Crisis Staff head Roman Prymula told Czech Television that border controls may have to be kept in place for an extended period in order to restrict the entry of people from other European countries that have been harder hit by coronavirus.

“The situation in other European countries will not be good, there it will take months and long months,” said Prymula.

Czech Minister of Health Adam Vojtech amplified Prymula’s suggestion.

“The point is to avoid having a second or third wave of the epidemic, so that people from other countries such as Italy, France, Spain, Germany, do not begin to flow [into the Czech Republic],” he told Czech Television.

Quarantine measures that restrict the movement of people and have mandated the closure of restaurants and other businesses, as well as the wearing of face coverings in public, will be extended in the Czech. Republic until at least April 1st.

The measures have been successful, with Prymula highlighting how authorities were able to “flatten the curve” of infections and keep the rate under control.

The country has largely escaped the impact of coronavirus in comparison to other European countries, recording 1,236 cases but just a single death.

Vit Rakusan, leader of the opposition STAN party, said the idea of closing the border for 2 years was draconian.

“I understand and support the ban on traveling during current culmination of the epidemic. But scaring people with two years, this must not be a decision of an epidemiologist, however prominent,” he asserted.

Czech Crisis Staff head Roman Prymula told Czech Television that border controls may have to be kept in place for an extended period in order to restrict the entry of people from other European countries that have been harder hit by coronavirus.

“The situation in other European countries will not be good, there it will take months and long months,” said Prymula.

Czech Minister of Health Adam Vojtech amplified Prymula’s suggestion.

“The point is to avoid having a second or third wave of the epidemic, so that people from other countries such as Italy, France, Spain, Germany, do not begin to flow [into the Czech Republic],” he told Czech Television.

Quarantine measures that restrict the movement of people and have mandated the closure of restaurants and other businesses, as well as the wearing of face coverings in public, will be extended in the Czech. Republic until at least April 1st.

The measures have been successful, with Prymula highlighting how authorities were able to “flatten the curve” of infections and keep the rate under control.

The country has largely escaped the impact of coronavirus in comparison to other European countries, recording 1,236 cases but just a single death.

Vit Rakusan, leader of the opposition STAN party, said the idea of closing the border for 2 years was draconian.

“I understand and support the ban on traveling during current culmination of the epidemic. But scaring people with two years, this must not be a decision of an epidemiologist, however prominent,” he asserted.

French residents are now required to produce a government form stating their purpose for travel any time they are outside of their homes, as Infowars Europe has reported.

In Cagnes-sur-Mer, a driver allegedly refused to comply with police orders at a mandatory checkpoint and attempted to flee in a reckless manner that endangered the life of an officer, who ultimately responded with deadly force.

“During the check, the driver stopped, had a brief exchange with a police officer before suddenly driving towards a police officer, according to a witness and the victim themself,” local prosecutor Fabienne Atzori told Ouest France.

“According to the witness, the policeman’s life was at risk.”

The officer fired shots at the vehicle, but the driver fled the scene and was still at large on Monday.

The driver is now wanted for “refusal to comply and committing intentional violence with a weapon against a person holding public authority.""

Multiple travelers are also facing penalties for refusing to comply at checkpoints.

“Since this Saturday, we have had an increase in inappropriate behavior during controls,” said Atzori.

“They're not all as serious, but they do show that some people are showing firm opposition to these types of checks.”

The announcement follows reports earlier in the day which claimed the Democrat mayor was drafting measures similar to those passed in Dallas County, which “banned all public and private gatherings outside of a home,” according to The Statesman.

“The new rules have the force of law, and there can be fines associated with somebody that doesn’t follow them,” Adler said in an interview with KUT.org. “But the truth is, ultimately we’re never going to have the ability to be able to enforce something like this everywhere.”

The City of Austin, Texas, is reportedly drafting shelter-in-place orders that would affect surrounding Travis County, according to local media.

The reports come as other Texas counties have issued similar orders in the past two days, including Waco and Dallas counties.

On Monday, Mayor Steve Adler declared he was “absolutely” considering similar restrictions in the Texas capital to reduce the spread of coronavirus.

“We want to make sure that we are prepared,” Adler stated. “(A shelter-in-place order) is part of the emergency planning that is happening. There are discussions happening right now to that issue.”

“No timeline has been set for if and when any order would be put in place, but Adler told the American-Statesman on Monday that one could be issued at the drop of a hat if medical authorities determine such an order is necessary,” the Austin American-Statesman added.

Adler says the order would be similar to one issued in Dallas county, which “requires everyone to shelter at home. All businesses, except those deemed essential, must also close,” reports CBS Austin.

There have been 79 confirmed cases of the Chinese virus in Travis county.

Nearly all businesses in the City of Austin have been shuttered since last week in compliance with social distancing guidelines recommended by the CDC.

Hawley Calls Out WHO’s ChiCom Ties,"Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri called out the World Health Organization on Twitter Sunday night, saying, “There needs to be consequences” for the globalist organization siding with Communist China against the world over COVID-19.

“There needs to be consequences here,” Hawley wrote. “WHO has sided w/ China Communist Party against the world in this pandemic.”

There need to be consequences here. WHO has sided w/ #China Communist Party against the world in this pandemic https://t.co/iTvuZxO9bI — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) March 23, 2020

Hawley is referring to World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was selected as the organization’s leader after receiving backing from China in 2017.

In addition to support from China, the CFR reported, “Tedros was the favorite candidate of the Obama administration, but was not the Trump administration’s first choice.”

The top globalist is clearly staying loyal to the corrupt Chinese government who helped him assume power while simultaneously attempting to get back at a Trump administration who didn’t support him and even proposed cutting the global health budget by 26 percent.

Tedros has continuously praised China’s handling of the pandemic, saying, “We appreciate the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak, especially the commitment from top leadership, and the transparency they have demonstrated, including sharing data and genetic sequence of the virus.”

After meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of January, Tedros claimed, “China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response.”

Meanwhile, Tedros is bad-mouthing the Trump administration for cutting off travel from COVID-19 hotspots, stating, “There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. We call on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent.”

WHO even sided with China regarding a report from the communist nation claiming there was “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission” of COVID-19.

A lawyer for the abortion facility responded to a letter from the office of state Attorney General Dave Yost, asserting the order allows Planned Parenthood to “still continue providing essential procedures, including surgical abortion.”

CBS News reported a spokesperson for Yost’s office, however, said Ohio abortion providers must stop performing the procedure.

Police Make Sure of It.,"The last days and weeks of the coronavirus epidemic give an interesting insight into the human psyche. Elementary liberties are restricted all over the world, such as the freedom of movement or private property. Yet most people accept these restrictions without blinking, as the state declares their indispensability.

A chronology of the events in Madrid: on Sunday, March 8, a large World Women’s Day demonstration against the alleged rule of the Patriachate was held. There were 120,000 particiants, and members of the government took part in it, marching side by side in the first row. They had called for strong participation. Just one day later it was announced that starting on Wednesday, March 11, kindergartens, schools, and universities in Madrid would be closed. Since Sunday, March 14, there a curfew has been in place, which is enforced by police and military force. Cyclists and joggers trying to keep fit in the fresh air have been fined heavily. Spaniards are no longer even allowed to be in the private gardens of apartment blocks, even if families take turns using them. In short, we are no longer allowed to use our own gardens. They have been temporarily expropriated.

Most people are little bothered by the fact that the state is violating their freedom massively. They regard it as necessary and good. They do not question the state´s authority to restrict our freedom at all. Rather, they denounce those who want to move freely and make use of their property rights. When two brothers were seen playing soccer in the garden of an acquaintance’s apartment block, the police were called.

People denounce playing children, who are regarded as harmful to public health, and put up posters saying “Quédate en casa” (stay at home). This is a block warden mentality. The most worrying thing is the high number of willing state collaborators. The parallels with the past are unnoticed. No one seems to care, and it is not even discussed.

If people are just scared enough, they entrust themselves to a (temporary) dictatorship without grumbling. They give up their freedom in the hope of being saved by state leaders advised by wise experts. Fear makes people controllable. Instead of protesting against the violation of their property rights, they clap their hands every day at 8 p.m. in Spain. Initially, the applause was mainly to show support for doctors and nurses, but in the meantime cheers for the police have been mixed in.

The state leaders plan the violation of liberty centrally. They do not have the necessary information to give a rational answer to the coronacrisis. They take into account the benefits of the curfew and economic shutdown but not the costs, because these are not quantifiable.

One of the immediate costs is the loss of a more rapid immunization of the population. But there are other health costs. Being confined to one’s own four walls, with the corresponding lack of physical exercise, will lead to increased cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, strokes, and thromboses, among other things. The psychological burden of being locked up is especially immense. The psychological strain will cause some marriages and families to break up; trauma and depression will be created.

The economic collapse triggered by the political reaction to the coronavirus has its own health costs, such as entrepreneurs who suffer heart attacks and unemployed people who fall into depression or alcohol.

And then there are the economic costs in the narrower sense. The standard of living will fall, perhaps considerably. That depends on how long economic life remains switched off. Sooner or later, supply chains will be threatened, even for essential medicines and food. Already today the range of products in Spanish supermarkets is reduced. This too can shorten lives. Worldwide, a decline in the standard of living will hit especially the poorest of the poor, whose supply of food and medicines will be greatly diminished.

As the costs and benefits are not quantifiable, it is hubris to rely on central planning to address the COVID-19 epidemic and come to the decision to paralyze an entire country—even entire continents (not to mention the (temporary) disappearance of freedom). Unfortunately, frightened people seem to shed few tears for freedom. There is a shortcut to serfdom, and it is called fear.

A YouTuber who licked a public toilet seat to “raise awareness” of coronavirus now claims he has tested positive for coronavirus.

Who could have seen that coming?

Shawn Mendes posted a video to Twitter where he licks a brown substance, believed to be foundation, from the toilet seat before saying, “coronavirus challenge.”

RT to spread awareness for the Coronavirus 🙂 pic.twitter.com/HNLx7fPhC0 — LARZ (@GAYSHAWNMENDES) March 21, 2020

The clip quickly went viral and has received well over 5 million views.

“Man, these people will do anything for clout. Clout is a disease,” responded one Twitter user.

The day after he posted the toilet video, Mendes tweeted another clip of himself sat in what appears to be a hospital bed.

I tested positive for Coronavirus 😥 pic.twitter.com/8GrI9hf23h — LARZ (@GAYSHAWNMENDES) March 22, 2020

“I tested positive for Coronavirus,” he claims.

Mendes previously embroiled himself in controversy when he was filmed taking a tub of ice scream from a store freezer, eating some of it and then putting it back.

I love ice cream pic.twitter.com/CWA1aNBmJU — LARZ (@GAYSHAWNMENDES) July 3, 2019

Mendes later claimed he received a police visit. Others who pulled the same stunt were arrested.

Of course, the overwhelming likelihood is that Mendes licking the toilet seat and then claiming he has COVID-19 is all a fake publicity stunt merely to gain attention.

The fact that he would hijack a global pandemic that has killed over 16,000 people and threatens to irreparably change the world as we know for clickbait tells you everything you need to know about the social media generation.

As we previously highlighted, the woman who started the “coronavirus challenge” by licking a toilet seat on a plane subsequently claimed that coronavirus “kills everyone who’s old enough to still have facebook,” and that “gays are immune to the virus.”

The cloture vote of the third installment of the coronavirus economic relief package failed Sunday at 47-47, as 60 votes were needed but 5 Republican senators missed the vote due to self-quarantine.

“Are you kidding me?” McConnell (R-Ky.) fumed on the Senate floor. “Why are Democrats filibustering the bipartisan bill they helped write? Appropriate question to ask this morning as the country waits on us.”

The Democrats revealed their latest demands Monday, which include solar and wind tax credits, carbon emissions standards, and massive collective bargaining powers for unions.

“Democrats won’t let us fund hospitals or save small businesses unless they get to dust off the Green New Deal,” McConnell said.

“I’d like to see Senate Democrats tell New York City doctors and nurses, who are literally overrun as we speak, that they’re filibustering hospital funding and more masks because they want to argue with the airlines over their carbon footprint!” he continued.

“I’d like to see Senate Democrats tell all American seniors, who’ve seen their hard-earned retirement savings literally melt away as the markets track toward their worst month since 1931, that they’re continuing to hold up emergency measures over tax credits for solar panels. Tax credits for solar panels.”

“So these are just few of the completely non-germane wishlist items that they’re rallying behind, preventing us from getting this emergency relief to the American people right now,” McConnell added.

Democrats even have a provision about “corporate board diversity.”

You can tell Democrats have a laser focus on helping Americans and the economy. pic.twitter.com/o9xwMgZ8PP — tedfrank (@tedfrank) March 23, 2020

On Sunday, McConnell said he switched his vote to “no” which allows a second vote.

The American people expect us to act. If we fail, it will be because Senate Democrats are continuing to dither while the country expects bold, bipartisan action. pic.twitter.com/23pFHoDtCl — Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) March 23, 2020

“I changed my vote which gives me the opportunity to move to reconsider at a later time. That’s all I can do in the face of obstruction. I can understand obstruction when you’re trying to achieve something. This obstruction achieves nothing,” McConnell said.

“We’ll have this cloture vote again at some point of my choosing and hopefully some adults will show up on the other side of the room and understand the gravity of the situation.”

The vote was expected to pass until House Speaker Nancy Pelosi intervened Sunday, announcing the House Democrats would put forth their own version of an economic relief package.

“It’s on the Senate side now because that’s their deadline for a vote, but we’ll be introducing our own bill and hopefully it’ll be compatible with what they discussed on the Senate,” Pelosi told reporters.

The Senate held another cloture vote again Monday, but the bill again failed to pass with a 49-46 vote.

“Today our city is celebrating the #LunarNewYear parade in Chinatown, a beautiful cultural tradition with a rich history in our city. I want to remind everyone to enjoy the parade and not change any plans due to misinformation spreading about #coronavirus,” she wrote.

On the same day, Mark D. Levine, Chair of New York City Council health committee, lauded how “huge crowds gathering in NYC’s Chinatown” was a “powerful show of defiance of #coronavirus scare,” tweeting four images of large groups of people gathered to celebrate the occasion.

Those tweets are receiving a fresh backlash of criticism given what has unfolded since. Many of the individuals who showed up for the celebrations were Chinese and could have visited China in the weeks before.

Confirmed cases of coronavirus across New York state surged 38 per cent overnight to 20,875 total cases. There have been 157 deaths.

New York is the hardest hit state in the country and New York City accounts for 12,305 confirmed infections.

The advice given by the officials was in line with World Health Organization rhetoric at the time, which discouraged the “stigmatization” of Chinese people.

Once again, it appears that pandering to political correctness almost certainly worsened the spread of coronavirus in New York and could even have led directly to people dying.

As we highlight in the video below, back in February, leftist officials in Italy were also urging citizens to go outside and hug Chinese people in order to fight racism.

Case in point: “Material Girl” singer Madonna, 61, who’s been suffering a public mental breakdown during the coronavirus crisis, put out a bizarre video in which she’s sitting in a bathtub naked praising the coronavirus as the “great equalizer.”

In the video, posted to Twitter Sunday, the “Like a Virgin” vocalist says what’s great about the “no discrimination Covid-19” is that it has “made us all equal in many ways.”

“It’s the great equalizer and what’s terrible about it is what’s great about it,” she says in the video, as ominous music plays in the background.

“What’s terrible about it is that it’s made us all equal in many ways and what’s wonderful about it is that it’s made us all equal in many ways,” she says.

Her tweet was widely mocked on social media, with some accusing her of narcissism.

“You are slowly transforming into a Japanese horror film right before our eyes. I feel like your two videos away from actually becoming the girl in the ring,” one woman commented to Madonna.

In an equally bizarre video, illustrating she’s completely losing it, the singer mocks the coronavirus panic buys with a rendition of her 90s hit “Vogue.”

Madonna cancelled shows earlier this month at the onset of the coronavirus hysteria, along with hundreds of others in the music industry following social distancing guidelines recommended by the CDC.

Case in point: “Material Girl” singer Madonna, 61, who’s been suffering a public mental breakdown during the coronavirus crisis, put out a bizarre video in which she’s sitting in a bathtub naked praising the coronavirus as the “great equalizer.”

In the video, posted to Twitter Sunday, the “Like a Virgin” vocalist says what’s great about the “no discrimination Covid-19” is that it has “made us all equal in many ways.”

“It’s the great equalizer and what’s terrible about it is what’s great about it,” she says in the video, as ominous music plays in the background.

“What’s terrible about it is that it’s made us all equal in many ways and what’s wonderful about it is that it’s made us all equal in many ways,” she says.

Her tweet was widely mocked on social media, with some accusing her of narcissism.

“You are slowly transforming into a Japanese horror film right before our eyes. I feel like your two videos away from actually becoming the girl in the ring,” one woman commented to Madonna.

In an equally bizarre video, illustrating she’s completely losing it, the singer mocks the coronavirus panic buys with a rendition of her 90s hit “Vogue.”

Madonna cancelled shows earlier this month at the onset of the coronavirus hysteria, along with hundreds of others in the music industry following social distancing guidelines recommended by the CDC.

Schwartz, chairman of BLS Investments, recently donated $100,000 to the pro-Biden super PAC Unite the Country. Schwartz donated between $500,000 to $999,999 to the now defunct Biden Foundation, which Biden oversaw during his perfunctory pre-presidential run public speaking period. Biden topped $15 million in income after 2016, according to a 2019 New York Times report. Schwartz was instrumental in pressuring Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to engineer the plot that led to Biden becoming the presumptive nominee instead of insurgent socialist Bernie Sanders.

Biden faces questions about his son Hunter’s partnership with a Chinese government-backed investment firm, which Hunter got involved with less than two weeks after a vice presidential state trip on which he introduced his dad Joe to the eventual Chinese CEO of the firm. That Hunter Biden-partnered investment firm invested in a Chinese nuclear energy company that presents a massive problem for Biden because the American DOJ charged it with espionage in 2016 for stealing secret American nuclear information. Amazing!

Schwartz’s China dealings should also come under scrutiny.

The Phyllis Schlafly Report wrote in 1998:

“In June 1994, the CEO of Loral Space and Communications, Bernard Schwartz, made a $100,000 contribution to the Democratic National Committee. He then joined a Ron Brown trip to China that led to a $250 million telecommunications deal for Loral’s satellites to be launched by Chinese rockets.

In October 1994, Clinton lifted the sanctions he had imposed on China for selling missile technology to Pakistan. In early 1995, Schwartz sent a letter to Clinton urging that responsibility for satellite-export licenses be shifted from the State Department to the Commerce Department. Meanwhile, both Schwartz and Johnny Chung made more huge donations, in excess of $100,000, to the Democratic Party.

On February 6, 1996, despite reports that China continued to export nuclear technology to Pakistan and missiles to Iran, and over the objections of our State and Defense Departments, Clinton signed waivers for four U.S. satellites to be launched by Chinese rockets. On the very same day, Wang Jun (a “Chinese arms dealer”) attended one of Clinton’s now-famous campaign coffees in the White House and spent some time in Ron Brown’s Commerce Department office. Wang Jun owns a huge stake in a Chinese enterprise that benefited from Clinton’s waivers, China International Trade and Investment Corporation.

On Feb. 15, 1996, the Chinese rocket launching a $200-million Loral satellite blew up. Without telling the U.S. Government, Loral scientists prepared a 200-page report advising China how to improve the guidance of its missiles and forwarded this helpful advice to China without Pentagon approval.

The rationale for allowing U.S. satellites to be launched by Chinese rockets is that the technology is safely locked up in a black box, and Americans monitor the launch to assure that it stays secured. But when the Loral rocket blew up, the parts were scattered. The Pentagon refused comment on the Drudge report that the Loral engineers who reviewed the recovered debris said that the encryption hardware was missing.

U.S. intelligence has reported that China has targeted 13 of its 18 CSS-4 long-range missiles against U.S. cities. The CIA says that China’s targeting was made more accurate by Loral’s unauthorized help. The Justice Department started a criminal investigation of Loral, and the State Department warned that Loral’s actions were “criminal, likely to be indicted, knowing and unlawful.”

In March 1996, despite the objections of Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the Defense Department and our intelligence agencies, Clinton personally transferred jurisdiction over satellite-export licensing from the State Department to his pal, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. Meanwhile, Bernard Schwartz stepped up his contributions to the Democratic Party and became the largest single contributor in the 1996 election cycle. Clinton signed another waiver this year to allow Loral Space to export a satellite that is scheduled to be launched by the Chinese in November.

Congress is finally starting to realize that American national security is at stake. On May 20, the House voted 364 to 54 to ban the export of all satellites to China. And, by 417 to 4, the House passed a resolution warning Clinton not to enter into any new agreements with China involving space or missile technology during his forthcoming trip to Beijing. The resolution also rebuked Clinton by declaring that his decision to issue the waiver to Loral Space and Communications earlier this year was “not in the national interest of the United States,” and instructed the President to indefinitely suspend all U.S. satellite exports to China, including a pending Loral deal.

The fact that Clinton personally issued the waivers to allow shipments of U.S. technology that greatly improved the accuracy and reliability of Communist China’s missiles is grounds for impeachment, regardless of whether or not there was any quid pro quo for those decisions. U.S. space technology was just what China needs to make intercontinental ballistic missiles and point them more accurately at U.S. cities. And he did it despite the objections of the U.S. State Department, Defense Department, Justice Department, and intelligence agencies.

Because China shared U.S. technology and equipment with Pakistan, Clinton is also responsible for India starting the nuclear race in Asia. India has fought three wars with its neighbor, Pakistan, since the end of World War II and looks upon Pakistan’s new military capabilities as a direct threat.

Clinton’s policy decisions were, on their face, damaging and dangerous to U.S. national security. And the calendar provides an ominous frame of reference. When Clinton’s policy decisions that dramatically benefited China’s military capability and Loral’s profits, and the hundreds of thousands of dollars of campaign donations from the Chinese government and from Loral, are all placed on the calendar, the sequence shows a pattern of corruption that cannot be ignored. That’s the real campaign finance scandal.”

Discussing the plunging economy as a result of the shutdown of businesses across America during his interview with radio host Alex Jones, Barnes said.

“There’s only one person who is resisting this at any level that can salvage and save us from this, and that’s President Trump,” Barnes told Jones.

“If Trump reverses course within the next 30 days and puts an end to this, then he can save the country and save the economy and save the world,” Barnes said, paralleling the ongoing economic downturn to the great depression.

Going further in a tweet, Barnes vowed to raise a statue to the president in his front yard should he pull the US out of its current economic tailspin.

“If Trump saves us from the Depression everyone else was leading us into by reversing the country’s course on this, I am going to build a statute to him in my front yard (paid for by my successful bets he has won for me),” Barnes said, acknowledging winnings he earned when he bet Trump would win the 2016 general election.

“Robert, we will end up stronger than ever before. Thank you!” the president responded.

Do we really think “it can’t happen here” in America? Could we quarantine the constitution? Are we doing it already?

Panics from pandemics unleash unchecked governmental power. The very premise of popular films like V for Vendetta reveal this: a group uses a virus to seize power and create a totalitarian society. Anyone could witness this from far-off lands, watching the news about China locking people up in their own homes and then removing them screaming from those homes whenever the state wanted. World War I and the Great Depression birthed virulent forms of governments with leaders like Hitler, Mao, Mussolini and Stalin.

The real pandemic threat is here. It’s the panic that will quarantine our Constitution.

First Amendment Quarantined?

Already, governments in America suspended the First Amendment freedom of millions of citizens with shutdown, stay-at-home, curfew orders that prohibit obtaining a petition for a public protest, or even being physically present for a public protest. Indeed, even meetings in “more than ten” are prohibited by various governing jurisdictions within the United States. Surprising places like Missouri did so. Towns like Hartford did so. Maryland soon followed suit. The effect of the stay-at-home orders of New York, California, Nevada, Illinois and Pennsylvania effectively achieve the same outcome. Other governing officials recognized the dubious lawlessness of these orders, but remain outliers. Remember the Hong Kong protests? Gone. Remember the Yellow Vest protests? Soon to be gone. Seen any protests on American streets today? A pandemic is here. Protests gone. Constitution quarantined.

Second Amendment Quarantined?

But that is not all. Under the guise of “unnecessary businesses,” “emergency powers,” or simply by furloughing or reducing staff in the background checks department, governments show the willingness to limit Second Amendment rights as well as First Amendment protections. Mayors declare the right to ban gun sales, governments declare no background-check personnel to process a background check, delaying gun sales indefinitely, and other governments simply shut down all gun sales businesses entirely. Most worrisome, this happens while governments release inmates into the streets, and discuss releasing even more, and, at the same time, issue no-arrest and no-detention orders from Philadelphia to Fort Worth for a wide range of criminals. Want to defend yourself, give yourself a deep sense of personal protection that comes with gun ownership for many, as the Second Amendment safeguards? Well, no luck, according to too many of our governing overlords. A pandemic is here. Self-protection sacrificed. Constitution quarantined.

Fourth Amendment Quarantined?

Few protections are more American than the right to privacy against coerced, compelled, secretive, subversive invasion. The government operates like a virus in a case of a pandemic panic, infecting our minds and bodies, monitoring speech, association and movement, with tools of surveillance unthought-of to the founders. Coordinating with private companies (unrestrained by the Fourth Amendment; why do you think NSA uses them to gather all your emails, conversations, texts, and internet searches, at the first stage?), governments used the panic about the pandemic, a panic the government itself stoked with aid of a compliant, complicit press, to waive your medical privacy and invade your personal privacy, looking for tools to monitor your every movement, associations, activities, and behavior. The watching eye in the sky can now be the Alexa in your home, the camera on your computer, and the phone in your hand. A pandemic is here. Privacy ended. Constitution quarantined.

Fifth Amendment Quarantined?

The protection for our right to make a living arises from the Fifth Amendment right to property without deprivation by due process of law, and the obligation for the government to compensate any such takings. Yet, governments across America did just that to millions of businesses, workers, and property owners, stripping them of their ability to make a living, or even to engage in a free market of commerce, by shutdown orders, curfews, and stay-at-home orders. The political and professional class ensconced in its work-from-home environs fails to appreciate the hardship this imposes on working people. No compensation. No substitution. No wages. No revenues. No opportunity. Labor lost that can never be recovered, ever, while it leaves our economy teetering on the edge of a worst-ever depression. The foundation of government is to protect the pursuit of happiness. Now all we get to pursue is Netflix-and-chill and hope miracles happen to pay next week’s bills, and pray the market doesn’t crash like in 1929. A pandemic is here. Opportunity & property gone. Constitution quarantined.

Conclusion

Our founders were intimately familiar with pandemics, viruses and plagues, yet they did not allow any to suspend our Constitutional liberties. Not one word in the Constitution about plagues or pandemics to exempt the government from any of our Bill of Rights. Why do our current courts allow it? Because the public is asleep at the wheel. Think the pandemic threatens to kills us all? A review of the data shows the pandemic is more panic than plague.

Time to wake up. Maybe it is time in the motto of V for Vendetta, to “Remember, remember the fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot.” As that film’s lead character well said: “People shouldn’t be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people.” Only when an awake public asserts their human liberties to protest the loss of their liberties will, then, governments quit using public health crises to seize power that does not belong to them. The answer to 1984 is still 1776.

Follow him on Twitter @Barnes_Law

Do we really think “it can’t happen here” in America? Could we quarantine the constitution? Are we doing it already?

Panics from pandemics unleash unchecked governmental power. The very premise of popular films like V for Vendetta reveal this: a group uses a virus to seize power and create a totalitarian society. Anyone could witness this from far-off lands, watching the news about China locking people up in their own homes and then removing them screaming from those homes whenever the state wanted. World War I and the Great Depression birthed virulent forms of governments with leaders like Hitler, Mao, Mussolini and Stalin.

The real pandemic threat is here. It’s the panic that will quarantine our Constitution.

First Amendment Quarantined?

Already, governments in America suspended the First Amendment freedom of millions of citizens with shutdown, stay-at-home, curfew orders that prohibit obtaining a petition for a public protest, or even being physically present for a public protest. Indeed, even meetings in “more than ten” are prohibited by various governing jurisdictions within the United States. Surprising places like Missouri did so. Towns like Hartford did so. Maryland soon followed suit. The effect of the stay-at-home orders of New York, California, Nevada, Illinois and Pennsylvania effectively achieve the same outcome. Other governing officials recognized the dubious lawlessness of these orders, but remain outliers. Remember the Hong Kong protests? Gone. Remember the Yellow Vest protests? Soon to be gone. Seen any protests on American streets today? A pandemic is here. Protests gone. Constitution quarantined.

https://www.infowars.com/,https://www.infowars.com/ron-paul-like-freedom-then-you-wont-like-the-freedom-act/,2020-03-23T11:02:26-05:00,Ron Paul: Like Freedom? Then You Won’t Like the FREEDOM Act,"Last Monday, a bipartisan group of Senators and a coalition including libertarian and progressive activists thwarted a scheme to ram through the Senate legislation renewing three provisions of the USA FREEDOM Act (previously known as the USA PATRIOT Act). The bill had already been rushed through the House of Representatives, and most expected it to sail through the Senate. But, instead, Senate leadership had to settle for a 77-day extension.

Senate leadership was also forced to allow consideration of several amendments at a later date. Included is Sen. Rand Paul’s amendment that would forbid the FISA court from issuing warrants targeting American citizens.

Deep state supporters claim the expiring business records provision (which authorizes the collection of our communications and was at the center of Edward Snowden’s 2013 revelations), lone wolf provision (which allows government to subject an individual with no known ties to terrorists to warrantless surveillance), and roving wiretaps provision (which allows government to monitor communications on any device that may be used by a targeted individual) are necessary to keep Americans safe. But, since Congress first passed the PATRIOT Act almost 20 years ago, mass surveillance, warrantless wiretapping, and bulk data collection have not stopped a single terrorist attack.

The legislation does have “reforms” aimed at protecting civil liberties, but these new protections contain loopholes that render the protections meaningless. For example, the bill requires those targeted for surveillance to be notified that the government spied on them. However, this requirement can be waived if the government simply claims — not proves but just claims — that notifying the target would harm “national security.”

The notice provision also only applies to the target of an investigation. So, if you were caught up in a federal investigation because a coworker is being targeted and you shared an office computer, or if a store clerk reported to the government you and others bought pressure cookers, the government could collect your phone records, texts, and social media posts without giving you the chance to challenge the government’s actions.

The bill also makes some reforms to the special FISA court, which serves as a rubber stamp for the intelligence community. These reforms are mainly aimed at protecting political campaigns and candidates. They would not stop the FISA court from rubber-stamping surveillance on organizations that oppose the welfare-warfare-surveillance-fiat money status quo.

Anything limiting warrantless wiretapping and mass surveillance should be supported. However, nothing short of repeal of the USA FREEDOM Act will restore respect for our right to live our lives free of the fear that Big Brother is watching. The path to liberty, peace, and prosperity starts with eliminating all unconstitutional laws and returning to a system of limited government, free markets, individual liberty, sound money, and a foreign policy that seeks peaceful commerce and friendship with all instead of seeking new monsters to destroy.

The president has already considered reopening the country after the 15-day waiting period he put in place to try to slow down the spread of coronavirus, according to media reports.

“The president started talking about how to get people back to work around Thursday, two of the people said, only three days after he helped roll out a 15-day plan from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stem the rise of cases by encouraging most people to stay at home. That campaign would end about March 31,” reported Newsmax. “The discussions centered on what to do after the 15-day period ends, and how to test and isolate everyone who’s sick so healthy people can return to work. It’s likely the CDC guidelines would be relaxed rather than scrapped altogether, one person said.”

The president is now facing a dilemma in which further lockdowns in response to the coronavirus would lead to a recession as bad as – if not worse than – the 2008 Great Recession, especially given how many Americans are heavily in consumer debt and are thus living paycheck-to-paycheck.

According to libertarian commentator Kristin Tate:

Financial planners suggest saving at least 20 percent of take home income, while spending at most 30 percent on discretionary items. Yet too many workers still fail to think twice about spending entire paychecks for things they want but do not need.

Recent decades have offered us relative luxury. More than 80 percent of Americans own smartphones. The same portion of households own one high definition flat screen television, while over half of households own more than one. Over 60 percent of Americans dine out at least once a week, while nearly 20 percent dine out three or more times a week.

It’s a brewing economic crisis that President Trump has already publicly lamented on, and his response to a tweet by constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes reveals the president is getting more hesitant about lockdowns, martial law and other escalating government responses to the coronavirus which would derail the economy for years.

Aside from exemptions for people from France, Luxembourg, and Switzerland who are providing essential services, German authorities closed the country’s border to all foreign citizens last week.

However, according to the German Ministry of the Interior, so-called “asylum seekers,” a catch-all term that basically describes economic migrants fleeing from the Middle East and Africa, are still welcome.

“At Germany’s EU external borders [airports and seaports], there has been no change in the [asylum] procedure,” a representative of the Ministry of the Interior told Junge Freiheit.

This means that Europeans who previously had a right to enter Germany are being treated as second class citizens compared to migrants from the third world, who merely have to utter the word “asylum” to enter Germany and have their case heard, even in the midst of a deadly global pandemic.

“In practice, this means that if a migrant were to illegally enter the European Union’s Schengen Zone via Italy or Greece and make it to France or Switzerland, he can still demand asylum in Germany, and thus must be allowed to traverse these countries so that he can formally request it on German territory,” reports Voice of Europe.

The situation is similar in Sweden, where asylum seekers will continue to be processed and allowed to stay in the country despite a global pandemic.

Given that migrants already in Germany rioted and displayed ISIS flags when told their refugee camp had to be put in quarantine, one wonders whether newly arrived asylum seekers will obey lockdown rules.

As Breitbart highlights, attempts to enforce a quarantine in migrant-heavy areas of Paris are proving “impossible” because migrants just ignore the law and congregate in large crowds if confronted by police. Authorities cannot hand out fines to migrants due to fears of a violent “backlash.”

An Ipsos survey released last week showed that a majority of people in 12 different countries supported closing the borders until the coronavirus outbreak is contained.

He expects to be back in the Senate after his quarantine period ends and will continue to work for the people of Kentucky at this difficult time. Ten days ago, our D.C. office began operating remotely, hence virtually no staff has had contact with Senator Rand Paul. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 22, 2020

Almost immediately the fake news that Paul had infected the Senate began to spread. A CNN reporter and Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema seem to have been the primary sources:

All of a sudden about three weeks back, Italy saw a sudden surge in cases that took it from just a handful to a serious outbreak in Lombardy, then across northern and central Italy, then finally into the Italian south.

And after cases seemed to hit a blow-off top over the last two weeks after a streak of grim consecutive numbers where Italy was reporting nearly 1,000 deaths a day, those numbers are finally coming down.

According to health officials, the number of new deaths reported on Monday dropped to 601, down from 655. The number of new cases climbed to 63,927, from 59,138, while the Italian death toll hit 6,078. Total cases stand just shy of 64,000 one day after the Italian government went “full Wuhan” and decided to shut down industrial production across the country to try and force wider compliance with its social distancing recommendations.

More encouraging videos are going viral as Italians rally their spirits to confront the virus. One video of opera singers entertaining a neighborhood caught the world’s attention on Twitter.

Meanwhile, the Italian government thanked the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin for 9 plane loads of aid that were delivered to the country.

Italians are a notoriously spicy people. In keeping with that reputation, a video of small town mayors threatening individuals who knowingly violate the government quarantine measures.

Though these last two days have brought reason for cautious optimism, the situation in Italy remains unquestionably dire: The mortality rate in the country is significantly higher than anywhere else in the developed world. Despite a series of near-draconian measures gradually rolled out to halt the spread of the virus, including a nationwide lockdown and the shutdown all non-essential businesses, Italy has been unable to “flatten the curve,” as US officials put it. The country’s mortality rate is a world-leading 9.4% as of Monday. China, in contrast, reported a 3.4% though its stats are in doubt.

Hopefully for the country’s sake, the slowdown continues, and not just because the Italian government is preparing to tweak the stats to try and make the numbers look slightly less grim.

The volume of outstanding corporate debt issued by companies across the region has doubled since the 2008 financial crisis to $32 trillion as of last year, Moody’s says.

“It’s a little bit crazy out there and there are very few sectors that are protected from this,” said John Park, a Brisbane-based managing director at restructuring firm FTI Consulting as cited by the Financial Times. “We are seeing an immediate uptick in inquiries from firms seeking advice on how to prevent a potential insolvency event.”

China’s property market is of a particular concern, analysts say. According to Dealogic data, as of February the industry owed a total of $647 billion in bonds denominated in local and hard currencies. Statistics showed that sales and construction starts both plunged more than 20 percent in the first two months, compared to a year ago.

“It appears inevitable that the current level of operational disruption, if unabated, will feed through into higher volumes of covenant breaches, and potentially defaults,” said James Dilley, deals advisory partner at PwC, the professional services firm in Hong Kong. He was referring to China’s property market.

The pandemic has also caused a funding squeeze in Thailand and risks to banks in Vietnam, while in Australia it has prompted a scramble by some companies to raise equity, as they struggle with debt repayments.

Meanwhile, some investors are trying to delve into the debt rubble for opportunities. “Our trading volume has grown exponentially in March compared to last year,” said Michel Lowy, head of Hong Kong-based credit investment group SC Lowy.

“The opportunity for business like ours is to try to figure out corporates that are well-positioned from a liquidity standpoint and will have the ability to weather the storm,” he added.

According to Hamish Douglass, chairman and co-founder of Sydney-based fund manager Magellan Financial Group, the coronavirus shutdown would be fatal for many debt-laden companies. He told clients this week that governments could follow the example of New Zealand, which on Friday bailed out the country’s national airline with a NZ$900 million (US$525 million) loan. “Only governments can prevent these businesses from failing,” Douglass was quoted as saying by the FT.

“The outlook for global growth: for 2020 it is negative – a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse. But we expect recovery in 2021,” the IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said, following a conference call of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors.

The IMF further warned that many emerging markets could be particularly severely hit by the economic downturn, and advocated “extraordinary fiscal actions” and measures to ease monetary policy.

Still, according to the organization, the recovery from a looming economic disaster could start as early as 2021.

“The economic impact is and will be severe, but the faster the virus stops, the quicker and stronger the recovery will be,” the IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement.

For its part, the IMF said it plans to “massively step up emergency finance” and stands “ready to deploy all our $1 trillion lending capacity” with particular focus on the poorest countries. Georgieva noted that almost 80 states had already requested IMF assistance.

The 2008 global financial crisis and the recession that followed, spreading into 2009 has so far been considered as the most severe worldwide economic disaster in the modern history. Some economists labelled it the most serious crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Started as a mortgage market crisis in the US, it soon developed in to an international banking crisis followed by a severe debt crisis in the EU, leading to strict austerity measures for such countries as Italy and Greece. Now, Italy is one of the nations most severely affected by the novel coronavirus. Brussels already allowed Rome to disregard the EU stability and growth pact regulating budgetary policy to fight the disease outbreak.

The 2008 global financial crisis and the recession that followed, spreading into 2009 has so far been considered as the most severe worldwide economic disaster in the modern history. Some economists labelled it the most serious crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Started as a mortgage market crisis in the US, it soon developed in to an international banking crisis followed by a severe debt crisis in the EU, leading to strict austerity measures for such countries as Italy and Greece. Now, Italy is one of the nations most severely affected by the novel coronavirus. Brussels already allowed Rome to disregard the EU stability and growth pact regulating budgetary policy to fight the disease outbreak.

Yes, the private jet industry – which is run by, and caters almost exclusively to the wealthy – has been the latest pig to line up at the government trough for their share of freshly printed Venezuelan Bolivars U.S. dollars.

The National Business Aviation Association, which represents private jet companies and corporate jets, sent a letter to congressional leaders saying the industry is facing “increasing financial uncertainty” and that it should be bailed out, according to CNBC.

The letter stated: “Due to the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is currently no certainty as to when economic conditions will improve, which threatens the survival and prospects of thousands of general aviation businesses.”

The NBAA claims that private jets support 1.2 million jobs and $247 billion in “economic impact”, whatever the hell that means.

All the while, business has been booming for these carriers. According to CNBC:

– Magellan Jets, a private jet charter company, said trip volume was up 70% in the first two weeks of March

– VistaJet said flights are up 16% since the beginning of the year

– PrivateFly touted the attraction of flying private during a health crisis and said revenues would be up

– Wheels Up said that it is “prepared and have availability to service the uptick in demand we are seeing from individual and corporate members.”

The question then becomes: how do you sell a bailout of this industry to mom and pop on Main Street? The bailout of commercial airlines is being sold as a benefit to the public, once society restarts. But why do the rich – and those flying them around the world – need taxpayer money?

Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic Policy said: “It’s hard to imagine anything worse. Putting up public money to support an industry that serves the rich would be hard to justify. It’s absurd.”

https://www.infowars.com/,https://www.infowars.com/why-we-need-free-markets-to-fight-pandemics/,2020-03-23T10:36:27-05:00,Why We Need Free Markets To Fight Pandemics,"The natural response in the face of a pandemic like the one we are experiencing today with COVID-19 is to take immediate and direct action to curb the crisis.

We are told we need to have extensive quarantines, citywide lockdowns, and shelter-in-place orders. We supposedly need to limit the number of goods people can buy so they don’t hoard them up, and definitely keep prices where they are at so people can afford to get what they need. Hospitals and clinics must cancel surgeries and new treatment plans to ensure that they are prepared for the waves of patients catching the illness. Restaurants need to switch to takeout models! Stores need to switch to online-only, close their retail establishments, and prioritize important shipments! Government needs to make sure everyone does what they should to ensure we all make it out alive!

But what if I told you that none of that was true? What if I told you that all you need in this situation is what you need every day in a free society: prices that can rapidly and easily adjust to changes in supply and demand?

I can almost hear teeth grinding and fists shaking in response, with exclamations that I must not care about my fellow man. But hear me out as I walk through the effects that such prices would have.

Let’s start with what has occurred so far. People have flooded grocery stores to stock up on everything from canned goods to toilet paper, emptying the shelves in the process. Hospitals and clinics have, “in line with CDC guidance” (this phrase is ubiquitous), canceled various appointments and planned treatments or surgeries. Amazon has limited third-party shipments to its warehouses to “high-demand” items. Increased remote work has crashed remote coordination services. Governments everywhere have engaged in various levels of forced quarantining and shut down numerous businesses or ordinary ways of doing business.

None of these effects or approaches of mitigation and avoidance are a problem per se. Much of this would naturally be done in response to a pandemic and the effects on demand would be similar. But what can be said is that such measures are taken crudely and mostly blindly in the absence of free prices.

The empty shelves would not be so prevalent were prices allowed to rise in contradiction of governmental laws against “price gouging.” Such a result would lead to natural rationing by consumers and would incentivize the ramp-up of production of goods in high demand. At current prices, it is true that some companies could potentially bear a short-term loss to increase production as a charitable endeavor. However, marginal producers (and even nonmarginal ones as the crisis continues) will only be able to ramp up production, even temporarily, if the prices rise.

A rise in prices informs producers of shifts in relative demand. That hypothetically the price of milk does not rise as much as the price of eggs or canned beans is a vitally important piece of information that cannot be conveyed through empty shelves alone. Rising prices would induce makers of the latter goods to expand production much more than producers of the former, and they would also encourage new entrants to prioritize accordingly.

We can observe the same mechanism at work in price drops, which are normally allowed to happen. The decreased demand for certain goods, such as tickets to events, flights, or crowded dine-in restaurants, signals these industries to find alternatives. These may include restaurants shifting to a takeout model, closing their main dining areas for the duration of the crisis, as has occurred in some places, or turning those dining areas into temporary warehouses for needed items (though this option seems foreclosed due to frozen prices disincentivizing the additional production that would make this helpful). Firms may also temporarily shutter their doors and send their workers into the labor force as potential temporary employees in areas that need them to produce vital necessities. (Instead, the government approach has been to propose bailouts and universal income checks while in some cases mandating the clear waste of resources.)

Price changes also differ by location, which naturally encourages the market to focus on the hardest-hit areas. A pandemic will not hit the entire country all at once, and although it may seem obvious (particularly at first) which areas are the worst off, the information that prices convey is vital to determining what the actual needs are. It may be that Seattle and New York City are the worst hit right now, but that alone does not tell you that Seattle is really needing ventilators while New York is short on nurses.

Allowing prices to work in healthcare is of the most vital necessity. Rather than the crude strategy of canceling care not considered “urgent” while stockpiling resources in preparation for the worst, it is better to allow resources to be directed to where they are most needed via the price mechanism. Regulations restricting the supply of care, including the construction of new facilities, the licensing of existing ones, and the number of people allowed to be licensed should be suspended (or, better, repealed). High prices for care, particularly for specialized laborers such as doctors and nurses, would invite the sector to expand its capacity by accepting med school trainees or professionals with lapsed licenses as temporary employees. High prices for emergency coronavirus care, particularly if permitted to be higher in the worst-off regions, would induce medical professionals to temporarily switch specialization and move to areas where they can do the most good. People taken in from shuttered businesses might be able to provide basic care and monitoring with minimal training, allowing those with more specialized training to prioritize the care that needs it most.

Insurance companies facing these high emergency costs would be heavily incentivized to come up with additional ways to mitigate the risk of spreading the illness. Tests that people could take at home and drop off at collection points, for instance, might allow for testing to be done without queues of potentially sick people that will almost certainly be sick when they get done. Even payments (and possibly delivery of necessities) to at-risk patients to incentivize a self-quarantine would be possible. And, most importantly, there are likely very many other possibilities that I, as a single person, have not and might not even be able to come up with. This kind of innovation and adaptation can only be optimally handled by entrepreneurs responding to changing prices, not central planners, no matter how intelligent, knowledgeable, or well intentioned.

The free market price system allows for the rapid and intensive reallocation of resources that is necessary in a crisis scenario like a pandemic. What needs to be done in such a crisis is not to attempt to steer the market to ensure that it provides what is needed (this approach is almost guaranteed to make the situation worse than it has to be), but to let it free to do what it always does: match the goals of entrepreneurial producers with the needs of the populace.

The SARS CoV2 virus that is behind the COVID-19 pandemic has finally ravaged the United States, and cities and states are reacting to its brutality by shutting stuff down. As the United States continues to increase measures to isolate the sick and slow the spread, the oil industry is bracing for harder times ahead. Just how bad could it get, and what would a full quarantine mean for US oil?

The effects of US border closures, travel restrictions, school shutdowns, bar and restaurant dining-in shutdown are already hitting the US oil industry hard.

The primary US oil benchmark – West Texas Intermediate, has fallen by about $30 per barrel over the last month, making it difficult or impossible, rather for US oil producers to turn a profit.

The breakeven for most US producers is above the current $22.61 as of 8:15 am EDT.

And while the profit crunch will no doubt cripple smaller producers and oilfield service providers that don’t have their hands in other ventures, the industry is facing even more challenges due to the virus.

Oil Demand Set to Crash

While Saudi Arabia and Russia gear up to flood the world with crude oil, demand for oil is falling off sharply. At first, the world was freaking out about a slowdown in oil demand growth. Those concerns seem paltry now. Today, we’re talking about a straight-up slump in oil demand.

Travel bans and government directives that have shut down everything, and businesses that are self-directing full shutdowns including the shutdown of US automakers and encouraged people to stay at home are already taking a big bite out of oil demand in the US.

A full quarantine would be even more devastating.

The United States is the largest consumer of crude oil in the world, consuming 19.96 million bpd – or 20 percent of the world’s total, and the transportation sector is the backbone of this demand, accounting for 9.329 million bpd of all petroleum products consumed in the US in 2018, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Distillates, too, are comprised of some transportation-sector demand in the form of diesel.

While some sky-is-falling analysts and wishful-thinking environmentalists have long predicted that demand for crude oil will peak within the next few years due to the rise of the EVs, COVID-19 is proving a far more worthy and immediate foe.

The oil market is already melting down on coronavirus fears, and only a handful of cities and counties – including the Bay Area in California (pop. 7 million), San Miguel County in Colorado (pop. 8,000),

Starting Thursday, Fresno (pop. 530,000) a shelter-in-place order will go into effect, and starting Friday, additional shelter-in-place measures will be implemented in Oak Park in Illinois (pop. 52,200).

While certainly disruptive to the transportation sector, these shelter in place orders are just a small portion of what a national shelter-in-place order would be, which would restrict the movements of 329 million people.

Of course, even a full-scale shelter-in-place order wouldn’t see demand from the transportation sector fall to zero – some forms of public transportation would still run, critical infrastructure workers would still be moving to and fro and emergency services would still be in full swing. But even a 50 percent reduction in transportation-related oil demand would see about 5 million bpd stripped away from the total oil consumption in the US.

The slackening demand caused by such a drastic, if not necessary, action would result in a surplus of oil to the tune of 35 million barrels per week unless production dropped to match – and it eventually would.

For perspective, weekly API- and EIA-reported crude inventory moves in the United States rarely lose or gain more than 9 million barrels.

Already the low price situation, stemming from the imaginings of panicked traders as well as the reality of growing supplies and shrinking demand, oil majors are scrambling to find places to store crude oil. Last week, Shell was looking to charter three VLCCs to store crude oil in anticipation of the deluge of oil that Saudi Arabia was planning to export.

But storage space is finite.

FitchRatings, which updated its price forecasts on Thursday for oil, “in expectation of very large market oversupply in 2020.”

According to Bjornar Tonhaguen of Rystad Energy, “the market will soon come to realize that it may be facing one of the largest supply surpluses in modern oil market history in April.”

And if the tight crude oil storage isn’t enough of an issue, oil majors are also looking to store jet fuel at sea – a far trickier endeavor than storing crude oil due to its more delicate nature.

On Thursday, the US is expected to announce even greater travel restrictions – urging US citizens not to travel abroad – a level 4 travel advisory. This will further dent oil demand and is another step closer to a full lockdown.

The US government is also said to have created a 100-page report outlining its plan to prepare for the coronavirus situation to last 18 months. If this preparedness turns out to be on point, it, too, will cripple oil demand in the United States.

Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are down around three percent. The Nasdaq Composite, an index comprised of America’s top technology companies, is down slightly in early trading.

Global markets are down despite the promise by the US Federal Reserve to pump in the cash “amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy.”

The US regulator has warned that the country’s economy faces major trouble as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, and has pledged to take measures to minimize its impact.

The Fed has promised to unveil a direct lending program for small- and medium-sized American businesses, which are projected to be hardest hit by the pandemic. In addition, the Fed will also help students with their education loans.

“While the Fed’s actions are an enormous help, the only way the markets are going to find sustainable improvement is when the economy is allowed to come back to life, or at least there is a real path in place for how that is going to happen,” said Paul Hickey of Bespoke Investment Group, in a note seen by CNBC.

More bad news for the markets came from Washington as a fiscal stimulus bill failed a key procedural Senate vote on Sunday as Democrats warned the measure was not enough to help workers and was too focused on bailing out companies. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier pointed out she was not on board with the Republican-version of the stimulus plan, saying: “From my standpoint, we’re apart.”

According to the US National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, the economic stimulus package will total more than $2 trillion and will be equal to roughly ten percent of US economic output.

Last week, US President Donald Trump signed a $100 billion bill that expanded paid leave in the country.

“While the Fed’s actions are an enormous help, the only way the markets are going to find sustainable improvement is when the economy is allowed to come back to life, or at least there is a real path in place for how that is going to happen,” said Paul Hickey of Bespoke Investment Group, in a note seen by CNBC.

More bad news for the markets came from Washington as a fiscal stimulus bill failed a key procedural Senate vote on Sunday as Democrats warned the measure was not enough to help workers and was too focused on bailing out companies. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier pointed out she was not on board with the Republican-version of the stimulus plan, saying: “From my standpoint, we’re apart.”

According to the US National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, the economic stimulus package will total more than $2 trillion and will be equal to roughly ten percent of US economic output.

Last week, US President Donald Trump signed a $100 billion bill that expanded paid leave in the country.

“If this pandemic continues at the scale and scope of what some are predicting, over time you could start seeing an impact on [military] readiness,” said Esper, though he added he does not foresee the military being affected enough for it to be incapable of conducting “national missions.”

Part of the US military’s responsibilities during the pandemic will be setting up field hospitals in cities like New York and Seattle, Esper revealed.

The secretary says he’s waiting on approval from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to move forward with the plan. “We’ll be moving out this week,” he told reporters.

The military is already on the ground in cities like New York to help expand hospital capacity as the outbreak worsens in the US. Esper admitted, however, that the Pentagon “can’t meet everyone’s needs” when it comes to states requesting help. All requests go through FEMA, where they are classified according to priority.

Deployment of National Guard soldiers in certain states have already prompted concerns of an impending announcement of martial law.

The Maryland National Guard had to officially announce there was “no threat of martial law” over the weekend to help calm the fears of residents alarmed by the sight of military vehicles moving through their streets, as well as reports that the Pentagon is mulling the military taking a larger role in the coronavirus response.

The spread of Covid-19 has already lowered staff actually serving in the Pentagon by about 60 percent. Esper says thousands of tests are done each day to check US service members for the disease, with multiple labs specifically designated to conduct the tests.

The disease has impacted on the US military’s overseas missions. Bases in South Korea have been put on lockdown and US participation in major international war games like NATO’s ‘Defender Europe 2020’ have been halted. Some 20,000 American troops were expected to take part in the drill, but were kept home or returned to the US.

The US Defense Department revealed earlier on Monday that 133 soldiers have contracted coronavirus, which is a large uptick from the 67 reported on Friday to have contracted the disease. Seven soldiers remain hospitalized, while four have recovered.

Federal health officials could use this data as a means of syndromic surveillance.

According to the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA), “syndromic surveillance refers to methods relying on detection of individual and population health indicators that are discernible before confirmed diagnoses are made.”

The collection of data for the purpose of monitoring the spread of the coronavirus in response to this public heath emergency.

“In particular, prior to the laboratory confirmation of an infectious disease, ill persons may exhibit behavioral patterns, symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings that can be tracked through a variety of data sources. ”

The effort to monitor social distancing with data collection is reported by some sources to be anonymized. The government wouldn’t have specific individual information, and users will be required to opt-in to this agreement to be monitored.

“The White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are asking Facebook, Google and other tech giants to give them greater access to Americans’ smartphone location data in order to help them combat the spread of the coronavirus, according to four people at companies involved in the discussions who are not authorized to speak about them publicly,” reported by NBC News.

“Federal health officials say they could use anonymous, aggregated user data collected by the tech companies to map the spread of the virus — a practice known as “syndromic surveillance” — and prevent further infections. They could also use the data to see whether people were practicing “social distancing.”

As this is a push from the Federal Government to control the spread of a major heath emergency, big tech giants are challenged to break privacy rights for their users. Others worry that granting permissions to the White House for this purpose will allow further more violating invasions of privacy down the line.

Although all spokespeople have declined comment to the press, The White House and many federal health officials participated in a call with big tech companies Facebook, Google, Amazon, IBM, Apple Microsoft, and Cisco."

The Imperial College London modeling also became the basis for the 100 page “U.S. Government COVID-19 Response Plan.”

The Imperial College London model is woefully inadequate. It does not model increased use of personal protective equipment in the general public such as face masks. It does not model medical interventions that have shown promise in reducing fatalities including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin, and intravenous L-ascorbic acid. And the Imperial College London model does not take into account “deaths of despair” from a sharp rise in unemployment that will be triggered by sheltering in place for weeks, months, or years (the “U.S. Government COVID-19 Response Plan” estimates that the “pandemic will last 18 months or longer”).

The social determinants of health

There is a large volume of academic literature on “the social determinants of health” and “deaths of despair” caused by increases in the unemployment rate. The pioneering work in this field was conducted by Harvey Brenner (then at Johns Hopkins University) on behalf of the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress in the mid 1970s. Reviewing U.S. historical data over the period 1940 to 1973, Brenner found that:

…a 1% increase in the unemployment rate sustained over a period of six years has been associated (during the past three decades) with increases of 36,887 total deaths, including 20,240 cardiovascular deaths, 920 suicides, 648 homicides, 495 deaths from cirrhosis of the liver, 4,227 state mental hospital admissions, and 3,340 state prison admission.

Brenner’s estimates held up in subsequent studies of England & Wales, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. It should be noted that there is also a large volume of literature that is critical of the Brenner model (see e.g. Cohen & Felson, 1979).

Brenner’s estimates are based on population figures from 1970. According to the U.S. Census bureau, the U.S. population was 205.1 million in 1970 and 327.2 million in 2018 — an increase in the population of 59.5%. So the actual increase in mortality caused by a 1% increase in the unemployment rate today (if it persisted for five years) might be closer to 58,834 lives lost. A more recent meta analysis of 42 studies conducted in 15 countries on the relationship between unemployment and all-cause mortality found that unemployment increased the risk of dying by 63% (Roelfs et al. 2011).

So how many additional deaths will be caused in the U.S. by the increase in the unemployment rate caused by government orders to shelter in place? That depends on a lot of factors including the number unemployed and the length of unemployment. The official unemployment rate in February 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics was 3.5%. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin warned lawmakers of the possibility of a 20% unemployment rate from coronavirus shutdowns unless Congress passes a $1 trillion stimulus plan (although he walked the statement back the next day). New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota all report 10- to 12-fold increases in the filing of unemployment claims last week.

The coronavirus economic crash

Two-thirds of the U.S. economy depends on consumer spending. With many states and cities moving towards various forms of lockdown, extreme social distancing, and sheltering in place (terms that were unheard of even a week ago) it is unclear whether even a massive federal stimulus will be enough to reduce the surge in unemployment that has already started in the United States.

The 2008 financial collapse shows that once the economy slows to a standstill, it takes years to bring it back up to full speed again. A study by Schularick & Taylor (2012) of recessions in 14 countries over the period 1870–2008 shows that it takes two years for a country to recover from a normal recession whereas it took 10 years to recover from the Great Depression. While a recession seems highly likely at this point, it is anyone’s guess how long it will last.

Let’s examine 3 scenarios: lower bound, mid-range, and upper bound. Following the Brenner (1976) model, these figures all reflect the estimated cumulative impact of an increase in unemployment on mortality over a five-year lag period.

Lower bound. If the unemployment rate increases by 5 points as a result of the various lockdowns, then 294,170 additional lives will be lost, not from coronavirus, but from deaths of despair.

Mid-range. If the unemployment rate increases by 16.5 points (as predicted by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin), then 970,761 additional lives will be lost to deaths of despair.

Upper bound. And if the unemployment rate increases by 10-fold — which is what we are already seeing in several states — then 1,853,271 lives will be lost to deaths of despair from government orders to lock down, shut down, and shelter in place.

The magnitude of the association between unemployment and mortality is higher for men than women and higher in early career and middle career workers than older workers (Roelfs et al., 2011, p. 849). It seems reasonable to assume that the coronavirus economic crash will also disproportionately impact the poor and working classes who lack sizable financial reserves.

A wide range of authors are now raising questions about the advisability of widespread lockdowns of indeterminate length (see: Editorial Board of the Wall Street Journal, David L. Katz, Thomas Friedman, Russell Berman, and Romer & Garber).

If government wants to minimize total fatalities from this crisis it must do better modeling. Greater use of personal protective equipment and improved medical interventions will bend the curve and should be acted upon immediately. Deaths of despair must be modeled along with deaths from coronavirus based on realistic, verifiable, independent data on prevalence and mortality rates. As it stands right now, deaths of despair from crashing the economy via lockdowns will significantly add to the final death toll and may end up surpassing fatalities from the virus itself.



In the wake of the coronavirus hysteria, total suspension of individual freedom hangs in the balance.

French residents are now required to produce a government form stating their purpose for travel any time they are outside of their homes, as Infowars Europe has reported.

In Cagnes-sur-Mer, a driver allegedly refused to comply with police orders at a mandatory checkpoint and attempted to flee in a reckless manner that endangered the life of an officer, who ultimately responded with deadly force.

“During the check, the driver stopped, had a brief exchange with a police officer before suddenly driving towards a police officer, according to a witness and the victim themself,” local prosecutor Fabienne Atzori told Ouest France.

“According to the witness, the policeman’s life was at risk.”

The officer fired shots at the vehicle, but the driver fled the scene and was still at large on Monday.

The driver is now wanted for “refusal to comply and committing intentional violence with a weapon against a person holding public authority.""

Multiple travelers are also facing penalties for refusing to comply at checkpoints.

“Since this Saturday, we have had an increase in inappropriate behavior during controls,” said Atzori.

“They're not all as serious, but they do show that some people are showing firm opposition to these types of checks.”

Aside from exemptions for people from France, Luxembourg, and Switzerland who are providing essential services, German authorities closed the country’s border to all foreign citizens last week.

However, according to the German Ministry of the Interior, so-called “asylum seekers,” a catch-all term that basically describes economic migrants fleeing from the Middle East and Africa, are still welcome.

“At Germany’s EU external borders [airports and seaports], there has been no change in the [asylum] procedure,” a representative of the Ministry of the Interior told Junge Freiheit.

This means that Europeans who previously had a right to enter Germany are being treated as second class citizens compared to migrants from the third world, who merely have to utter the word “asylum” to enter Germany and have their case heard, even in the midst of a deadly global pandemic.

“In practice, this means that if a migrant were to illegally enter the European Union’s Schengen Zone via Italy or Greece and make it to France or Switzerland, he can still demand asylum in Germany, and thus must be allowed to traverse these countries so that he can formally request it on German territory,” reports Voice of Europe.

The situation is similar in Sweden, where asylum seekers will continue to be processed and allowed to stay in the country despite a global pandemic.

Given that migrants already in Germany rioted and displayed ISIS flags when told their refugee camp had to be put in quarantine, one wonders whether newly arrived asylum seekers will obey lockdown rules.

As Breitbart highlights, attempts to enforce a quarantine in migrant-heavy areas of Paris are proving “impossible” because migrants just ignore the law and congregate in large crowds if confronted by police. Authorities cannot hand out fines to migrants due to fears of a violent “backlash.”

An Ipsos survey released last week showed that a majority of people in 12 different countries supported closing the borders until the coronavirus outbreak is contained.

Among the evidence is an interview with an ex-health minister, who called government action a masquerade.

Three French medics filed a legal complaint this week against Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and former minister of solidarity and health, Agnes Buzyn.

The two senior officials, the complaint alleges, failed to perform their duty and organize a proper response to the coronavirus outbreak, which by now has gripped most of Europe and put France on standstill.

As early as January, the two ministers were aware of the threat posed by the virus, but ""chose not to act,"" according to the complaint filed with France's CJR, a court established to try cases of ministerial misconduct.

If convicted, the accused could land in prison for up to two years and face heavy fines.

“At some point the truth needs to be told, which is that these people have been lying to us from the start,"" Fabrice di Vizio, the lawyer representing the three plaintiffs, told RT.

Among the evidence cited in the legal papers is an interview that Buzyn gave to newspaper Le Monde, in which she expressed regret about leaving her ministerial office and running for mayor of Paris for President Emmanuel Macron's La Republique en Marche (LRM) party.

She said she was crying as she left the ministry ""because I knew there was a tsunami coming.""

The minister was called to participate in the race after LRM's first-choice candidate dropped out in mid-February over a sexting scandal. She took third place in the first round of the municipal election last Sunday and has withdrawn from the election.

""We should have stopped [the election]; it was a masquerade,"" the ex-minister said. She added on January 30 that she suggested canceling the municipal election, but Prime Minister Philippe chose not to.

The French government denies any negligence and said it was paying close attention to Covid-19, but the scientific data did not warrant taking stronger measures in February.

Buzyn said she should not have used the word ""masquerade"" in the interview, explaining that she was under much stress at the time, and has endorsed the government's handling of the health crisis.

Di Vizio, the medic's lawyer, believes the government is still more interested in scoring political points than saving lives.

""Last week the government spoke about the masks. You remember those pompous speeches by the president, who was all commander-in-chief in tone and promised the masks?"" he told RT.

""Masks are a primary tool of war since they protect the health workers. Have those masks arrived?""

Mask shortages have become an acute problem in France, with the government ordering 250 million pieces of the equipment on Saturday.

Professor of Virology and Microbiology at the University of Padova Dr. Giorgio Palù told CNN that measures imposing travel restrictions and border controls were taken too late due to fears over political correctness.

“There was a proposal to isolate people coming from the epicenter, coming from China,” Palù told CNN. “Then it became seen as racist, but they were people coming from the outbreak.”

Italy is now the hardest hit country in the world in terms of coronavirus deaths, with 3,405 people losing their lives.

The need to minimize potential “racism” and “stigmatization” in response to the coronavirus was a policy endorsed by the World Health Organization itself on numerous occasions and adopted by the left-wing Italian government.

As we previously highlighted, the Mayor of Florence launched a nationwide campaign at the start of February encouraging Italians to hug Chinese people on the street to “stem the hatred.”

Footage of the stunt even shows Italians physically removing a Chinese man’s face mask while closely embracing him.

The Mayor even released a Twitter video of himself hugging an awkward-looking Chinese person to promote the campaign, which was launched to “express solidarity with the Chinese community.”

He said during a Coronavirus Task Force briefing that his administration will reevaluate the 15-day guideline the White House issued last week when that time is up and he will soon issue new guidelines on how to return to a more normalized workforce and economy.

""Our country wasn't built to be shut down. This is not a country that was built for this. It was not built to be shut down,"" Mr. Trump said in a briefing that heavily emphasized the need to reopen and boost businesses and the economy. ""... We're not gonna let the cure be worse than the problem.""

The president's tone Monday represented a significant shift after a week of the White House issuing dire warnings and urging people to take social distancing seriously. Only days ago, the president stood at the same podium warning Americans the outbreak could last into July or August.

Mr. Trump said Monday that the U.S. ""will soon be open for business,"" even as public health officials warned Americans should be prepared to continue social distancing and closures for the time being. Mr. Trump insisted the country has learned from altering habits and can ""do two things at one time"" — social distancing and returning people to work. He also said he thinks his public health officials aren't opposed to the idea of easing up on restrictions in the future.

Absent at Monday night's press conference was Dr. Anthony Fauci, leading expert in infectious diseases. Asked if Fauci agrees with his desire to move the economy back to normal soon, Mr. Trump said Fauci ""doesn't not agree.""

""He isn't here because we're not discussing what he's best at,"" Mr. Trump said. Fauci is a leading expert on infectious diseases and a key member of the Coronavirus Task Force, who has made himself available for a wide range of media interviews to inform the public.

As CBS News White House correspondent Paula Reid has reported, the president wants the economy to be set into gear as soon as possible, as business closures eliminate jobs and send the stock market spiraling.

The president announced the administration is working on distributing millions of masks to the hardest-hit areas.

""FEMA is distributing 8 million N95 respirator masks and 13.3 million surgical masks across the country right now. Focusing on the areas with the greatest need, we have shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to NYC and 36 pallets to the state of Washington,"" the president said.

Dr. Deborah Birx, a point person on the task force, said self-swab testing will be available soon. Birx said she tested negative for coronavirus after experiencing a low-grade fever over the weekend.

Over the weekend, Vice President Mike Pence's office announced a member of his staff tested positive for the virus. Pence said he and his wife tested negative, and Mr. Trump said Monday that first lady Melania Trump had tested negative. Mr. Trump was tested last week and the White House said he tested negative.

The Senate has so far failed to pass procedural votes to advance a coronavirus stimulus package, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she plans to submit her own proposal.

A growing number of governors are telling residents to stay in their homes and ordering businesses deemed nonessential to close their doors, ramping up the pressure on lawmakers to swiftly provide relief to those affected by the coronavirus. Mr. Trump told reporters Monday that he will be the oversight of any stimulus package.

Further adding to the tensions on Capitol Hill was the revelation that Senate Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, tested positive for the coronavirus. Following the announcement, two other GOP senators, Mike Lee and Mitt Romney of Utah, said they would be self-quarantining for 14 days because they came in contact with Paul.

Republican Senators Rick Scott of Florida and Cory Gardner of Colorado were already self-quarantining due to possible exposure to the coronavirus.

In total, five Republicans are self-quarantining and are unable to vote in the Senate, dwindling their ranks."
https://www.cbsnews.com/,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-vote-coronavirus-economic-stimulus-package-bill-2020-03-23/,2020-03-23T00:00:00,Senate again fails to advance coronavirus stimulus bill as deal remains elusive,"Washington — The Senate on Monday failed for the second time to clear a key procedural hurdle to advance a massive legislative package designed to provide economic relief to American workers and industries battered by the coronavirus outbreak, as tensions boiled over among senators who vocalized their frustrations with one another over negotiations.

Senate Democrats blocked the yet-to-be-finalized stimulus package from advancing in a vote of 49 to 46, denying Republicans the 60 votes needed to move forward. Monday's action was yet another setback for senators following a failed party-line procedural vote Sunday.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned it could be several days before the Senate can proceed to a vote on the deal and called the failed procedural vote ""mindless obstruction.""

The failure followed tense and heated exchanges on the Senate floor, with Republicans accusing Democrats of exploiting a crisis while time runs out to pull the economy back from the brink.

""The country is burning, and your side wants to play political games,"" Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota said. ""It's time to get this done. The American people expect us to act.""

McConnell urged the Senate to act with urgency as more states place stringent limitations on residents to limit the spread of the coronavirus, including by ordering businesses deemed nonessential to close.

""This is not a juicy political opportunity. This is a national emergency,"" McConnell said during remarks on the Senate floor before the votes.

McConnell accused Democrats of making 11th-hour demands that derailed progress on the package, including tax credits for solar energy and wind energy and new emissions standards for airlines, which are set to benefit from the stimulus package.

""Are you kidding me?"" the Kentucky Republican said, adding that Democrats decided their requests are ""more important than Americans' paychecks and the personal safety of doctors and nurses.""

McConnell continued to place blame on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who joined discussions over the legislative package Sunday morning.

""The speaker of the House flew back from San Francisco, and suddenly, the Senate's serious bipartisan process turned into this left-wing episode of 'Supermarket Sweep,' unrelated issues left and right,"" he said.

McConnell urged Democrats to unify with their Republican colleagues, warning the country ""doesn't have time for these political games.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, taking to the Senate floor after McConnell, cast a grim outlook for the second procedural vote, calling it ""irrelevant"" and saying negotiations are ongoing, just steps from the Senate chamber.

""Democrats will not stop working with our Republican counterparts until we get the job done,"" he said.

GOP senators descended to the floor of the chamber to express their outrage over the hold-up and accused Democrats of delaying aid as families continue to hurt.

Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, angrily denounced her Democratic colleagues for not agreeing to move forward.

""I cannot believe that the answer from our friends from the other side of the aisle is delay, delay, delay. No sense of urgency,"" she said. ""We don't have another day. We don't have another hour. We don't have another minute to delay acting.""

Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana said Americans are thinking that ""this country was founded by geniuses, but is being run by a bunch of idiots.""

""You know what the American people are thinking right now? They're thinking that the brain is an amazing organ — it starts working in a mother's womb and it doesn't stop working until you get elected to Congress,"" he said.

Discussions on the nearly $2 trillion stimulus package — likely to be the largest in history — continued into Sunday night and the morning, and Schumer told reporters the goal was to craft a bipartisan compromise on Monday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, met with Schumer at the Capitol in the morning.

It's unclear when a vote on final passage of the measure could take place, but McConnell had been pushing for the Senate to approve the stimulus package as early as Monday. The first two of three procedural votes set for Monday required 50 votes to pass, and the third vote required 60.

Further complicating negotiations was the announcement from Pelosi that she plans to introduce her own stimulus package Monday afternoon.

""The Senate Republicans' bill, as presented, put corporations first, not workers and families,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""Today, House Democrats will unveil a bill that takes responsibility for the health, wages and well-being of America's workers: the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act.""

In the run-up to Sunday's failed procedural vote, Republican senators had expressed optimism about a bipartisan compromise, which includes cash payments of $1,200 to American workers making up to $75,000; $350 billion in loans and grants for small businesses; and $50 billion in loans for airlines.

But Democrats said the package lacked adequate funding for hospitals and health care workers and gave too much money to large corporations without oversight. All 47 Senate Democrats voted together in blocking the measure from advancing Sunday.

The failed vote incensed Senate Republicans, some of which took to the Senate floor to express their frustration.

Immediately following the vote, a visibly angry McConnell blamed Pelosi for upending progress on the deal and urged Democrats to ""step up"" to help American workers and businesses.

""We're fiddling here, fiddling with the emotions of the American people, fiddling with the markets, fiddling with our healthcare, the American people expect us to act tomorrow,"" McConnell said Sunday. ""And I want everybody to fully understand if we aren't able to act tomorrow, it'll be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address this problem.""

Adding to the uncertainty on Capitol Hill was the revelation that Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky had tested positive for the coronavirus and would be self-quarantining.

The announcement led two other GOP senators, Mike Lee and Mitt Romney, both of Utah, to self-quarantine after coming into contact with Paul. Senators Cory Gardner and Rick Scott of Florida were already self-quarantining after possible exposure to the virus, meaning five senators in total had to miss Sunday's vote.

The stimulus package under discussion in the Senate is the third part of a multi-pronged legislative response to the coronavirus. Earlier this month, Congress passed a $8.3 billion emergency supplemental package, and last week, President Trump signed into law a coronavirus relief bill that provides free testing and paid leave for certain workers."

To date there is no proven medical way to stop this coronavirus - no treatment, no vaccine. The best defense has been tried-and-true public health measures: social distancing and hand washing. But the rapid spread of the deadly virus prompted medical researchers the world over to go on offense. Old medicines are being dusted off and repurposed, new vaccines are being developed in government and commercial labs. We went to Omaha, Nebraska, where one of those drugs is being tested on some of the sickest American patients.

At the University of Nebraska Medical Center, one of the eerier scenes we've witnessed in recent weeks. Cocooned inside that bubble, called an isopod - a 36-year-old woman - unlucky to have been infected with the new coronavirus, but lucky to be here. This facility was one of the first in the country built for outbreaks like this. Some of the sickest patients from the Diamond Princess cruise ship were taken there. Quarantined in Yokohama, Japan, more than 700 passengers and crew contracted the virus, including 67-year-old American Carl Goldman. He was quarantined here for a month. We had to talk to him through thick glass.

Carl Goldman talks with correspondent Bill Whitaker from quarantine. CBS News

Carl Goldman: When we landed in Omaha, more officials came onboard with hazmat suits. They unloaded me, put me on a stretcher. They were wheeling me through passageways that were deserted then up an elevator, and then into a room that was set up as a bio-containment room.

Bill Whitaker: They moved you to a bio-containment room?

Carl Goldman: Yeah.

Dr. Angela Hewlett is the medical director of the bio-containment unit, equipped to care for patients with highly contagious, dangerous diseases. Built in response to the 2001 anthrax scare, the unit is isolated from the rest of the medical center, with its own ventilation system, security access and highly trained staff: about 100 nurses, therapists, critical care and infectious disease doctors.

Bill Whitaker: How many patients can you treat at one time?

Dr. Angela Hewlett: We could actually accept up to probably eight patients in the biocontainment unit, totally dependent on how sick they are and how much equipment is required.

Bill Whitaker: How many facilities like this are there around the country?

Dr. Angela Hewlett: We have 10 regional treatment centers with those capabilities.

Bill Whitaker: Given the scope of this outbreak, that doesn't seem nearly enough. And when I see the Isopods being used to bring people into this facility, that makes me think that this is pretty bad.

Dr. Angela Hewlett: If we had a-- a therapeutic agent that we knew worked or if we had a vaccine that could help prevent the spread of this illness, then-- you know, then this would be something a little more controllable than what we have now.

Dr. Angela Hewlett CBS News

Researchers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center modeled a worst case scenario in the U.S.: over the course of a year, 96 million cases of COVID-19; 4.8 million hospitalizations; almost a half-million deaths. Scientists hope the measures the country is taking will keep the worst from happening, but the urgency of this moment has medical researchers all over the world racing to find some way to fight the killer virus. Last month, the National Institutes of Health tapped the Nebraska Medical Center to launch the first clinical trial in the U.S. of an antiviral drug, remdesivir, which is administered intravenously to treat patients who have already contracted the virus. It's being tested against a placebo.

Dr. Angela Hewlett: It was actually studied in Ebola, interestingly. Didn't work as well for Ebola. However-- there have been some animal studies as-- as well as some studies in the lab that demonstrate that it worked fairly well against illnesses like SARS and MERS, which are also coronaviruses.

Bill Whitaker: How does the drug work?

Dr. Angela Hewlett: It inhibits replication of the virus and so when a virus would normally try to reproduce itself, this drug inserts itself into that process and then stops viral replication, so it stops reproduction of the virus.

Bill Whitaker: This clinical trial is up and running in the middle of this outbreak.

Dr. Angela Hewlett: I will say this is the fastest clinical trial that I've ever seen come to-- to fruition in this amount of time.

Bill Whitaker: Ordinarily, how long would it take to get a trial up and running?

Dr. Angela Hewlett: that can range from many months to-- to years.

The maker of the anti-viral, remdesivir, Gilead Sciences in California, is ramping up production to provide multiple clinical trials in the U.S., Asia, and Europe. The U.S. Army also is testing the drug.

With no proven treatments, hundreds of trials of different drugs are underway worldwide. Researchers in the U.S. and China are investigating whether the common anti-malarial drug Chloroquine and related drugs might inhibit the virus. In New York, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is testing a cocktail of antibodies to see if they can temporarily boost immune systems to fight the virus.



Scripps Research in San Diego is using a robot to go through its extensive library of existing drugs looking for antiviral compounds to send to labs around the world to test if any combination might prove effective in combating the new coronavirus and quell the pandemic.

Kate Broderick: I can't express to you the pressure-- that I personally feel under, and I think the whole scientific community feels under. There's a great deal of responsibility-- in working towards a solution for this outbreak, literally as it's happening.

Scottish born Kate Broderick is Senior Vice President of Research and Development at Inovio Pharmaceuticals in San Diego. Employees are working against the clock to create a vaccine to prevent people from ever getting the virus. Inovio is using DNA biotechnology, cutting edge science that has yet to produce a marketable vaccine.

Bill Whitaker: How optimistic are you that this is the solution?

Kate Broderick: I feel very confident in the technology that we've developed here at Inovio. And I feel very cautiously optimistic that our vaccine will be effective when we test it in the clinic.

Correspondent Bill Whitaker speaks with Kate Broderick. CBS News

Inovio has already started testing its vaccine on animals and expects to start human trials next month. The company's race to create a vaccine was triggered by this: the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus. Chinese scientists posted it online just weeks after the outbreak was identified.

Kate Broderick: all we need is that genetic code. So it's just a series of A's, and T's, and C's, and G's that make up the blueprint to the virus. We use a computer algorithm to generate the design of the vaccine. So we plugged in the viral sequence. And after three hours, we had a fully designed vaccine on paper. And then, after that, the stages to manufacture went straight into effect.

Bill Whitaker: Three hours?

Kate Broderick: Yeah, absolutely.

Bill Whitaker: Is that unusually fast?

Kate Broderick: Certainly, if you're thinking of traditional vaccines. They take months to years.

Using the genetic code, Inovio scientists are able to zero in on the part of the deadly virus, these spikes, that attach to human cells. They then recreate that bit of coronavirus DNA in the lab. The synthetic snippet of virus is grown inside bacteria. After sloshing around all night, there are thousands, if not millions of copies of the synthetic DNA. Filtered and processed it looks like this. The vaccine is made from this liquid.

Kate Broderick: Then it's injected into the subject or the patient. And your own body is able to react and mount what we call an immune response against that part of the virus.

Stephen Hoge: I don't feel like we get to choose when an epidemic happens. We just get to decide how we're gonna respond. And what we've decided to do is try and use our platform to bring forward a safe and effective vaccine.

Former emergency room doctor, Stephen Hoge, is president of Moderna, a Boston area biotechnology company also working on a vaccine. We met Dr. Hoge shortly after the CDC recommended social distancing. Teaming up with the NIH, Moderna started human trials last week in Seattle, where the North American outbreak took hold. Forty-five healthy volunteers will receive injections over six weeks and be monitored for a year to see if the vaccine is safe. Moderna started work on the vaccine as soon as China posted the virus genetic sequence online.

Bill Whitaker: So how long did it take you to go from getting this genetic information to actually having a vaccine ready for human trial?

Stephen Hoge: 25 days. It was released to the clinic within 42 days. Dr. Tony Fauci called it the-- I think the world indoor record. But it's definitely faster than we think anybody's-- done before.

Moderna's process pushes the envelope of biotechnology. Its scientists manipulate the genetic code to instruct cells what to do - in this case trigger the body's immune system to fight the new coronavirus.

Stephen Hoge: Once you realize that you can essentially put a software-like program into a cell the opportunities to address human disease are pretty broad.

Bill Whitaker: How did your relatively small biotech get to be the first one to go into human trials?

Stephen Hoge: Some of that has the advantage of the technology we're using. it allows us to move incredibly quickly-- when we have a pandemic situation like the one we're in.

Bill Whitaker: So you-- you have never brought a-- vaccine to market using this technology.

Stephen Hoge: No. We have not.

Bill Whitaker: Have not?

Stephen Hoge: We have not yet.

Stephen Hoge CBS News

The National Institutes of Health is collaborating with Moderna to accelerate the development of a coronavirus vaccine. They hope to start a second phase of human trials in a few months.

Bill Whitaker: The whole world is sort of watching and waiting. So if you find that this works, when will people be able to start getting vaccines?

Stephen Hoge: Well, if we're able to show there's a clear benefit-- we're gonna need to be able to make sure that it's accessible to everybody who needs it. And so we've actually already started the investment to scale up supply into the millions of doses. But ultimately what we really need to focus on is generating the clinical data that shows that the vaccine, in fact, does have a benefit, that it's safe and effective.

Bill Whitaker: this is the purest form--

Kate Broderick: This is-- this is the purest form of the DNA.

Kate Broderick of Inovio told us technology is accelerating vaccine development, but it's no match for people's expectations.

Bill Whitaker: what is the realistic timeline for this vaccine being administered to the public?

Kate Broderick: We're hoping to have our vaccine tested in what we call a large, phase two trial by the end of the year, which would be potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of subjects being treated. But to have it rolled out to the public is likely to take longer than that.

Bill Whitaker: So the best case scenario is more than a year. Any way to speed up that process?

Kate Broderick: Really, I-- I have to say, we're going as absolutely fast as we possibly can.

With the number of people with the virus growing exponentially and deaths climbing inexorably that timeline just doesn't seem fast enough. With so much human suffering, hospitals in the U.S., Europe and Japan have given several hundred desperate patients the experimental antiviral drug, remdesivir, for what is called compassionate use. That's the drug being studied in clinical trial at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.

Dr. Angela Hewlett: We wanna make sure that, you know, we're not giving-- drugs to people that could have side effects.

Bill Whitaker: Now I know you don't know who's getting the drug and who's getting the placebo. But from what you've observed of the patients who are in the trial, what have you seen?

Dr. Angela Hewlett: So we have seen patients improve.

Bill Whitaker: You have?

Dr. Angela Hewlett: but it-- it's hard to tell if they would've just gotten better on their own, or if was due to the drug. And that's the reason that we really need to study this drug in this fashion.

Director of the CDC, Dr. Robert Redfield, told Congress this month we should know in a matter of weeks whether remdesivir is effective. But until a proven treatment and vaccine are available to fight this pandemic, doctors and researchers will keep working at a fevered pitch.

Bill Whitaker: Is this like a race to get to a vaccine?

Stephen Hoge: not really.

Bill Whitaker: How would you describe it?

Stephen Hoge: there's a lot of fear out there right now. And there is a competition. But it's not between the companies. It's between all of us and the virus. It's not us and them. It's us versus it. And the only way we're gonna beat the coronavirus is all working together. No one group, no one company can possibly expect to do this alone.
