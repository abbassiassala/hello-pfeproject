The number of confirmed cases has almost doubled in the past week, with many imported from overseas, as Hong Kong residents who had left -- either to work or study abroad, or to seek safety when the city seemed destined for a major outbreak earlier this year -- return, bringing the virus back with them\n\nOn Monday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced that all non-residents would be barred from the territory as of Wednesday, the latest addition to a raft of new measures.\n\nThis is a pattern playing out across parts of Asia -- mainland China, Singapore, Taiwan -- that were among the first to tackle the outbreak. All are now introducing new restrictions as a sudden wave of renewed cases begins to crest.\n\nCompared to major cities in the West, like London or New York, residents in Hong Kong can sometimes feel as if they're living in the future. Many of the measures enacted in the Asian metropolis back in February are now being rolled out in European and American cities.\n\nBut this latest lesson may be a bitter pill to swallow, as it indicates that quarantines and social distancing must continue well beyond the initial wave of cases, if another round of infections is to be avoided.\n\nFor those just going into lockdown, that could mean they're in for the long haul.\n\nOffice workers and pedestrians wearing protective masks walk along Queen's Road Central in the Central district of Hong Kong on Friday, March 20, 2020.\n\nWaves of infection\n\nOn March 2, after several weeks of working from home, the majority of Hong Kong's 180,000 civil servants returned to their offices . Private employers, which have largely been taking their lead from the government, followed suit, and the city's subway system, though never exactly empty, was suddenly flush with people again.\n\nThis seemed like a reasonable measure at the time. Even as cases were on the rise in Italy and elsewhere, there were then only 100 confirmed in Hong Kong, and in mainland China the number of new infections was beginning to stabilize.\n\nIt was natural therefore that people began to relax somewhat, not only going to work instead of staying home, but also having dinner together, going to the park, and attending weddings and other large social gatherings. While face masks were still common, some people could be spotted going uncovered, particularly for short trips, and there was a general sense of slowly getting back to normal.\n\nIn the week that followed the March 2 return to work, there were only five new cases in Hong Kong, most of which were imported. Numbers remained low until around March 16, when dozens of new cases were confirmed. It soon became clear that while the majority were coming from overseas, quarantine measures in place were not sufficient, and local transmission had resumed.\n\nSince then, the city has been racing to get back on top of the outbreak, with draconian new controls put in place, including electronic tagging of all new arrivals, who must undergo a strict 14-day home quarantine, and could face criminal prosecution if they are found in breach of it. Over the weekend, police could be seen patrolling nightlife districts looking for those violating quarantine, arresting at least five people , two of whom had cut their wristbands off in order to go out.\n\nAs of Monday, civil servants are working from home again, and many private businesses are expected to follow suit. One of the government's top health advisers has warned that authorities may have to order a more comprehensive shutdown and provide financial assistance to those affected, if it is to contain the new wave of infections.\n\nAll non-residents will be barred from the territory as of Wednesday. The city's international airport will also no longer allow travelers to transit through Hong Kong. Anyone arriving in the city will have to undergo testing, regardless of their origin. Many bars and restaurants will also be closed, with initial restrictions focused on those serving alcohol.\n\nArrivals at Hong Kong airport on March 18 seen wearing heavy protective gear against the novel coronavirus.\n\nNo time to relax\n\nSpeaking Saturday, Lam said that so far the city has \"effectively and safely sailed through two waves of epidemic.\"\n\n\"The first wave was the worries of transmissions from mainland (China), so we have put in a lot of measures,\" she said. \"The second wave was the local transmissions, with those clusters arising from dinners and other things. Now we are facing the third wave.\"\n\nLam said that it was \"only natural\" that as the number of new cases subsides, people start \"to relax a bit,\" and this is what happened towards the start of March. But she said that \"in light of the changing circumstances and this most difficult and challenging wave arising from a surge in the global situation and the large number of returnees, then we have to adjust.\"\n\nSingapore on Sunday introduced stringent new restrictions on travelers from overseas, as that city too struggles with imported cases and a potential second wave. Taiwan, another territory credited with effectively containing the initial outbreak, is also adopting new measures to avoid a spike in imported infections.\n\nIn the Chinese capital Beijing, all international flights are now being diverted to other cities in China, as the number of imported cases continues to rise.\n\nAsia is weeks, if not months, ahead of the West when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. Countries across Europe and North America were slow to learn from those who had already been through it, leaving themselves vulnerable to the rapidly worsening health crises they are experiencing now."}, {"link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/a758ey1Nb3c/index.html", "published": "2020-03-23T10:57:39", "title": "India coronavirus: Millions under lockdown as major cities restrict daily life", "text": "(CNN) Millions of people across India have been placed under lockdown until the end of the month as efforts to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country intensify.\n\nResidents living in 75 districts across the country, including in major cities such as the capital New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Kolkata have been placed under travel, work and movement restrictions until March 31.\n\nIndia -- the world's second most populous country -- has 415 cases of the coronavirus, including seven deaths, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. A sudden rise in cases has led to growing concerns over the country's capacity to test for the virus and that a major outbreak on the scale seen in Europe -- the pandemic's new epicenter -- will spread in the country.\n\nDr. Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said that India has conducted 5,000 tests in the past week and a total of 15,000 so far. There are 111 labs operational with a per week testing capacity of 60,000 to 70,000 and around 60 more private labs are in the process of being approved to further increase testing capacity, according to Bhargava.\n\nThe decision to lock down parts of the country comes after India launched the world's biggest exercise in social distancing on Sunday, with the nation's 1.3 billion people asked to observe a self-imposed quarantine for 14 hours.\n\nFrom 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sunday, offices and businesses shut, people stayed inside their homes, and the usually busy streets, markets and highways were eerily empty across the nation. In a display of public solidarity expressing thanks to the nation's healthcare workers, people across India stood in their doorways and on balconies applauding, ringing bells and blowing conch shells, following similar scenes days prior in Italy and Spain.\n\nThe \"public curfew,\" announced by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, was a test on whether an official curfew could be imposed across the country to stop the spread of Covid-19 . Those restrictions were extended across large parts of the country late Sunday, effectively forcing millions of workers in India's huge technology and financial sector to work from home for the rest of the month.\n\nIn New Delhi, public transportation, including the metro and rickshaws, has been suspended, all shops, factories, places of worship and offices have been shut, interstate travel has stopped, borders with neighboring states have closed and people are required to stay in their homes until March 31.\n\nExempt from the order are essential services such as grocery stores, hospitals, pharmacies, petrol stations, telecoms and postal services and restaurants that deliver food.\n\n\"Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures,\" Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Sunday.\n\nSeveral districts, including the financial capital of Mumbai, have banned gatherings of four or more people, and officials can take legal action against those who violate the rule.\n\nNumerous state governments have extended the \"district-ban\" to include their entire states. In the northern Indian state of Punjab, the chief minister announced that, except for essential services, the whole state will be under a lockdown until March 31. Punjab has confirmed more than 20 cases, including one death.\n\nUttarakhand, Rajasthan and Telangana have all initiated state-wide lockdowns versus targeted restrictions of cities and districts.\n\nThe central government advised the restrictions in 75 districts as these are places where coronavirus cases have been reported. Local governments can extend those restrictions to other areas at their discretion.\n\nMaharashtra state, which includes Mumbai and Pune, has reported the most cases, with at least 67 infections, according to government figures. Kerala reported at least 52 cases and New Delhi has at least 26.\n\nIn the past few weeks, India has taken unprecedented steps to shut its borders, cancel visas and ban passengers from certain countries from entering Indian airspace.\n\nOn Sunday, India suspended passenger train services until March 31 after several travelers tested positive for coronavirus. India's mammoth railway network spans more than 760 million kilometers (472 million miles) and carried 8 billion passengers in 2018-19.\n\nAsia spurred into action\n\nThe measures in India come as other Asian nations see jumps in cases and rush to implement emergency measures of their own.\n\nOn Sunday, Thailand reported 188 new novel coronavirus cases, its biggest single-day rise, bringing its total to 599. Thailand's Ministry of Public Health has announced new measures, which include the closure of dine-in restaurants, shopping malls and amusement parks.\n\nFears of a second surge in cases from patients traveling from overseas has prompted officials in China to divert all Beijing-bound international flights to other cities starting on Monday.\n\nChina confirmed 39 additional cases of coronavirus as of the end of day Sunday, according to the country's National Health Commission -- all were imported cases.\n\nSingapore said it will shut its borders to all short-term visitors and travelers transiting though the city starting from Monday, according to its Health Ministry, which said the majority of its new infections were \"imported cases.\"\n\nOn Monday, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced new measures that \"place the most significant restriction on New Zealanders' movements in modern history.\"\n\nThe country will issue its highest alert level in 48 hours and close all non-essential businesses across the country, such as bars, gyms, and cinemas. All schools will be closed from Tuesday while supermarkets and service stations will remain open, Ardern said.\n\nAustralia has also taken unprecedented measures in its response to the pandemic. Businesses across the country on Monday followed the government's orders to shut down bars, restaurants, gyms, places of worship and other venues where people traditionally congregate.\n\n\"Life is changing in Australia for every Australian and life is going to continue to change,\" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. \"For many young and old, 2020 will be the toughest year of our lives.\"\n\nThe state of South Australia declared a \"major emergency\" and shut its border with the rest of the country on Sunday after an increase in confirmed cases from travelers entering the state.\n\nSouth Australia's Premier Steven Marshall said anyone entering South Australia \"will be required to undertake 14 days of self-isolation.\"\n\nThe country's biggest state, New South Wales, will shut down all \"non-essential services\" in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus. The measures come after both Tasmania and the Northern Territory introduced similar measures requiring all travelers to self-isolate for 14-days upon entry into the state.\n\nOlympics could be postponed\n\nAs sporting events across the world have been canceled, one of the biggest questions remains over whether the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics will go ahead.\n\nSpeaking to lawmakers on Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said postponing the Olympics was a possibility.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) said that a final decision on postponement will be made within four weeks, due to the vast complexities of rescheduling a massive global sporting event like the Olympics.\n\n\"The IOC's decision is along the lines of what I said before, of holding the event in its complete form. If that becomes difficult -- and thinking first about the health of the athletes -- we may have no option but to consider postponing the Games,\" Abe said, speaking at the budget committee in Japan's upper house of parliament.\n\nIt's the first time that Abe has changed his staunch public position that the Olympics will start on July 24 as scheduled.\n\nIn recent days, a growing number of countries and athletes have called for the Games to be postponed. On Monday, Canada announced that it wouldn't be sending athletes, making it the first country to back out of the Games.\n\n\"This is not solely about athlete health -- it is about public health,\" Team Canada said in a statement. \"With Covid-19 and the associated risks, it is not safe for our athletes, and the health and safety of their families and the broader Canadian community for athletes to continue training towards these Games.\"\n\nAustralia's Olympic Committee has also told its athletes to prepare for the possibility that the Games could be postponed until 2021.\n\nScrapping the Olympics during peacetime would be unprecedented -- they have only been canceled before during the two World Wars."}, {"link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/9OLdKlD5xjw/index.html", "published": "2020-03-23T00:23:59", "title": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel goes into self-quarantine", "text": "(CNN) German Chancellor Angela Merkel will self-quarantine after coming into contact with a person who tested positive for coronavirus, her spokesperson said Sunday.\n\nSteffen Seibert, the spokesperson, said a doctor gave her a vaccination on Friday, then tested positive for the virus shortly after.

The move is part of social distancing measures to minimise non-essential contact.\n\nPeople with flu-like symptoms - such as a dry cough and high temperature - are being asked to self-isolate at home to avoid infecting others.\n\nAnd the NHS is contacting about 1.5 million people with serious health conditions to urge them not to go out for at least 12 weeks. This is known as shielding.\n\nWhy is social distancing necessary?\n\nSocial distancing is important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or can cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, and then touch your face with unwashed hands.\n\nThe less time people spend together, the less chance there is of this happening.\n\nWhat social distancing involves\n\nWork from home whenever possible\n\nAvoid all unnecessary travel\n\nStay away from crowded places\n\nAvoid gatherings with friends and families wherever possible\n\nStay two metres from other people\n\nWhat am I allowed to do when social distancing?\n\nYou can see family and friends if it's essential\n\nYou can walk your dog\n\nYou can provide essential care for elderly relatives and neighbours if you have no symptoms\n\nYou can go to the shops to buy food and groceries\n\nYou can exercise at a safe distance from others\n\nCan I go out for a walk?\n\nEven though people are being urged to stay home, Mr Hancock says \"it is important that people get exercise\".\n\nHowever, they should still keep 2m away from others.\n\nImage copyright Wales News Service Image caption Crowds have also been heading for the coast, including to Barry Island\n\nIn order to enforce the 2m rule, some authorities have taken action.\n\nA number of parks in London, for example, are being closed.\n\nElsewhere, car parks and trails in Snowdonia may also close and the National Trust has also been closing parks and gardens.\n\nWhat about other countries?\n\nSome countries have gone further than the UK to make sure people keep their distance.\n\nGermany, for example, has banned meetings of more than two. That means people will not be allowed to form groups of three or more in public unless they live together in the same household, or the gathering is work-related.\n\nFrance is using more than 100,000 police and gendarme officers to enforce its confinement measures. Anyone found not following the rules will receive a 135 euro fine.\n\nWhat is self-isolation?\n\nSelf-isolating means staying at home and not leaving it, other than for exercise. Don't go to work, school or public areas during this time.\n\nIf possible, you should not go out even to buy food or other essentials. If you are unable to get supplies delivered, you should do what you can to limit social contact when you do leave the house.\n\nWho should self-isolate?\n\nEveryone who shows coronavirus symptoms - a fever of above 37.8C, a persistent cough or breathing problem - and everyone who lives in the same house or flat as someone with symptoms.\n\nIf you live alone, you must stay at home for seven days from the day symptoms start\n\nIf you, or someone you live with, develop symptoms, the entire household needs to isolate for 14 days to monitor for signs of Covid-19\n\nIf someone else does become ill during that period, their seven-day isolation starts that day. For example, it might run from day three to day 10 - when that person's isolation would then end. It would not restart if another member of the household fell ill\n\nBut anyone who fell ill on day 13 would see their seven-day isolation begin then - for their illness rather than to monitor for symptoms - meaning they would spend a total of 20 days at home\n\nThe person with the symptoms should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, and keep away from other people in the home.\n\nPeople are being advised not to ring NHS 111 or their GP to report their symptoms unless they are worried.\n\nWho shouldn't go out at all?\n\nAbout 1.5 million people with very serious health conditions will be contacted by the NHS and urged not go out at all for at least 12 weeks. This is being referred to as shielding.\n\nOthers in the same household, and carers, can go out as long they observe proper social distancing.\n\nThe most vulnerable group includes:\n\nCertain types of cancer patients\n\nOrgan transplant patients\n\nPeople with certain genetic diseases\n\nPeople with serious respiratory conditions like cystic fibrosis and severe chronic bronchitis\n\nPeople receiving certain drug treatments which suppress the immune system\n\nPregnant women with heart disease\n\nThey will be contacted with advice on how to manage their self-isolation, including getting supplies of essential food and medicines.\n\nThe government says it will work with local authorities, supermarkets and the armed forces to ensure this happens.\n\nWhat happens if you have a vulnerable person living with you during self-isolation?\n\nYou should keep at least 2m away from a vulnerable person (such as pregnant women, the elderly or those with an underlying health condition) during any period of isolation, according to PHE.\n\nLimit time spent together in shared spaces, like kitchens, and keep all rooms well-ventilated. If they can, the vulnerable person should take their meals back to their room to eat.\n\nA vulnerable person should also use separate towels from the rest of the household.

That campaign would end about March 31,\u201d reported Newsmax. \u201cThe discussions centered on what to do after the 15-day period ends, and how to test and isolate everyone who\u2019s sick so healthy people can return to work. It\u2019s likely the CDC guidelines would be relaxed rather than scrapped altogether, one person said.\u201d\n\nThe president is now facing a dilemma in which further lockdowns in response to the coronavirus would lead to a recession as bad as \u2013 if not worse than \u2013 the 2008 Great Recession, especially given how many Americans are heavily in consumer debt and are thus living paycheck-to-paycheck.\n\nAccording to libertarian commentator Kristin Tate:\n\nFinancial planners suggest saving at least 20 percent of take home income, while spending at most 30 percent on discretionary items. Yet too many workers still fail to think twice about spending entire paychecks for things they want but do not need.\n\nRecent decades have offered us relative luxury. More than 80 percent of Americans own smartphones. The same portion of households own one high definition flat screen television, while over half of households own more than one. Over 60 percent of Americans dine out at least once a week, while nearly 20 percent dine out three or more times a week.\n\nIt\u2019s a brewing economic crisis that President Trump has already publicly lamented on, and his response to a tweet by constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes reveals the president is getting more hesitant about lockdowns, martial law and other escalating government responses to the coronavirus which would derail the economy for years.\n\nWE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.

Kim and her spouse, who requested anonymity to avoid possible problems with her employer, wore flowing white dresses.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBy doing a factory wedding, I thought that I might give a message: that we\u2019re just people, we\u2019re just Koreans, we just want to get married like everyone else,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it was a political choice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAdvocates for same-sex marriage in South Korea, and many of its East Asian neighbors, remain mostly on the sidelines of national debate. South Korea\u2019s vibrant online culture, however, offers a forum to challenge views on a range of gender-related issues, from same-sex relationships to the pay gap for women to the definitions of beauty promoted by the country\u2019s huge cosmetic-surgery industry.\n\nKim, 28, started giving interviews, including during prime time on national broadcaster KBS and another on the main news page of KakaoTalk, South Korea\u2019s leading messaging app.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI thought that this would influence society and the government,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I did it for my own good.\u201d\n\nThen came the backlash.\n\nThe article received about 10,000 comments, 80 percent of which were negative, she said. Some people told the couple to \u201cGet out of Korea.\u201d Others worried that society and families would fall apart on a tide of lesbian weddings. Some replies were intensely malicious, threatening and sexual.\n\nAD\n\nAfter consulting a lawyer, and pushing the police to talk to portal sites, she is suing the 100 most malicious commentators.\n\n\u201cMy mom has always been quite negative of my sexuality, but my dad has supported me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when it came to going public, not so much.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKim\u2019s parents come from the socially conservative region of Busan in southeastern South Korea. Her grandparents are very conservative, she said, and her father was worried.\n\n\u201cHe claimed that he was worried that I might get too much attention, and there might be malicious comments like, from, I don\u2019t know, churches,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think deep down he was quite scared that people around him would find out that I am lesbian.\u201d\n\nHer father felt his daughter wasn\u2019t listening to him. They argued, he didn\u2019t come to her wedding in Seoul, and now they aren\u2019t talking to each other.\n\nKim with her spouse, who requested anonymity to avoid possible problems with her employer. (Hoseon Lee/Jintaeyong Photography)\n\nKim and her spouse are not the first couple to test South Korea\u2019s legal and societal boundaries on same-sex marriage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2013, filmmaker Kim Jho Gwang-soo celebrated a symbolic marriage ceremony with his longtime male partner. The pair exchanged vows in public on a bridge and afterward fought an unsuccessful legal battle to register their union.\n\nThe church and conservatives oppose same-sex unions, often vehemently. Right-wing lawmakers introduced legislation last year that would remove any reference to \u201csexual orientation\u201d as a possible source of discrimination under the mandate of the National Human Rights Commission of Korea.\n\nEven liberal President Moon Jae-in, a former human rights lawyer, said on the campaign trail in 2017 that he disliked homosexuality and had \u201cno intention\u201d of legalizing it.\n\nAD\n\nAs president, Moon has said he opposes discrimination, but he has also said that society \u201chas yet to reach a consensus\u201d on legalizing same-sex unions and that the issue needs more discussion.\n\nAD\n\nHuman Rights Watch reported in November that LGBT youth in South Korea experienced indifference or outright hostility that left them feeling isolated and jeopardized their mental health.\n\nKim said she feels attitudes are gradually changing. South Korea\u2019s largest alcoholic drinks company, Oriental Brewery, posted its support for the Seoul Queer Culture Festival on social media in May with a rainbow-colored can, a first for a major South Korean company.\n\nKim said she was worried that she and her spouse would be turned away from wedding halls in Seoul. Then her wedding planner called and asked.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe owner replied, \u2018It\u2019s the same money, what\u2019s the big deal?\u2019 \u201d Kim said. Nor were their hairdressers or other suppliers bothered, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that [South] Korea is very capitalist \u2014 everything is consumer first,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the private sector is beginning to look at gay people as customers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKim\u2019s employer, a European consumer goods company, treats the pair as a married couple. She dreams of one day being its first non-European, first female and first openly gay chief executive \u2014 a \u201ctotem of diversity,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the couple still face many obstacles in their daily lives.\n\nTheir incomes are treated as separate for the purpose of securing a mortgage, they cannot sign medical consent forms as next-of-kin, and for inheritances, Korean law gives close family members automatic precedence, leaving anything that benefits an unmarried partner vulnerable to legal challenge.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the ceremony in Manhattan, the couple honeymooned in the Seychelles, but their return to South Korea was a slap back to reality."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/pompeo-makes-unannounced-afghan-visit-to-mediate-political-crisis/2020/03/23/5b20ca98-6cd2-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-03-23T12:29:00", "title": "Pompeo makes unannounced Afghan visit to mediate political crisis", "text": "The Afghan government has been at a tense stalemate for nearly two weeks, with no progress made on plans to begin negotiations between Afghan and Taliban leaders over the country\u2019s future political system. Those talks were scheduled to begin by March 10, after U.S. officials signed an agreement with Taliban representatives Feb. 29 that would allow thousands of U.S. troops to begin leaving the country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPompeo was greeted on arrival by Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. diplomat who has been leading peace talks with the Taliban for the past year. In the past week, Khalilzad has been attempting to smooth relations between Ghani and Abdullah, but he appears to have made scant progress. Afghan political and religious leaders have also been mediating between them, to no avail.\n\nThe secretary\u2019s announced schedule includes a lengthy private meeting with Ghani, followed by a similar one with Abdullah. After that, the two Afghan leaders were scheduled to meet alone, followed by a final meeting with Pompeo. After brief meetings with Afghan security officials, Pompeo was scheduled to leave the country early Monday evening.\n\nThe unusual and quick visit here by the top U.S. diplomat appears to reflect the high level of frustration in Washington over the high-stakes political standoff in Kabul, which has aroused concerns here that a civil war could erupt. Abdullah, who claims he was cheated out of victory at the polls, is backed by an array of powerful former ethnic warlords.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPompeo\u2019s apparent mediation mission is eerily reminiscent of the last Afghan presidential election in 2014, when then-Secretary of State John F. Kerry successfully mediated an identical spat between Ghani and Abdullah. Both claimed to have won the presidency in a fraud-marred election, but Kerry persuaded them to accept a power-sharing arrangement that has proven tense and fractious.\n\nPompeo is also likely to raise a second issue with Ghani that has undercut the Taliban peace deal almost from the day it was signed. The agreement reached in Qatar called for an exchange of prisoners in which the Ghani government would released 5,000 Taliban fighters and the Taliban would release 1,000 captured Afghan government forces.\n\nThe Afghan president, however, strongly objected, saying that releasing so many insurgents would rob the government of significant leverage in future talks and would risk freeing large numbers of enemy fighters who might well return to the battle. In the past 10 days, his aides have been assessing lists of prisoners and said they are willing to release a smaller number who are old, sick or otherwise less likely to go back to fighting.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKhalilzad has also been trying to help work out an agreement on prisoners, and over the weekend he said in a tweet that he had facilitated a video conference meeting between Taliban and Afghan prison officials on \u201ctechnical\u201d aspects of the release. He did not say whether or when any release would start.\n\nPompeo, who attended the peace agreement signing in Doha, the Qatari capital, said at the time that the path forward would be \u201crocky\u201d and that launching meaningful negotiations between the Taliban and Afghan leaders over a shared role in governing would be difficult. But he also said that while Taliban leaders have \u201can enormous amount of blood on their hands, they have now made a break\u201d from their past and have promised not to allow anti-U.S. terrorist activities on Afghan soil.\n\nThe agreement, which was widely criticized by Afghans as giving too much leeway to the Taliban, called for both sides to observe a brief \u201creduction in violence.\u201d It also included a Taliban anti-terrorism pledge and called for intra-Afghan talks to begin within a short time.\n\nAD\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-korea-says-trump-wrote-kim-jong-un-a-letter-offering-to-help-out-with-coronavirus/2020/03/22/a3facf9a-6c35-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-03-22T13:28:00", "title": "Trump writes North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un to offer help against the coronavirus", "text": "\u201cWe view such a personal letter of President Trump as a good example showing the special and firm personal relations with Chairman Kim Jong Un,\u201d said Kim Yo Jong, the leader\u2019s sister and a senior official of the ruling party.

North Korea demanded sanctions relief in exchange for partial disarmament steps.\n\nAD\n\nTrump had a brief encounter with Kim at a border town between the South and North in June.
